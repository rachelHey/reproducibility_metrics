We manually chose articles with executable queries. The reproducibility of each query was assessed by replicating it in the MAUDE Application Programming Interface. The reproducibility of a query is determined by a reproducibility coefficient that ranges from 0.95 to 1.05. This coefficient is calculated by comparing the number of medical device reports (MDRs) returned by the reproduced queries to the number of reported MDRs in the original studies. We also computed the reproducibility ratio, which is the fraction of reproducible queries in subgroups divided by the query complexity, the device category, and the presence of a data processing flow.; Results: As of August 8, 2022, we identified 523 articles from which 336 contained queries, and 60 of these were executable. Among these, 14 queries were reproducible. Queries using a single field like product code, product class, or brand name showed higher reproducibility (50%, 33.3%, 31.3%) compared with other fields (8.3%, P = 0.037). Single-category device queries exhibited a higher reproducibility ratio than multicategory ones, but without statistical significance (27.1% versus 8.3%, P = 0.321). Studies including a data processing flow had a higher reproducibility ratio than those without, although this difference was not statistically significant (42.9% versus 17.4%, P = 0.107).; Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the reproducibility of queries in MAUDE data-driven studies is limited. Enhancing this requires the development of more effective MAUDE data query strategies and improved application programming interfaces.; Competing Interests: The authors disclose no conflict of interest.

Such initiatives center around various rules to which authors must adhere to demonstrate their engagement in best practices. Preliminary evidence in the psychological science literature demonstrates a degree of efficacy in these initiatives. With such efficacy in place, it would be advantageous for other fields of behavioral sciences to adopt similar measures. This letter provides a discussion on lessons learned from psychological science while similarly addressing the unique challenges of other sciences to adopt measures that would be most appropriate for their field. We offer broad considerations for peer-reviewed journals in their implementation of specific policies and recommend that governing bodies of science prioritize the funding of research that addresses these measures.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=38328875&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Micheloud, Charlotte</author><author>Balabdaoui, Fadoua</author><author>Held, Leonhard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing Replicability with the Sceptical P-value: Type-I Error Control and Sample Size Planning</title><secondary-title>Statistica Neerlandica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Statistica Neerlandica</full-title><abbr-1>Statistica Neerlandica</abbr-1></periodical><pages>573-591</pages><volume>77</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Design of Experiments: General C90</keyword><keyword>Econometric and Statistical Methods and Methodology: General C10</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00390402</isbn><abstract>We study a statistical framework for replicability based on a recently proposed quantitative measure of replication success, the sceptical p-value. A recalibration is proposed to obtain exact overall Type-I error control if the effect is null in both studies and additional bounds on the partial and conditional Type-I error rate, which represent the case where only one study has a null effect. The approach avoids the double dichotomization for significance of the two-trials rule and has larger project power to detect existing effects over both studies in combination. It can also be used for power calculations and requires a smaller replication sample size than the two-trials rule for already convincing original studies. We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology in an application to data from the Experimental Economics Replication Project.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=2095870&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Costigan, Samantha</author><author>Ruscio, John</author><author>Crawford, Jarret T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Performing small-telescopes analysis by resampling: Empirically constructing confidence intervals and estimating statistical power for measures of effect size</title><secondary-title>Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science</full-title><abbr-1>Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science</abbr-1></periodical><volume>7</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>Confidence Limits (Statistics)</keyword><keyword>Effect Size (Statistical)</keyword><keyword>Experimental Replication</keyword><keyword>Quantitative Methods</keyword><keyword>Sampling (Experimental)</keyword><keyword>small-telescopes</keyword><keyword>Statistical Analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2515-2459</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/25152459241227865</electronic-resource-num><abstract>When new data are collected to check the findings of an original study, it can be challenging to evaluate replication results. The small-telescopes method is designed to assess not only whether the effect observed in the replication study is statistically significant but also whether this effect is large enough to have been detected in the original study. Unless both criteria are met, the replication either fails to support the original findings or the results are mixed. When implemented in the conventional manner, this small-telescopes method can be impractical or impossible to conduct, and doing so often requires parametric assumptions that may not be satisfied. We present an empirical approach that can be used for a variety of study designs and data-analytic techniques. The empirical approach to the small-telescopes method is intended to extend its reach as a tool for addressing the replication crisis by evaluating findings in psychological science and beyond. In the present tutorial, we demonstrate this approach using a Shiny app and R code and included an analysis of most studies (95%) replicated as part of the Open Science Collaborationâs Reproducibility Project in Psychology. In addition to its versatility, simulations demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the empirical approach to implementing small-telescopes analysis.

At issue is the fact that conclusions about replication success often depend on the measure used for evaluating correspondence in results. Despite the importance of choosing an appropriate measure, there is still no widespread agreement about which measures should be used. This article addresses these questions by describing formally the most commonly used measures for assessing replication success, and by comparing their performance in different contexts according to their replication probabilitiesâthat is, the probability of obtaining replication success given study-specific settings. The measures may be characterized broadly as conclusion-based approaches, which assess the congruence of two independent studiesâ conclusions about the presence of an effect, and distance-based approaches, which test for a significant difference or equivalence of two effect estimates. We also introduce a new measure for assessing replication success called the correspondence test, which combines a difference and equivalence test in the same framework. To help researchers plan prospective replication efforts, we provide closed formulas for power calculations that can be used to determine the minimum detectable effect size (and thus, sample sizes) for each study so that a predetermined minimum replication probability can be achieved. Finally, we use a replication data set from the Open Science Collaboration (2015) to demonstrate the extent to which conclusions about replication success depend on the correspondence measure selected.

In these large-scale replication projects, replication has typically been evaluated based on a single replication study of some original study and dichotomously as successful or failed. However, evaluations of replicability that are based on a single study and are dichotomous are inadequate, and evaluations of replicability should instead be based on multiple studies, be continuous, and be multi-faceted. Further, such evaluations are in fact possible due to two characteristics shared by many large-scale replication projects. In this article, we provide such an evaluation for two prominent large-scale replication projects, one which replicated a phenomenon from cognitive psychology and another which replicated 13 phenomena from social psychology and behavioral economics. Our results indicate a very high degree of replicability in the former and a medium to low degree of replicability in the latter. They also suggest an unidentified covariate in each, namely ocular dominance in the former and political ideology in the latter, that is theoretically pertinent. We conclude by discussing evaluations of replicability at large, recommendations for future large-scale replication projects, and design-based model generalization.

The experiment involved children making decisions about distributing sweets between themselves and either an inâgroup or an outâgroup recipient. Fehr et al. found that (1) inequity aversion develops with age; (2) 3â to 4âyearâold children are inclined toward selfâadvantageous allocations, whereas 7â to 8âyearâolds distribute sweets more evenly in divisions, and (3) the influence of group status increases as children age. The original article stated that 229 Swiss school students aged 3 to 8 years (102 boys, 127 girls) participated in the study. However, no further demographics were reported. In our attempts to reproduce Fehr et al.'s original analyses and reanalyse the raw dataset, we found that one of the key variables was miscoded. After rectifying the miscoded variable, the reproduction results revealed only one ambiguously irreproducible result regarding a group status main effect in the sharing miniâgameâwith three other tests exhibiting either strong reproducibility or ambiguous reproducibility. Reanalysis results indicated that Fehr et al.'s conclusions are robust when tested with alternative analytical tests. Highlights We evaluated the reproducibility of Fehr et al.'s (2008) highly cited developmental resource allocation findings. After identifying an inversely coded variable, we found all testsâbar one probit regression not related to major findingsâto be reproducible. Reanalysis confirmed the robustness of Fehr et al.'s conclusions when using alternate analytical methods. Fehr et al.'s developmental resource allocation findings are reproducible and have theoretical implications for understanding inequity aversion and group status effects on resource allocation decisions in young children.

We propose a novel approach combining reverse-Bayes analysis with Bayesian hypothesis testing: a sceptical prior is determined for the effect size such that the original finding is no longer convincing in terms of a Bayes factor. This prior is then contrasted to an advocacy prior (the reference posterior of the effect size based on the original study), and replication success is declared if the replication data favour the advocacy over the sceptical prior at a higher level than the original data favoured the sceptical prior over the null hypothesis. The sceptical Bayes factor is the highest level where replication success can be declared. A comparison to existing methods reveals that the sceptical Bayes factor combines several notions of replicability: it ensures that both studies show sufficient evidence against the null and penalises incompatibility of their effect estimates. Analysis of asymptotic properties and error rates, as well as case studies from the Social Sciences Replication Project show the advantages of the method for the assessment of replicability.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=1998444&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pak, Natalie S.</author><author>Peredo, Tatiana Nogueira</author><author>Madero Ucero, Ana Paula</author><author>Kaiser, Ann P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emt en espaÃ±ol para autismo: A collaborative communication intervention approach and single case design pilot study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders</abbr-1></periodical><keywords><keyword>Autism</keyword><keyword>Autism Spectrum Disorders</keyword><keyword>Caregivers</keyword><keyword>Communication Skills Training</keyword><keyword>Early language intervention</keyword><keyword>Intervention</keyword><keyword>Oral Communication</keyword><keyword>Single case</keyword><keyword>Spanish</keyword><keyword>Therapeutic Alliance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024-04-13</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0162-3257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10803-024-06322-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The primary purpose of the current pilot study was to test the effects of an adapted and collaborative intervention model with a systematic teaching approach on Latina Spanish-speaking caregiversâ use of EMT en EspaÃ±ol Para Autismo strategies with their young children on the autism spectrum. A multiple baseline across behaviors single case design was replicated across two dyads. A series of family interviews and a direct therapist-child intervention phase supported individualization of the intervention. Families were provided speech generating devices as part of their childrenâs intervention protocol. Caregivers were taught to use EMT en EspaÃ±ol Para Autismo strategies with aided language input. Strategies included contingent target-level and proximal target-level language modeling, linguistic expansions, and communication elicitations. Secondary variables measured included generalization of strategy use to unsupported interactions and at a 2-month follow-up, child communication outcomes, and social validity. There was a strong functional relation for one dyad between the adapted and collaborative intervention and caregiver use of EMT strategies. The functional relation was weakened by behavioral covariation for the other dyad. Children increased the quantity and diversity of their communication during the study. Caregivers generalized their use of most EMT strategies and reported most aspects of the approach to be socially valid. The current study provides an initial demonstration of an effective model for adaptation and individualization of naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions for Latino Spanish-speaking families with children on the autism spectrum.

Although there is strong empirical support for teaching clients to slow their respiration rate (RR) to the adult RF range between 4.5 and 6.5 bpm (Lehrer &amp; Gevirtz, 2014), there have been no definitive findings regarding the best inhalation-to-exhalation (IE) ratio to increase HRV when breathing within this range. Three methodological challenges have frustrated previous studies: ensuring participants breathed at the target RR, IE ratio, and the same RR during each IE ratio. The reviewed studies disagreed regarding the effect of IE ratios. Three studies found no IE ratio effect (Cappo &amp; Holmes in J Psychosom Res 28:265-273, 1984; Edmonds et al. in Biofeedback 37:141-146, 2009; Klintworth et al. in Physiol Meas 33:1717-1731, 2012). One reported an advantage for equal inhalations and exhalations (Lin et al. in Int J Psychophysiol 91:206?211, 2014). Four studies observed an advantage for longer exhalations than inhalations (Bae et al. in Psychophysiology 58:e13905, 2021; Laborde et al. in Sustainability 13:7775, 2021; Strauss-Blasche et al. in Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol 27:601?60, 2000; Van Diest et al. in Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback 39:171?180, 2014). One study reported an advantage for longer inhalations than exhalations (Paprika et al. in Acta Physiol Hung 101:273?281, 2014). We conducted original (N = 26) and replication (N = 16) studies to determine whether a 1:2 IE ratio produces different HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, or nonlinear metrics than a 1:1 ratio when breathing at 6 bpm. Our original study found that IE ratio did not affect HRV time- and frequency-domain metrics. The replication study confirmed these results and found no effect on HRV nonlinear measurements.

Here, we report seven preregistered online experiments conducted with volunteer U.S. participants (N = 6,953) that sought to replicate and probe the boundary conditions of this finding. Contrary to expectations, we found no shift in implicit racial evaluations in two close replication attempts (Experiments 1â2). Experiments 3â4 ruled out the possibility of insufficiently strong exemplar valence and subtyping as explanations for the failures to replicate. In Experiment 5, implicit racial evaluations did exhibit malleability in response to two different procedures relying on repeated evaluative pairings and evaluative statements, suggesting that they are capable of change. With insight from these studies, Experiments 6â7 were mounted with modifications to the Dasgupta and Greenwald (2001) procedure. Significant reductions in implicit pro-White/anti-Black evaluations were now observed when race, valence, and the contingency between the two were highlighted. In addition, across all experiments, the magnitude of shift in implicit racial evaluations was significantly predicted by participantsâ ability to recall the Blackâpositive and Whiteânegative contingencies experienced during the exemplar exposure task. Together, these data suggest that exposure to counterattitudinal exemplars can shift implicit racial evaluations toward neutrality, but such malleability strongly depends on contingency awareness. We discuss implications for social cognitive theory, theoretically informed debiasing interventions, and different paths toward resolving initial replication failures.

The approach combines a specific reverse Bayes technique with prior-predictive tail probabilities to define replication success. The method gives rise to a quantitative measure for replication success, called the sceptical p-value. The sceptical p-value integrates traditional significance of both the original and the replication study with a comparison of the respective effect sizes. It incorporates the uncertainty of both the original and the replication effect estimates and reduces to the ordinary p-value of the replication study if the uncertainty of the original effect estimate is ignored. The framework proposed can also be used to determine the power or the required replication sample size to achieve replication success. Numerical calculations highlight the difficulty of achieving replication success if the evidence from the original study is only suggestive. An application to data from the Open Science Collaboration project on the replicability of psychological science illustrates the methodology proposed.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=1855590&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ren, Qidong</author><author>Guo, Xuejun</author><author>Yang, Dong</author><author>Zhao, Chuanfang</author><author>Zhang, Xiangyuan</author><author>Xia, Xinghui</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A wide survey of heavy metals-induced in-vitro DNA replication stress characterized by rate-limited replication.</title><secondary-title>Current research in toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current research in toxicology</full-title><abbr-1>Current research in toxicology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>100152</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>DNA replication rate</keyword><keyword>DNA replication stress</keyword><keyword>DNA replication-related disease</keyword><keyword>Heavy metal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024-02-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2666-027X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.crtox.2024.100152</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Heavy metals (HMs) are environmental pollutants that pose a threat to human health and have been accepted to cause various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. DNA replication stress has been identified to be associated with such diseases. However, the effect of HMs exclusively on DNA replication stress is still not well understood. In this study, DNA replication stress induced by thirteen HMs was assessed using a simplified in-vitro DNA replication model. Two parameters, Ct e /Ct c          reflecting the cycle threshold value alteration and K e /K c          reflecting the linear phase slope change, were calculated based on the DNA replication amplification curve to evaluate the rate of exponential and linear phases. These parameters were used to detect the replication rate reflecting in-vitro DNA replication stress induced by tested HMs. According to the effective concentrations and rate-limiting degree, HMs were ranked as follows: Hg, CeÂ &gt;Â PbÂ &gt;Â ZnÂ &gt;Â CrÂ &gt;Â CdÂ &gt;Â CoÂ &gt;Â FeÂ &gt;Â Mn, Cu, Bi, Sr, Ni. Additionally, EDTA could relieve the DNA replication stress induced by some HMs. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential danger of HMs themselves on DNA replication and provides new insight into the possible links between HMs and DNA replication-related diseases.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In conceiving VIS4ML systems, researchers characterize the nature of human knowledge to support human-in-the-loop tasks, design interactive visualizations to make ML components interpretable and elicit knowledge, and evaluate the effectiveness of human-model interchange. We survey recent VIS4ML papers to assess the generalizability of research contributions and claims in enabling human-in-the-loop ML. Our results show potential gaps between the current scope of VIS4ML research and aspirations for its use in practice. We find that while papers motivate that VIS4ML systems are applicable beyond the specific conditions studied, conclusions are often overfitted to non-representative scenarios, are based on interactions with a small set of ML experts and well-understood datasets, fail to acknowledge crucial dependencies, and hinge on decisions that lack justification. We discuss approaches to close the gap between aspirations and research claims and suggest documentation practices to report generality constraints that better acknowledge the exploratory nature of VIS4ML research.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=37871059&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bell, Suzanne O.</author><author>Guiella, Georges</author><author>Anjur-Dietrich, Selena</author><author>Bazie, Fiacre</author><author>Onadja, Yentema</author><author>Ahmed, Saifuddin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social Network-Based Induced Abortion Incidence Estimation in Burkina Faso: Examining the Impact of the Network Generating Question</title><secondary-title>Studies in Family Planning</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studies in Family Planning</full-title><abbr-1>Studies in Family Planning</abbr-1></periodical><pages>639-655</pages><volume>53</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Analysis of Health Care Markets I11</keyword><keyword>Child Care</keyword><keyword>Children</keyword><keyword>Economic Anthropology</keyword><keyword>Economic Development: Human Resources</keyword><keyword>Economic Sociology</keyword><keyword>Economics of Gender</keyword><keyword>Family Planning</keyword><keyword>Fertility</keyword><keyword>Human Development</keyword><keyword>Income Distribution</keyword><keyword>Language</keyword><keyword>Migration O15</keyword><keyword>Non-labor Discrimination J16</keyword><keyword>Social and Economic Stratification Z13</keyword><keyword>Youth J13</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00393665</isbn><abstract>Social network-based methods are increasingly used to estimate induced abortion incidence and investigate correlates. Approaches differ in the social tie definitions used to identify which social network members' abortion experiences respondents will report. This study compares the effect of using the "best friend" (closest female friend) versus "confidante" (specifying mutual sharing of personal information) definition on abortion incidence estimation. We use data from a nationally representative survey of women aged 15-49 in Burkina Faso (conducted in 2020-2021) where respondents were randomized into two versions of an abortion module, using different friend definitions. We computed abortion rate estimates by friend definition and adjusted for assumption violations (transmission bias, surrogate sample selection bias). Unadjusted incidence rates varied from 11.7 [4.1-19.2] abortions per 1,000 women to 15.6 [9.7-21.4], depending on friend definition. The confidante definition yielded higher adjusted estimates (36.2 [25.1-47.2]) than the best friend definition (17.0 [8.7-25.3]) due to greater transmission bias adjustment. Both estimates exceeded the respondent self-reported abortion incidence (4.0 [2.2-5.9]). Our results indicate that either friend definition produces higher incidence estimates than self-report but suggest a potential advantage for the "best friend" over the "confidante" definition given lower transmission bias. Further research should assess generalizability of these findings in other contexts.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=2022806&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chapelle, CÃ©line</author><author>Le Teuff, GwÃ©naÃ«l</author><author>Zufferey, Paul Jacques</author><author>Laporte, Silvy</author><author>Ollier, Edouard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A framework to characterise the reproducibility of metaâanalysis results with its application to direct oral anticoagulants in the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism</title><secondary-title>Research Synthesis Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research Synthesis Methods</full-title><abbr-1>Research Synthesis Methods</abbr-1></periodical><pages>117-129</pages><volume>15</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aggregate data</keyword><keyword>Bayesian analysis</keyword><keyword>bivariate mixed effect model</keyword><keyword>Drug Therapy</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword><keyword>reproducibility</keyword><keyword>Thromboses</keyword><keyword>vibration of effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1759-2879</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jrsm.1676</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The number of metaâanalyses of aggregate data has dramatically increased due to the facility of obtaining data from publications and the development of free, easyâtoâuse, and specialised statistical software. Even when metaâanalyses include the same studies, their results may vary owing to different methodological choices. Assessment of the replication of metaâanalysis provides an example of the variation of effect ânaturallyâ observed between multiple research projects. Reproducibility of results has mostly been reported using graphical descriptive representations. A quantitative analysis of such results would enable (i) breakdown of the total observed variability with quantification of the variability generated by the replication process and (ii) identification of which variables account for this variability, such as methodological quality or the statistical analysis procedures used. These variables might explain systematic mean differences between results and dispersion of the results. To quantitatively characterise the reproducibility of metaâanalysis results, a bivariate linear mixedâeffects model was developed to simulate both mean results and their corresponding uncertainty. Results were assigned to several replication groups, those assessing the same studies, outcomes, treatment indication and comparisons classified in the same replication group. A nested random effect structure was used to break down the total variability within each replication group and between these groups to enable calculation of an intragroup correlation coefficient and quantification of reproducibility. Determinants of variability were investigated by modelling both mean and variance parameters using covariates. The proposed model was applied to the example of metaâanalyses evaluating direct oral anticoagulants in the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Recent studies also suggest that the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity (dFC) can be altered in these disorders. Here, we summarized the existing literature on dFC in SCZ and BD, and their association with psychopathological and cognitive features. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies investigating dFC in SCZ and BD and identified 77 studies. Our findings support a general model of dysconnectivity of dFC in SCZ, whereas a heterogeneous picture arose in BD. Although dFC alterations are more severe and widespread in SCZ compared to BD, dysfunctions of a triple network system underlying goal-directed behavior and sensory-motor networks were present in both disorders. Furthermore, in SCZ, positive and negative symptoms were associated with abnormal dFC. Implications for understanding the pathophysiology of disorders, the role of neurotransmitters, and treatments on dFC are discussed. The lack of standards for dFC metrics, replication studies, and the use of small samples represent major limitations for the field.

Few replication attempts have been conducted in studies of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and the best method for determining whether a finding replicates has not been explored. The goal of the current study was to conduct direct replications within a multisite AUD-randomized controlled trial and to test a range of replication metrics. Method: We used data from a large AUD clinical trial (Project Matching Alcoholism Treatments and Client Heterogeneity [Project MATCH], n = 1,726) to simulate direct replication attempts. We examined associations between drinking intensity and negative alcohol-related consequences (Model 1), sex differences in drinking intensity (Model 2), and reductions in drinking following treatment (Model 3). We treated each of the 11 data collection sites as unique studies such that each subsample was treated as an 'original' study, and the remaining 10 subsamples were viewed as 'replication' studies. Replicability metrics included the consistency of statistical significance, overlapping confidence intervals, and consistency of the direction of the effect. We also tested effect replication and heterogeneity using meta-analysis. Results: We observed between 0% and 100% replicability across the replicability metrics depending on which subsample was treated as the 'original' study. Meta-analyses indicated results were more similar across subsamples with no significant heterogeneity for Models 1 and 2. Conclusions: We recommend researchers focus on effect sizes and use meta-analysis to evaluate the level of replicability. We also encourage direct replication attempts and sharing of data and code to facilitate direct replication.

The reported proportion of findings that these programs determined failed to replicate have become important statistics in the replication crisis. However, these 'failure rates' are based on decisions about whether individual studies replicated, which are themselves subject to statistical uncertainty. In this article, we examine how that uncertainty impacts the accuracy of reported failure rates and find that the reported failure rates can be substantially biased and highly variable. Indeed, very high or very low failure rates could arise from chance alone.

Some evaluations conduct only a single replication study while others run several, usually across multiple laboratories. Designing such programs has largely contended with difficult issues about which experimental components are necessary for a set of studies to be considered replications. However, another important consideration is that replication studies be designed to support sufficiently sensitive analyses. For instance, if hypothesis tests are to be conducted about replication, studies should be designed to ensure these tests are well-powered; if not, it can be difficult to determine conclusively if replication attempts succeeded or failed. This paper describes methods for designing ensembles of replication studies to ensure that they are both adequately sensitive and cost-efficient. It describes two potential analyses of replication studies--hypothesis tests and variance component estimation--and approaches to obtaining optimal designs for them. Using these results, it assesses the statistical power, precision of point estimators and optimality of the design used by the Many Labs Project and finds that while it may have been sufficiently powered to detect some larger differences between studies, other designs would have been less costly and/or produced more precise estimates or higher-powered hypothesis tests.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=2021326&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nosek, Brian A.</author><author>Hardwicke, Tom E.</author><author>Moshontz, Hannah</author><author>Allard, AurÃ©lien</author><author>Corker, Katherine S.</author><author>Dreber, Anna</author><author>Fidler, Fiona</author><author>Hilgard, Joe</author><author>Struhl, Melissa Kline</author><author>Nuijten, MichÃ¨le B.</author><author>Rohrer, Julia M.</author><author>Romero, Felipe</author><author>Scheel, Anne M.</author><author>Scherer, Laura D.</author><author>SchÃ¶nbrodt, Felix D.</author><author>Vazire, Simine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replicability, robustness, and reproducibility in psychological science</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Psychology</full-title><abbr-1>Annual Review of Psychology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>719-748</pages><volume>73</volume><keywords><keyword>Awareness</keyword><keyword>Behavioral Sciences</keyword><keyword>Experimental Replication</keyword><keyword>generalizability</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Innovation</keyword><keyword>metascience</keyword><keyword>Methodology</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword><keyword>reproducibility</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Research Design</keyword><keyword>research methods</keyword><keyword>robustness</keyword><keyword>Social Psychology</keyword><keyword>statistical inference</keyword><keyword>Statistical Inference</keyword><keyword>Statistical Validity</keyword><keyword>theory</keyword><keyword>validity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0066-4308</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-psych-020821-114157</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replicationâan important, uncommon, and misunderstood practiceâis gaining appreciation in psychology. Achieving replicability is important for making research progress. If findings are not replicable, then prediction and theory development are stifled. If findings are replicable, then interrogation of their meaning and validity can advance knowledge. Assessing replicability can be productive for generating and testing hypotheses by actively confronting current understandings to identify weaknesses and spur innovation. For psychology, the 2010s might be characterized as a decade of active confrontation. Systematic and multi-site replication projects assessed current understandings and observed surprising failures to replicate many published findings. Replication efforts highlighted sociocultural challenges such as disincentives to conduct replications and a tendency to frame replication as a personal attack rather than a healthy scientific practice, and they raised awareness that replication contributes to self-correction. Nevertheless, innovation in doing and understanding replication and its cousins, reproducibility and robustness, has positioned psychology to improve research practices and accelerate progress.

An additional advantage of the use of this Bayesian approach is that combining the results from multiple studies is straightforward. In this article, we discuss the behavior of Bayes factors in the context of evaluating informative hypotheses with multiple studies. By using simple models and (partly) analytical solutions, we introduce and evaluate Bayesian evidence synthesis (BES) and compare its results to Bayesian sequential updating. By doing so, we clarify how different replications or updating questions can be evaluated. In addition, we illustrate BES with two simulations, in which multiple studies are generated to resemble conceptual replications. The studies in these simulations are too heterogeneous to be aggregated with conventional research synthesis methods.

Here, we aim to reproduce, replicate, and extend the previous findings using data from the later ABCD study 4.0 release, which includes a significantly larger sample. Methods To reproduce and replicate the previous authorsâ findings, we analyzed data from the ABCD 1.0 release (n = 2437), from an independent subsample from the newer ABCD 4.0 release (excluding individuals from the 1.0 release) (n = 6456), and from the full ABCD 4.0 release sample (n = 8866). Additionally, we assessed whether using a multiple linear regression approach could improve replicability by controlling for the effects of comorbid psychiatric conditions and sociodemographic covariates. Results While the previously reported associations were reproducible, effect sizes for most rsfMRI measures were drastically reduced in replication analyses (including for both t-tests and multiple linear regressions) using the ABCD 4.0 (excluding 1.0) sample. However, 2 new rsfMRI measures (the Auditory vs. Right Putamen and the Retrosplenial-Temporal vs. Right-Thalamus-Proper measures) exhibited replicable associations with anhedonia and stable, albeit small, effect sizes across the ABCD samples, even after accounting for sociodemographic covariates and comorbid psychiatric conditions using a multiple linear regression approach. Conclusion The most statistically significant associations between anhedonia and rsfMRI connectivity measures found in the ABCD 1.0 sample tended to be non-replicable and inflated. Contrastingly, replicable associations exhibited smaller effects with less statistical significance in the ABCD 1.0 sample. Multiple linear regressions helped assess the specificity of these findings and control the effects of confounding covariates.

Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation (5mC), have been associated with AUD and other alcohol-related traits. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have identified differentially methylated genes associated with AUD in human peripheral and brain tissue. More recently, epigenetic studies of AUD have also evaluated DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) in the human brain. However, most of the epigenetic work in postmortem brain tissue has examined bulk tissue. In this study, we investigated neuronal-specific 5mC and 5hmC alterations at CpG sites associated with AUD in the human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Neuronal nuclei from the OFC were evaluated in 34 human postmortem brain samples (10 AUD, 24 non-AUD). Reduced representation oxidative bisulfite sequencing was used to assess 5mC and 5hmC at the genome-wide level. Differential 5mC and 5hmC were evaluated using the methylKit R package and significance was set at false discovery rate &lt;0.05 and differential methylation &gt;2. Functional enrichment analyses were performed and replication was evaluated replication in an independent dataset that assessed 5mC and 5hmC of AUD in bulk cortical tissue. We identified 417 5mC and 363 5hmC genome-wide significant differential CpG sites associated with AUD, with 59% in gene promoters. We also identified genes previously implicated in alcohol consumption, such as SYK , CHRM2 , DNMT3A , and GATA4 , for 5mC and GATA4 , and GAD1 , GATA4 , DLX1 for 5hmC. Replication was observed for 28 CpG sites from a previous AUD 5mC and 5hmC study, including FOXP1 . Lastly, GWAS enrichment analysis showed an association with AUD for differential 5mC genes. This study reveals neuronal-specific methylome and hydroxymethylome dysregulation associated with AUD. We replicated previous findings and identified novel associations with AUD for both 5mC and 5hmC marks within the OFC. Our findings provide new insights into the epigenomic dysregulation of AUD in the human brain.; Competing Interests: 8Conflict of Interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=38105948&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sotola, Lukas K.</author><author>CredÃ©, Marcus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the predicted replicability of two decades of experimental research on system justification: A zâcurve analysis</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Social Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Social Psychology</full-title><abbr-1>European Journal of Social Psychology</abbr-1></periodical><keywords><keyword>No terms assigned</keyword><keyword>open science</keyword><keyword>publication bias</keyword><keyword>replicability</keyword><keyword>statistical power</keyword><keyword>system justification theory</keyword><keyword>zâcurve</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-09-24</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0046-2772</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ejsp.2858</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We examine the predicted replicability of experimental research on system justification theory (SJT) by conducting a zâcurve analysis. Zâcurve is a metaâanalytic technique similar to pâcurve, but which performs better under conditions of heterogeneity. It estimates the predicted replication rate, average power, false discovery risk, and file drawer ratio (FDR) of a sample of studies. The zâcurve based on 116 papers and 232 unique samples suggests that the experimental SJT literature is likely to show low rates of replicability, as indicated by an overall average statistical power of 16%. Moderator analyses suggest that this may be driven in part by publication pressures, that the replicability of research in this area has improved since 2015, and that studies using system threat manipulations show particularly low estimated replication rates (ERR). Implications for the replicability and validity of the experimental SJT literature are discussed, and recommendations to increase the rigor of research are put forth.

A reproducible study is one where the results can be recreated by using the same methodology and materials as the original researchers. Unfortunately, reproducibility is not a standard to which the majority of research is currently adherent.; Methods: Our cross-sectional survey evaluated 300 trials in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Our primary objective was to identify nine indicators of reproducibility and transparency. These indicators include availability of data, analysis scripts, pre-registration information, study protocols, funding source, conflict of interest statements and whether or not the study was available via Open Access.; Results: Of the 300 trials in our sample, 208 contained empirical data that could be assessed for reproducibility. None of the trials in our sample provided a link to their protocols or provided a statement on availability of materials. None were replication studies. Just 10.58% provided a statement regarding their data availability, while only 5.82% provided a statement on preregistration. 25.85% failed to report the presence or absence of conflicts of interest and 54.08% did not state the origin of their funding.; Conclusion: In the studies we examined, research in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology is not consistently reproducible and frequently lacks conflict of interest disclosure. Consequences of this could be far-reaching and include increased research waste, widespread acceptance of misleading results and erroneous conclusions guiding clinical decision-making.; Competing Interests: Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Due to their low opportunity costs and high availability, university students are frequently recruited as the study population. Even though they are rather untypical with regard to many characteristics (e.g., age and income) compared to the representatives of the social group of interest, the experimental behaviours of students are sometimes prematurely generalised to other social groups or even to humans in general. Given the widespread challenges in the agricultural and environmental sector, it is particularly interesting to address farmers' decision-making. We analyse whether agricultural students can be used to approximate the behaviour of farmers in simple economic experiments, which are often used to measure risk aversion, impatience, positive reciprocity, negative reciprocity, altruism and trust. Moreover, we consider the role of systematically varied monetary incentives. We find no differences between agricultural students and farmers in their risk aversion; farmers' positive reciprocity and trust are positively associated with the incentive level, which cannot be observed with agricultural students. Findings regarding altruism in the two populations are mixed and challenge the finding of earlier studies of students being less pro-social. Agricultural students are a lower boundary of impatience and negative reciprocity. These heterogeneous results suggest that scientific inference from agricultural students to farmers should be made cautiously. However, we do not deal with a representative sample of our target population (e.g., gender). Replication studies are required to evaluate the generalisability of our findings.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=2020423&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Elliott, Sean</author><author>GouriÃ©roux, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimated reproduction ratios in the SIR model.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian journal of statistics = Revue canadienne de statistique</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian journal of statistics = Revue canadienne de statistique</full-title><abbr-1>The Canadian journal of statistics = Revue canadienne de statistique</abbr-1></periodical><pages>992-1017</pages><volume>49</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Approximate maximum likelihood</keyword><keyword>COVIDâ19</keyword><keyword>EpiEstim</keyword><keyword>final size</keyword><keyword>reproduction ratio</keyword><keyword>SIR model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0319-5724</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/cjs.11663</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this article is to understand the extreme variability in estimates of the reproduction ratio R         0 observed in practice.

Here, we propose that overgeneralizing alcohol-related associations characterizes risky drinking. We conducted two online experiments assessing generalization of alcohol-related gains (Study 1) and losses (Study 2) among individuals who engaged in light or risky patterns of drinking (Study 1: N = 88, 24â44 years old; Study 2: N = 87, 21â44 years old). After learning to associate cards with alcohol and non-alcohol-related outcomes, participants chose whether to play with cards varying in perceptual similarity to those shown during conditioning. Finally, participants completed a surprise recognition memory test for all outcomes. Although both groups showed comparable conditioning, we found that risky drinkers overgeneralized alcohol-related gains and losses. Risky drinkers also showed a bias toward recognizing alcohol-related images. These results indicate a novel role for overgeneralization of alcohol-related gains and losses as a mechanism associated with risky drinking.

Here, we investigated how individual differences in threat responsiveness modulated adjustments in negative affect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 441) underwent a fear conditioning and generalization experiment between 2013 and 2020 and were reassessed regarding anxiety and depression symptoms after the pandemic outbreak. Participants showed increased levels of negative affect following pandemic onset, which were partly modulated by laboratory measures of threat responsiveness. Decreased differentiation of threat and safety signals in participants with higher prepandemic depression and anxiety scores in the laboratory assessment were most predictive of increased symptom levels after the onset of the pandemic. However, effects were small and should be replicated in independent samples to further characterize how individual differences in threat processing interact with adverse experiences in the development of psychopathology.

Flow is operationally defined in relation to the boundary conditions of boredom and overload. According to the conditionsâ arrangement, two major neural flow effects are of interest, inferred by quadratic trends of neural activation. The inverted U-shaped pattern of neural activation is characterized by greater neural activation during the flow condition relative to boredom and overload, while the U-shaped pattern is the reverse, that is, lower neural activation during flow relative to its boundary conditions. Both effects have repeatedly been reported during the last years and have seen greater scientific resonance, which is why we found it necessary to try to replicate recent findings. A fresh sample of 41 healthy male participants was investigated with BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with our flow paradigm. Electrodermal activation served as read-out of the flow effect on the psychophysiological level. Evidence of replication was quantified in terms of the replication Bayes factor. We observed strong replication evidence for electrodermal activation and decisive evidence of replication for both neural flow effects. Aspects of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula and parietal cortex showed inverted U-shaped activation. U-shaped activation was predominant in aspects of medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, amygdala and along the cingulate cortex (subgenual, middle and posterior). Despite its strong replicability, the flow paradigm has been administered in men-only samples so far. Therefore, present results still await empirical replication in women-only samples.

This study aimed at evaluating the potential of Cu dysregulation as an AD susceptibility factor. We performed a meta-analysis of 56 studies investigating Cu biomarkers in brain specimens (pooled total of 182 AD and 166 healthy controls, HC) and in serum/plasma (pooled total of 2929 AD and 3547 HC). We also completed a replication study of serum Cu biomarkers in 97 AD patients and 70 HC screened for rs732774 and rs1061472 ATP7B , the gene encoding for the Cu transporter ATPase7B. Our meta-analysis showed decreased Cu in AD brain specimens, increased Cu and nonbound ceruloplasmin (Non-Cp) Cu in serum/plasma samples, and unchanged ceruloplasmin. Serum/plasma Cu excess was associated with a three to fourfold increase in the risk of having AD. Our replication study confirmed meta-analysis results and showed that carriers of the ATP7B AG haplotype were significantly more frequent in the AD group. Overall, our study shows that AD patients fail to maintain a Cu metabolic balance and reveals the presence of a percentage of AD patients carrying ATP7B AG haplotype and presenting Non-Cp Cu excess, which suggest that a subset of AD subjects is prone to Cu imbalance. This AD subtype can be the target of precision medicine-based strategies tackling Cu dysregulation.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=34209820&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lane, Tyler J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Associations Between Firearm and Suicide Rates: A Replication of Kleck (2021).</title><secondary-title>Archives of suicide research : official journal of the International Academy for Suicide Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Archives of suicide research : official journal of the International Academy for Suicide Research</full-title><abbr-1>Archives of suicide research : official journal of the International Academy for Suicide Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>880-895</pages><volume>27</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Cross-national</keyword><keyword>firearms</keyword><keyword>Firearms*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>open science</keyword><keyword>Ownership</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword><keyword>Suicide*</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1543-6136</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/13811118.2022.2083535</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: Using data from n â=â194 nation-states, Kleck found that firearm availability was only associated with firearm suicide rates, but not total or non-firearm suicides. He thus concluded that while firearm availability influences how people commit suicide, it does not affect total numbers. However, the study contains numerous logical and methodological issues and is at odds with the evidence base. Therefore, I attempt to reproduce the original results.; Method: I reproduce the original study's methods: ordinary least squares regression, weighted by the square root of the population, with log-transformed suicide rates and three separate firearm availability measures: global estimates from the Small Arms Survey , proportion of suicides committed with firearms, and a European Union survey of firearm ownership. I also test several methodological variations and include U.S. suicide data.; Results: In contrast to Kleck, global analyses with Small Arms Survey data found a significant and positive association between firearm availability and total suicides, as did U.S. analyses. Analyses with other firearm availability measures comported with the original study, finding no association.; Conclusion: The main result in Kleck failed to reproduce, finding instead a significant association between firearm availability and suicide rates, as did U.S. analyses. While reproductions of Kleck's other analyses continued to show no association, they were based on unreliable methods. I therefore reject Kleck's conclusion that that firearm availability does not influence suicide rates. HighlightsUsing data global data, I find firearm availability is positively associated with suicide rates.I identify serious flaws in the logic and methods of Kleck and an earlier review.For transparency, data and code have been archived on a public repository.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=35686601&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cobey, Kelly D</author><author>Fehlmann, Christophe A</author><author>Christ Franco, Marina</author><author>Ayala, Ana Patricia</author><author>Sikora, Lindsey</author><author>Rice, Danielle B</author><author>Xu, Chenchen</author><author>Ioannidis, John P A</author><author>Lalu, Manoj M</author><author>MÃ©nard, Alixe</author><author>Neitzel, Andrew</author><author>Nguyen, Bea</author><author>Tsertsvadze, Nino</author><author>Moher, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological characteristics and prevalence rates of research reproducibility across disciplines: A scoping review of articles published in 2018-2019.</title><secondary-title>ELife</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ELife</full-title><abbr-1>ELife</abbr-1></periodical><volume>12</volume><keywords><keyword>medicine</keyword><keyword>meta-research</keyword><keyword>none</keyword><keyword>open science</keyword><keyword>Prevalence*</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword><keyword>reproducibility</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-06-21</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2050-084X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.7554/eLife.78518</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Reproducibility is a central tenant of research. We aimed to synthesize the literature on reproducibility and describe its epidemiological characteristics, including how reproducibility is defined and assessed. We also aimed to determine and compare estimates for reproducibility across different fields.; Methods: We conducted a scoping review to identify English language replication studies published between 2018 and 2019 in economics, education, psychology, health sciences, and biomedicine. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature - CINAHL, Education Source via EBSCOHost, ERIC, EconPapers, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), and EconLit. Documents retrieved were screened in duplicate against our inclusion criteria. We extracted year of publication, number of authors, country of affiliation of the corresponding author, and whether the study was funded. For the individual replication studies, we recorded whether a registered protocol for the replication study was used, whether there was contact between the reproducing team and the original authors, what study design was used, and what the primary outcome was. Finally, we recorded how reproducibilty was defined by the authors, and whether the assessed study(ies) successfully reproduced based on this definition. Extraction was done by a single reviewer and quality controlled by a second reviewer.; Results: Our search identified 11,224 unique documents, of which 47 were included in this review. Most studies were related to either psychology (48.6%) or health sciences (23.7%). Among these 47 documents, 36 described a single reproducibility study while the remaining 11 reported at least two reproducibility studies in the same paper. Less than the half of the studies referred to a registered protocol. There was variability in the definitions of reproduciblity success. In total, across the 47 documents 177 studies were reported. Based on the definition used by the author of each study, 95 of 177 (53.7%) studies reproduced.; Conclusions: This study gives an overview of research across five disciplines that explicitly set out to reproduce previous research. Such reproducibility studies are extremely scarce, the definition of a successfully reproduced study is ambiguous, and the reproducibility rate is overall modest.; Funding: No external funding was received for this work.; Competing Interests: KC, CF, MC, AA, LS, DR, CX, JI, ML, AM, AN, BN, NT, DM No competing interests declared (Â© 2023, Cobey et al.)</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=37341380&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Yongtian</author><author>Li, Johnson Ching-Hong</author><author>Liu, Xiyao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Limited usefulness of capture procedure and capture percentage for evaluating reproducibility in psychological science</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Psychology</full-title><abbr-1>Frontiers in Psychology</abbr-1></periodical><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>capture percentage</keyword><keyword>capture procedure</keyword><keyword>effect sizes</keyword><keyword>Experimental Replication</keyword><keyword>Psychology</keyword><keyword>reproducibility</keyword><keyword>simulation</keyword><keyword>Simulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-09-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1664-1078</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01657</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In psychological science, there is an increasing concern regarding the reproducibility of scientific findings. For instance, Replication Project: Psychology (Open Science Collaboration, 2015) found that the proportion of successful replication in psychology was 41%. This proportion was calculated based on Cumming and Maillardet (2006) widely employed capture procedure (CPro) and capture percentage (CPer). Despite the popularity of CPro and CPer, we believe that using them may lead to an incorrect conclusion of (a) successful replication when the population effect sizes in the original and replicated studies are different; and (b) unsuccessful replication when the population effect sizes in the original and replicated studies are identical but their sample sizes are different. Our simulation results show that the performances of CPro and CPer become biased, such that researchers can easily make a wrong conclusion of successful/unsuccessful replication. Implications of these findings are considered in the conclusion.

Here, we focus on visual stimuliâstimuli routinely used to elicit mental processes and behaviorsâas a case study to systematically assess and evaluate current practices in reporting visual characteristics, including display setup, stimulus size, luminance/color, and contrast. Our first study scrutinized recent publications (N = 360) in leading journals in neuroscience and psychologyâspanning vision, cognitive, clinical, developmental, and social/personality psychology. The second study examined recent publications (N = 114) on visual attentional bias in clinical samples, involving tasks known to be sensitive to visual properties. Analyzing the full text and supplemental materials of these articles, the two studies reveal a systematic lapse in current practices of reporting characteristics of visual stimuli. This reporting failure was not due to authors making visual materials available online, which was rare (&lt;20%) and could not replace the reporting of visual characteristics. Failure to report stimulus properties hinders efforts to build cumulative science: (a) direct replications become challenging if not impossible; (b) internal validity may be compromised; and (c) generalizability across stimulus properties is prematurely assumed, and its evaluation is precluded in the first place. Our findings have immediate implications for journal policies on reporting practices, urging for explicit emphasis on transparent reporting of stimulus properties, particularly when perceptual components are involved. To assist in this effort, we provide templates for reporting study setup, visual displays, and visual stimuli.

We aimed to employ radiomics analysis after ComBat harmonization to predict early improvement to ADM in adolescents with MDD by using brain multiscale structural MRI (sMRI) and identify the radiomics features with high prediction power for selection of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Methods: 121 MDD patients were recruited for brain sMRI, including three-dimensional T1 weighted imaging (3D-T1WI)and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). After receiving SSRIs or SNRIs for 2 weeks, the subjects were divided into ADM improvers (SSRIs improvers and SNRIs improvers) and non-improvers according to reduction rate of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 17 item (HAM-Dââ) score. Then, sMRI data were preprocessed, and conventional imaging indicators and radiomics features of gray matter (GM) based on surface-based morphology (SBM) and voxel-based morphology (VBM) and diffusion properties of white matter (WM) were extracted and harmonized with ComBat harmonization. Two-level reduction strategy with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) was utilized sequentially to decrease high-dimensional features. Support vector machine with radial basis function kernel (RBF-SVM) was used to integrate multiscale sMRI features to construct models for early improvement prediction. Area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity based on the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were calculated to evaluate the model performance. Permutation tests were used for assessing the generalization rate. Results: After 2-week ADM, 121 patients were divided into 67 ADM improvers (31 SSRIs improvers and 36 SNRIs improvers) and 54 ADM non-improvers. After two-level dimensionality reduction, 8 conventional indicators (2 VBM-based features and 6 diffusion features) and 49 radiomics features (16 VBM-based features and 33 diffusion features) were selected. The overall accuracy of RBF-SVM models based on conventional indicators and radiomics features was 74.80% and 88.19%. The radiomics model achieved the AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.889, 91.2%, 80.1% and 85.1%, 0.954, 89.2%, 87.4% and 88.5%, 0.942, 91.9%, 82.5% and 86.8% for predicting ADM improvers, SSRIs improvers and SNRIs improvers, respectively. P value of permutation tests were less than 0.001. The radiomics features predicting ADM improver were mainly located in the hippocampus, medial orbitofrontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum (lobule vii-b), body of corpus callosum, etc. The radiomics features predicting SSRIs improver were primarily distributed in hippocampus, amygdala, inferior temporal gyrus, thalamus, cerebellum (lobule vi), fornix, cerebellar peduncle, etc. The radiomics features predicting SNRIs improver were primarily located in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, ventral striatum, corpus callosum, etc. Conclusions: These findings suggest the radiomics analysis based on brain multiscale sMRI after ComBat harmonization could effectively predict the early improvement of ADM in adolescent MDD patients with a high accuracy, which was superior to the model based on the conventional indicators. The radiomics features with high prediction power may help for the individual selection of SSRIs and SNRIs.

In this paper, the author assesses the robustness of the broken windows theory by testing the cross-norm effect in two high-powered field experiments and a meta-analysis. The first field experiment is conducted in Germany and Sweden. The second field experiment, conducted in Sweden, replicates the first while also testing salience as a potential moderator, using an internal meta-regression. Finally, the author conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate both the overall effect size of the cross-norm effect using a random effects meta-analysis and salience as a potential moderator, using a meta-regression. In the first experiment, the author assessed the replicability of both the same-norm effect and the cross-norm effect. In the second experiment, the purpose of assessing crossings with different baselines was to test the hypothesis that the cross-norm effect depends on salience. The meta-analysis aimed to synthesize results from field experiments on broken windows theoryâs cross-norm prediction, as well as to test both salience and cultural tightness as potential moderators. This study assessed the broken windows theory by testing the cross-norm effect in two high-powered replication experiments and a meta-analysis.

There is mixed evidence suggesting that training these abilities may improve aspects of driving performance. This preliminary study investigated the feasibility of training three-dimensional multiple object tracking (3D-MOT)âa dynamic, speeded tracking task soliciting selective, sustained and divided attention as well as speed of processingâto improve measures of simulated driving performance in older and younger adults. A sample of 20 young adults (23â33 years old) and 14 older adults (65â76 years old) were randomly assigned to either a 3D-MOT training group or an active control group trained on a perceptual discrimination task as well as 2048. Participants were tested on a driving scenario with skill-testing events previously identified as optimal for cross-sectional comparisons of driving ability. Results replicated previously identified differences in driving behaviour between age groups. A possible trend was observed for the 3D-MOT trained group, especially younger adults, to increase the distance at which they applied their maximum amount of braking in response to dangerous events. This measure was associated with less extreme braking during events, implying that these drivers may have been making more controlled stops. Limitations of sample size and task realism notwithstanding, the present experiment offers preliminary evidence that 3D-MOT training might transfer to driving performance through quicker detection of or reaction to dangerous events and provides a rationale for replication with a larger sample size.

Participants included 24,094 Kâ12 students who completed the mySAEBRS. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) supported the fit of a bifactor model, wherein each item corresponding to both a general factor (i.e., Total Behavior) and one of three narrow factors (i.e., Social Behavior, Academic Behavior, and Emotional Behavior). Such model fit was superior to that of alternative factor structures (i.e., unidimensional, correlated-factor, and higher order). A review of pattern coefficients suggested items were relatively split, with some items loading higher on the general factor and others loading higher on their narrow factor. A series of multigroup CFAs supported the configural and metric invariance of the bifactor model, while yielding less consistent support for scalar/threshold invariance. Omega reliability coefficients indicated each mySAEBRS scale was associated with acceptable internal consistency (&gt;.70). However, when accounting for other factors, only the Total Behavior, Social Behavior, and Emotional Behavior scales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (i.e., &gt;.50). Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.

The CERIS-A, developed to assess ethnic-racial identity attitudes in diverse ethnic and racial groups, has seven 4-item subscales: Assimilation, Miseducation, Self-Hatred, Anti-Dominant, Ethnocentricity, Multiculturalist Inclusive, and Ethnic-Racial Salience. Participants consisted of 250 young adults aged 18 to 29 (M = 22.4; 61.2% European American, 12.8% Asian American, 7.2% African American/Black, 5.6% Latinx, 3.2% other ethnic-racial groups, 10% unreported). CERIS-A scores were internally consistent (.76 to .94) and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the 7-factor model fit the data well. Comparisons with the studies in the extant literature showed that the psychometric properties of CERIS-A scores in the current study are comparable to those of scores on other instruments in the literature, and suggest that the CERIS-A is a potentially useful instrument for examining ethnic-racial identity attitudes across multiple ethnic-racial subgroups in the United States.

He thus concluded that while firearm availability influences how people commit suicide, it does not affect total numbers. However, the study contains numerous logical and methodological issues and is at odds with the evidence base. Therefore, I attempt to reproduce the original results. Method I reproduce the original studyâs methods: ordinary least squares regression, weighted by the square root of the population, with log-transformed suicide rates and three separate firearm availability measures: global estimates from the Small Arms Survey, proportion of suicides committed with firearms, and a European Union survey of firearm ownership. I also test several methodological variations and include U.S. suicide data. Results In contrast to Kleck, global analyses with Small Arms Survey data found a significant and positive association between firearm availability and total suicides, as did U.S. analyses. Analyses with other firearm availability measures comported with the original study, finding no association. Conclusion The main result in Kleck failed to reproduce, finding instead a significant association between firearm availability and suicide rates, as did U.S. analyses. While reproductions of Kleckâs other analyses continued to show no association, they were based on unreliable methods. I therefore reject Kleckâs conclusion that that firearm availability does not influence suicide rates. Highlights Using data global data, I find firearm availability is positively associated with suicide rates. I identify serious flaws in the logic and methods of Kleck and an earlier review. For transparency, data and code have been archived on a public repository.

Specific developments and proposals for assessing whether an effect has been replicated or not (or to what extent) are scarce, in the general context of behavioral sciences, and practically null in the singleâcase experimental designs context. We propose an extension of the modified Brinley plot for assessing how many of the effects replicate. To make this assessment possible, a definition of replication is suggested, on the basis of expert judgment, rather than on statistical criteria.

We examined CPD and NMR in a group of pregnant smokers, a quarter of whom were receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT).; Aims and Methods: Pregnant smokers recruited to participate in a placebo-controlled trial of bupropion for smoking cessation provided a blood sample for measurement of NMR.; Results: Half (52.4%) of the 124 women with NMR data were African American. OAT-treated women (n = 34, 27.4%; 27 receiving methadone and 7 buprenorphine) were more likely to be white (79% vs. 30%, p &lt; .001) and to have a lower mean PHQ-9 total score (2.91 [SD = 2.83] vs. 4.83 [SD = 3.82], p = .007). OAT-treated women reported smoking more CPD (9.50 [SD = 5.26] vs. 7.20 [SD = 3.65], p = .005) and had higher NMR (0.78 [SD = 0.36] vs. 0.56 [SD = 0.25], p = .001) than the non-OAT-treated group. In a linear regression analysis adjusting for race, depression severity, and CPD, NMR was greater in the OAT group (p = .025), among whom the daily methadone-equivalent dosage correlated with NMR (Spearman's Ï = 0.49, p = .003).; Conclusions: Consistent with the findings of Oncken et al. (2019), we found that OAT smokers smoked more and had higher NMR than non-OAT smokers. As higher NMR is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation, the effects on NMR of both pregnancy and OAT could contribute to a lower smoking cessation rate in pregnant smokers receiving chronic opioid therapy.; Implications: We replicated the finding that the NMR is significantly greater among pregnant smokers receiving OAT than those not receiving this treatment for opioid use disorder. Furthermore, we found that the dosage of the OAT was significantly associated with the NMR level. These findings may contribute to a poorer response to smoking cessation treatment in pregnant women treated with OAT, particularly those receiving high-dose therapy, and raise the question of whether novel approaches are needed to treat smoking in this subgroup of pregnant smokers.

Publicized failures to replicate landmark studies, along with high-profile cases of research fraud, have led scholars to reconsider the trustworthiness of both findings and institutionalized research practices. This paper considers two questions: (1) Relative to psychology and economics, what is the state of replication and reproduction research in management? (2) Are the disciplines equally advanced in the use of methods applied to study the replication problem? A systematic literature review identified 67 studies pertinent to these questions. The results indicate that the replication prevalence rate in management studies lies almost exactly between those of psychology and economics, while a high level of variation between management and other business-related disciplines can be noted. Further, similarly to psychology, but unlike economics, the surveys of published replications tend to report high replication success rates for management and other business-related disciplines. However, a comparison with recently obtained results in preregistered multi-study replications in psychology and economics suggests that these rates are almost certainly inflated. Method and data transparency are medium to low, often rendering attempts to reproduce or replicate studies impossible. Finally, the understanding of the replicability problem in management is held back by the underutilization of methods developed in other disciplines. The review also reveals that management, psychology, and economics exhibit strikingly different practices and approaches to replication, despite facing similar incentive structures. Disciplines in which replication and reproduction attempts are rare and which frequently involve authors of the original study in replication attempts lack strong deterrents against questionable research practices; thus, they are less likely to deliver replicable results.

Researchers examining virtual manipulative-based instructional sequences tend to focus on students documented with disabilities, as opposed to students at-risk or struggling with mathematics, as well as studentsâ acquisition of the target skill, despite students experiencing learning in four stages: acquisition, fluency, maintenance, and generalization. This study explored the virtual-representational-abstract (VRA) instructional sequence across four stages of learning for three elementary students struggling in mathematics. In the single-case design study, researchers found a functional relationship between the VRA instructional sequence delivered online via explicit instruction and studentsâ computational accuracy in their targeted area of mathematics need. Researchers also found limited influence on fluency rate or generalization to word problem accuracy but that students did maintain.

Specifically, it has been proposed that depressed individuals believe that negative events are more informative than positive events, resulting in higher learning rates from negative outcomes (Pulcu and Browning, 2019). In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as commonly used in depression treatment trials, might change learning rates for affective outcomes. Healthy adults completed an established reinforcement learning task (Pulcu and Browning, 2017) in which the information content of reward and loss outcomes was manipulated by varying the volatility of stimulus-outcome associations. Learning rates on the tasks were quantified using computational models. Stimulation over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) but not motor cortex (M1) increased learning rates specifically for reward outcomes. The effects of prefrontal tDCS were cognitive state-dependent: tDCS applied during task performance increased learning rates for wins; tDCS applied before task performance decreased both win and loss learning rates. A replication study confirmed the key finding that tDCS to DLPFC during task performance increased learning rates specifically for rewards. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential of tDCS for modulating computational parameters of reinforcement learning that are relevant to mood disorders.

Investigations into its neural underpinnings are required for improved management and treatment. Rodents are useful in investigating the neurobiology underlying atypical sustained attention and several rodent tasks have been developed for use in touchscreen testing platforms that mimic methodology used in human clinical attention assessment. This systematic review was conducted to assess how translatable these rodent tasks are to equivalent clinical human tasks. Studies using the rodent Continuous Performance Task (rCPT), Sustained Attention Task (SAT), and 5-choice CPT (5C-CPT) were sought and screened. Included in the review were 138 studies, using the rCPT (nâ=â21), SAT (nâ=â90), and 5C-CPT (nâ=â27). Translatability between rodent and human studies was assessed based on (1) methodological similarity, (2) performance similarity, and (3) replication of results. The 5C-CPT was found to be the most translatable cross-species paradigm with good utility, while the rCPT and SAT require adaptation and further development to meet these translatability benchmarks. With greater replication and more consistent results, greater confidence in the translation of sustained attention results between species will be engendered. (Â© 2024 The Authors.

We established guidelines for reproducible machine learning research using EEG and used these to assess the current state of reproducibility in mental workload modeling. We first started by summarizing the current state of reproducibility efforts in machine learning and in EEG. Next, we performed a systematic literature review on Scopus, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, and Pubmed databases to find studies about reproducibility in mental workload prediction using EEG. All of this previous work was used to formulate guidelines, which we structured along the widely recognized Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework. By using these guidelines, researchers can ensure transparency and comprehensiveness of their methodologies, therewith enhancing collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the scientific community, and enhancing the reliability, usability and significance of EEG and machine learning techniques in general. A second systematic literature review extracted machine learning studies that used EEG to estimate mental workload. We evaluated the reproducibility status of these studies using our guidelines. We highlight areas studied and overlooked and identify current challenges for reproducibility. Our main findings include limitations on reporting performance on unseen test data, open sharing of data and code, and reporting of resources essential for training and inference processes.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

The largest epizootic ever recorded in Europe was caused by HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses in the period 2021-2022. The recent H5-clade 2.3.4.4 viruses were found to differ in their virulence for chickens and ducks. Viruses causing only mild disease may remain undetected, increasing the risk of virus spread to other farms, wild birds and mammals. We developed in ovo models to determine the virulence of HPAI viruses for chickens and ducks, which are fast and have low costs. The virulence of five contemporary H5-viruses was compared studying replication rate, average time to death and virus spread in the embryo. Remarkable differences in virulence were observed between H5-viruses and between poultry species. The H5N1-2021 virus was found to have a fast replication rate in both the chicken and duck in ovo models, but a slower systemic virus dissemination compared to three other H5-clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. The results show the potential of in ovo models to quickly determine the virulence of novel HPAI viruses, and study potential virulence factors which can help to better guide the surveillance in poultry.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=38675905&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhen, Jianxin</author><author>Gu, Yuqin</author><author>Wang, Piao</author><author>Wang, Weihong</author><author>Bian, Shengzhe</author><author>Huang, Shujia</author><author>Liang, Hui</author><author>Huang, Mingxi</author><author>Yu, Yan</author><author>Chen, Qing</author><author>Jiang, Guozhi</author><author>Qiu, Xiu</author><author>Xiong, Likuan</author><author>Liu, Siyang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide association and Mendelian randomisation analysis among 30,699 Chinese pregnant women identifies novel genetic and molecular risk factors for gestational diabetes and glycaemic traits.</title><secondary-title>Diabetologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Diabetologia</full-title><abbr-1>Diabetologia</abbr-1></periodical><pages>703-713</pages><volume>67</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Blood Glucose/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2*/genetics</keyword><keyword>Diabetes, Gestational*</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic risk factors</keyword><keyword>Genome-wide association study</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Gestational diabetes</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mendelian randomisation</keyword><keyword>Molecular risk factors</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Pregnant Women</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-0428</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00125-023-06065-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aims/hypothesis: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common disorder in pregnancy; however, its underlying causes remain obscure. This study aimed to investigate the genetic and molecular risk factors contributing to GDM and glycaemic traits.; Methods: We collected non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) sequencing data along with four glycaemic and 55 biochemical measurements from 30,699 pregnant women during a 2 year period at Shenzhen Baoan Women's and Children's Hospital in China. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted between genotypes derived from NIPTs and GDM diagnosis, baseline glycaemic levels and glycaemic levels after glucose challenges. In total, 3317 women were diagnosed with GDM, while 19,565 served as control participants. The results were replicated using two independent cohorts. Additionally, we performed one-sample Mendelian randomisation to explore potential causal associations between the 55 biochemical measurements and risk of GDM and glycaemic levels.; Results: We identified four genetic loci significantly associated with GDM susceptibility. Among these, MTNR1B exhibited the highest significance (rs10830963-G, OR [95% CI] 1.57 [1.45, 1.70], p=4.42Ã10 -29 ), although its effect on type 2 diabetes was modest. Furthermore, we found 31 genetic loci, including 14 novel loci, that were significantly associated with the four glycaemic traits. The replication rates of these associations with GDM, fasting plasma glucose levels and 0 h, 1 h and 2 h OGTT glucose levels were 4 out of 4, 6 out of 9, 10 out of 11, 5 out of 7 and 4 out of 4, respectively. Mendelian randomisation analysis suggested that a genetically regulated higher lymphocytes percentage and lower white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage and absolute neutrophil count were associated with elevated glucose levels and an increased risk of GDM.; Conclusions/interpretation: Our findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of GDM and glycaemic traits during pregnancy in an East Asian population and highlight the potential role of inflammatory pathways in the aetiology of GDM and variations in glycaemic levels.; Data Availability: Summary statistics for GDM; fasting plasma glucose; 0 h, 1 h and 2h OGTT; and the 55 biomarkers are available in the GWAS Atlas (study accession no.: GVP000001, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gwas/browse/GVP000001) .

Accurate identification and quantification of key chemical constituents from botanical ingredients is necessary for consistent product preparations and reproducible research results. Manufacturers need quantitative reference materials of the chemical constituents of interest to verify the content of ingredients and products. The rigor and reproducibility of biomedical research is enhanced through thorough characterization of the interventions used in mechanistic, clinical, and safety investigations. Quantitative reference materials enable reliable product quality assessments and reproducible research results.; Objective: Solution-based certified reference material (CRM) mixes were developed as calibrants for phytochemicals in Ginger and Kava. The Kava CRM contained yangonin, desmethoxyyangonin, dihydrokavain, DL-kavain, methysticin, dihydromethysticin, flavokawain A, flavokawain B, and flavokawain C. The Ginger CRM contained 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, 6-shogaol, 8-shogaol, and 10-shogaol.; Methods: Each phytochemical was sourced as an isolated compound and assigned a purity factor by a mass balance approach accounting for residual impurities. The solution standard mixes were formulated by gravimetric addition of each phytochemical incorporating the purity factor and diluting with acetonitrile to the target concentrations of 500âÂµg/mL for the gingerols and shogaols, 250âÂµg/mL for the kavalactones and 25âÂµg/mL for the flavokawains.; Results: The concentration accuracy of each component in the solution mixes was analytically verified by HPLC-UV assay comparison to an independently prepared calibration solution. Each component in the Ginger and Kava CRMs were within 5% and 7% of the target concentrations, respectively.; Conclusions: Homogeneous Kava and Ginger phytochemical solution mixes were produced with accurate constituent concentrations and demonstrated good stability over two years. These solution mixes were launched as commercially available CRMs.; Highlights: These mixes can be used as accurate concentration stock solutions to prepare calibrators and controls for botanical dietary supplement product testing and standardization.

Since synthetic chemicals used to control these ticks can select resistant strains and cause toxic effects in their hosts, there is a need to identify effective substances with fewer adverse effects. For this reason, we investigated the effects of alpha- and beta-pinene, known for their various biological effects, on the mortality and reproductive performance of R. microplus engorged female ticks. The products were diluted in a 2% Tween 80 aqueous solution. The ticks were first weighed and then immersed in the test solutions for five minutes. Then, they were dried with paper towels and fixed dorsoventrally in Petri dishes, totalling five treatment groups for each pinene and a control group treated with the solvent alone. The ticks were monitored daily for mortality, and their eggs were collected and weighed. The larval hatching rate was estimated, and the pre-oviposition and incubation periods were determined. From these data, the following parameters were calculated: egg production index, fertility rate, estimated reproduction rate, percentages of reduction in oviposition and hatching, and product efficacy. Alpha-pinene showed better results at higher concentrations, unlike beta-pinene, which was more effective at lower concentrations. The effectiveness of alpha-pinene was 74% at a concentration of 14.0 Î¼L/mL, while beta-pinene showed 78% efficacy at 2.0 Î¼L/mL. The results indicated for the first time different effects of two isomers in ticks, suggesting that these compounds act on R. microplus females in different ways. (Â© 2024.

A follow up study was also conducted from December 2019 to March 2021 to estimate the transmission parameter of SP and GP outbreaks in South Wollo zone of Kutaber district, Amhara region. Tissue samples from outbreaks in Kundi and Haroye kebele of Kutaber district were taken to confirm the outbreak by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The transmission parameters were estimated using Generalized linear model (GLM) based on stochastic Susceptible Infected and Recovered (SIR) model. In South Wollo zone, 249 SGP outbreaks were reported from 2013 to 2019. The incidence differed between months, with a highest peak in October and November and a lowest peak in February. The basic reproduction ratios (R0) of the SGP disease outbreaks were 1.84 and 3 for Haroye and Kundi kebele outbreaks, respectively. The disease is distributed throughout the zone and the investigated active outbreaks had moderate transmission between animals. Hence, it needs a great effort which focuses on the application of control measures that reduce the transmission of the disease.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Although instrumental analysis has chemically characterized odor volatiles from various human biospecimens, it remains unclear what perceptually constitutes human scent (HS) for dogs. This may be in part due to the lack of methodology and equipment to train and evaluate HS perception. The aims of this research were 1) to develop an automated human scent olfactometer (AHSO) to present HS to dogs in a controlled setting and 2) use the AHSO to evaluate dogs' response to different scented articles and individual components of HS. A human volunteer was placed in a clear acrylic chamber and using a vacuum pump and computer-controlled valves, the headspace of this chamber was carried to one of three ports in a different room. Dogs were trained to search all three ports of the olfactometer and alert to the one containing HS. In Experiment 1 and 2, the AHSO was validated by testing two dogs naÃ¯ve to HS (Experiment 1) and five certified Search and Rescue (SAR) teams naÃ¯ve to the apparatus (Experiment 2). All dogs showed sensitivity and specificity to HS &gt; 95% in the apparatus. In Experiment 3, we used a spontaneous generalization paradigm to evaluate generalization from the HS chamber to different scented articles exposed to the same volunteer and to a breath sample. Dogs' response rate to the different scented articles was &lt; 10% but exceeded 40% for the breath sample. In Experiment 4, we replicated this result by re-testing spontaneous generalization to breath and when the volunteer had breath exhausted/removed from the chamber. Dogs' response rate to breath alone was 88% and only 50% when breath was removed. Altogether, the data indicate that exhaled breath is an important and salient component of HS under these conditions.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.

Innovative payment mechanisms, such as mobile money, could have benefits for recipients. An experimental study suggests that the use of mobile money, Zap delivery, might improve intra-household socio-economic dynamics on Niger. Our replication study evaluates the impact of Zap delivery in contrast to more traditional delivery mechanism. We examined original author's findings and estimated similar results about increasing household diet diversity without decreasing their durable and nondurable assets. The heterogeneity evaluation by age groups suggests that the Zap delivery had a different impact on older beneficiaries than younger ones. In addition, we evaluated the robustness, which considers multiple imputation and Lee bounds analysis; as well as a nutritional evaluation of children under 5 years using anthropometric measures.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=1810989&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Perry, Thomas</author><author>Morris, Rebecca</author><author>Lea, Rosanna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A decade of replication study in education?

Of the few which are conducted, many are conceptual rather than direct replications. With so few replication studies, and many of those that are attempted producing null results, the scientific status of the evidence base for educational policy and practice is in question. Replicating Makel and Pluckerâs review of the education replication literature, conducted in 2014, this paper presents a mapping review looking at rates of replication in education research from 2011 to 2020. We provide an overview of the number of replication studies by replication type, year, outcome, authorship, and journal. Our results are consistent with those of Makel and Plucker, revealing very low but gradually increasing rates of replication study in education. We discuss the role of replication in producing a robust and trustworthy evidence base for policy and practice, and some of the challenges in operationalising definitions of replication we encountered.

Yet small-scale manual replication methods alone are ill-suited to deal with this big data problem. Here, we conduct a discipline-wide replication census in science. Our sample (N = 14,126 papers) covers nearly all papers published in the six top-tier Psychology journals over the past 20 y. Using a validated machine learning model that estimates a paperâs likelihood of replication, we found evidence that both supports and refutes speculations drawn from a relatively small sample of manual replications. First, we find that a single overall replication rate of Psychology poorly captures the varying degree of replicability among subfields. Second, we find that replication rates are strongly correlated with research methods in all subfields. Experiments replicate at a significantly lower rate than do non-experimental studies. Third, we find that authorsâ cumulative publication number and citation impact are positively related to the likelihood of replication, while other proxies of research quality and rigor, such as an authorâs university prestige and a paperâs citations, are unrelated to replicability. Finally, contrary to the ideal that media attention should cover replicable research, we find that media attention is positively related to the likelihood of replication failure. Our assessments of the scale and scope of replicability are important next steps toward broadly resolving issues of replicability.

Here at EJPA, we encourage researchers to conduct direct replication studies in psychological assessment, and these can be submitted in the registered report format (preferred) or as a regular article. Researchers can submit direct replications of previous studies that have been published in EJPA but can also submit direct replications of assessment research published elsewhere. Direct replications of research published in EJPA have demonstrated sufficient quality to warrant publication in the journal (as evidenced by the publication of the original study), but direct replications of research published elsewhere will need to demonstrate that the research is of sufficient quality to feature in the journal. That is, the study being replicated might have several weaknesses and not meet quality standards at EJPA. Nevertheless, we will entertain all replication studies and particularly encourage those that aim to replicate original studies of assessment tools that have been widely used for many years. In fact, we have made several attempts to encourage the submission of replication studies over the past few years (e.g., editorials, editorial presentations, and 'meet the editors' open meetings at conferences). However, despite this explicit openness toward replication studies, it is striking that we have received so few of them. We hope this editorial encourages authors to conduct replication studies in psychological assessment research, and we look forward to receiving such submissions in the future.

Regardless of its importance, limited research is available on detection dog odor generalization. The objectives of this study were (1) evaluate the use of an intermittent schedule of reinforcement to assess generalization in dogs and (2) evaluate olfactory generalization from a single exemplar of smokeless powder (SP). Dogs (N = 5) were trained to detect SP in an automated olfactometer under an intermittent schedule of reinforcement where only 60% of correct responses were reinforced. After training, eight non-reinforced probe trials were inserted within a session. A total of 15 testing odors were evaluated across 15 consecutive sessions (one odor/session). Six of the testing odors were control and the remaining testing odors were objects indirectly exposed to SP, objects that contained or were directly exposed to SP, single-base SP and diphenylamine (the main volatile present in the headspace of SP). Dogsâ response rate to all testing odors except for the cotton gauzes and t-shirt cloths exposed to the headspace of SP, the simulated IED, and Getxent tubes exposed to direct contact with SP were statistically lower than their response rate of actual SP. The response rate to SP was not different across all 15 testing sessions suggesting that the intermittent schedule of reinforcement, maintained dog motivation and performance. Data show that the outlined method is a good approach to study generalization in detection dogs. These results also highlight dog generalization to SP varieties and associated odors.

There is an urgent desire for highly accurate and efficient dose calculation methods. This study aims to develop a dose super resolution-based deep learning model for fast and accurate dose prediction in clinical practice.; Method: A Multi-stage Dose Super-Resolution Network (MDSR Net) architecture with sparse masks module and multi-stage progressive dose distribution restoration method were developed to predict high-resolution dose distribution using low-resolution data. A total of 340 VMAT plans from different disease sites were used, among which 240 randomly selected nasopharyngeal, lung, and cervix cases were used for model training, and the remaining 60 cases from the same sites for model benchmark testing, and additional 40 cases from the unseen site (breast and rectum) was used for model generalizability evaluation. The clinical calculated dose with a grid size of 2â¯mm was used as baseline dose distribution. The input included the dose distribution with 4â¯mm grid size and CT images. The model performance was compared with HD U-Net and cubic interpolation methods using Dose-volume histograms (DVH) metrics and global gamma analysis with 1%/1â¯mm and 10% low dose threshold. The correlation between the prediction error and the dose, dose gradient, and CT values was also evaluated.; Results: The prediction errors of MDSR were 0.06-0.84% of D mean indices, and the gamma passing rate was 83.1-91.0% on the benchmark testing dataset, and 0.02-1.03% and 71.3-90.3% for the generalization dataset respectively. The model performance was significantly higher than the HD U-Net and interpolation methods (pâ¯&lt;â¯0.05). The mean errors of the MDSR model decreased (monotonously by 0.03-0.004%) with dose and increased (by 0.01-0.73%) with the dose gradient. There was no correlation between prediction errors and the CT values.; Conclusion: The proposed MDSR model achieved good agreement with the baseline high-resolution dose distribution, with small prediction errors for DVH indices and high gamma passing rate for both seen and unseen sites, indicating a robust and generalizable dose prediction model. The model can provide fast and accurate high-resolution dose distribution for clinical dose calculation, particularly for the routine practice of OLART.; Competing Interests: Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Different regulators have different reporting requirements for report transmission. This results in replication of each ICSR that will exist in multiple locations. Adding in the fact that each case will go through multiple versions, different recipients may receive different case versions at different times, potentially influencing patient safety decisions and potentially amplifying or obscuring safety signals inappropriately.; Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the magnitude of replication, the variability among recipients, and the subsequent divergence across recipients of ICSRs.; Methods: Seven participating TransCelerate Member Companies (MCs) queried their respective safety databases covering a 3-year period and provided aggregate ICSR submission statistics for expedited safety reports to an independent project manager. As measured in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), ICSR volume for these seven MCs makes up approximately 20% of the total case volume. Aggregate metrics were calculated from the company data, specifically: (i) number of ICSR transmissions, (ii) average number of recipients (ANR) per case version transmitted, (iii) a submission selectivity metric, which measures the percentage of recipients not having received all sequential case version numbers, and (iv) percent of common ISCRs residing in two or more MAH databases.; Results: The analysis reflects 2,539,802 case versions, distributed through 7,602,678 submissions. The overall mean replication rate is 3.0 submissions per case version. The distribution of the ANR replication measure was observed to be very long-tailed, with a significant fraction of case versions (~Â 12.4% of all transmissions) being sent to ten or more HA recipients. Replication is higher than average for serious, unlisted, and literature cases, ranging from 3.5 to 6.1 submissions per version. Within the subset of ICSR versions sent to three recipients, a significant degree of variability in the actual recipients (i.e., HAs) was observed, indicating that there is not one single combination of the same three HAs predominantly receiving an ICSR. Submission selectivity increases with the case version. For case version 6, the range of the submission selectivity for the MAHs ranges from ~Â 10% to over 50%, with a median of 30.2%. Within the participating MAHs, the percentage of cases that reside within at least two safety databases is approximately 2% across five databases. Further analysis of the data from three MAHs showed percentages of 13.4%, 15.6%, and 27.9% of ICSRs originating from HAs and any other partners such as other MAHs and other institutions.; Conclusion: Replication of ICSRs and the variation of available safety information in recipient databases were quantified and shown to be substantial. Our work shows that multiple processors and medical reviewers will likely handle the same original ICSR as a result of replication. Aside from the obvious duplicate work, this phenomenon could conceivably lead to differing clinical assessments and decisions. If replication could be reduced or even eliminated, this would enable more focus on activities with a benefit for patient safety. (Â© 2022.

Large replication projects in psychology and cancer biology have evaluated the replicability of their fields but no collaborative effort has been undertaken in sports and exercise science. We propose to undertake such an effort here. As this is the first large replication project in this field, there is no agreed-upon protocol for selecting studies to replicate. Criticism of previous selection protocols include claims they were non-randomised and non-representative. Any selection protocol in sports and exercise science must be representative to provide an accurate estimate of replicability of the field. Our aim is to produce a protocol for selecting studies to replicate for inclusion in a large replication project in sports and exercise science.; Methods: The proposed selection protocol uses multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria for replication study selection, including: the year of publication and citation rankings, research disciplines, study types, the research question and key dependent variable, study methods and feasibility. Studies selected for replication will be stratified into pools based on instrumentation and expertise required, and will then be allocated to volunteer laboratories for replication. Replication outcomes will be assessed using a multiple inferential strategy and descriptive information will be reported regarding the final number of included and excluded studies, and original author responses to requests for raw data.

With data from four large-scale replication projects in experimental psychology and economics, and techniques from machine learning, we train predictive models and study which variables drive predictable replication. The models predicts binary replication with a cross-validated accuracy rate of 70% (AUC of 0.77) and estimates of relative effect sizes with a Spearman Ï of 0.38. The accuracy level is similar to market-aggregated beliefs of peer scientists [1, 2]. The predictive power is validated in a pre-registered out of sample test of the outcome of [3], where 71% (AUC of 0.73) of replications are predicted correctly and effect size correlations amount to Ï = 0.25. Basic features such as the sample and effect sizes in original papers, and whether reported effects are single-variable main effects or two-variable interactions, are predictive of successful replication. The models presented in this paper are simple tools to produce cheap, prognostic replicability metrics. These models could be useful in institutionalizing the process of evaluation of new findings and guiding resources to those direct replications that are likely to be most informative.

This study measured six reproduction traits in a Sichuan white goose population (209 individuals), including fertility, qualified egg rate, plasma concentrations of progesterone (P), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin (PRL) and oestrogen (E2).2. Whole-genome resequencing data from the same goose population (209 individuals) were used in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) utilising a mixed linear model to investigate the genes and genetic markers associated with reproduction traits. The frequency of the selected SNPs and haplotypes were determined using the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method.3. In total, 42 SNPs significantly associated with these traits were identified. A haplotype block was constructed based on five SNPs that were significantly associated with qualified egg rate, with individuals having the haplotype CCTTAAGGAA having the lowest qualified egg rate.4. In conclusion, these results provided potential markers for marker-assisted selection to improve goose reproductive performance and a basis for elucidating the genetics of goose reproduction.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=35775663&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zou, Jennifer</author><author>Zhou, Jinjing</author><author>Faller, Sarah</author><author>Brown, Robert P</author><author>Sankararaman, Sriram S</author><author>Eskin, Eleazar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Accurate modeling of replication rates in genome-wide association studies by accounting for Winner's Curse and study-specific heterogeneity.</title><secondary-title>G3 (Bethesda, Md.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>G3 (Bethesda, Md.)</full-title><abbr-1>G3 (Bethesda, Md.)</abbr-1></periodical><volume>12</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>confounding</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>genome-wide association study (GWAS)</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Multifactorial Inheritance</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide*</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword><keyword>Winnerâs Curse</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-12-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2160-1836</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/g3journal/jkac261</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with complex human traits, but only a fraction of variants identified in discovery studies achieve significance in replication studies. Replication in genome-wide association studies has been well-studied in the context of Winner's Curse, which is the inflation of effect size estimates for significant variants due to statistical chance. However, Winner's Curse is often not sufficient to explain lack of replication. Another reason why studies fail to replicate is that there are fundamental differences between the discovery and replication studies. A confounding factor can create the appearance of a significant finding while actually being an artifact that will not replicate in future studies. We propose a statistical framework that utilizes genome-wide association studies and replication studies to jointly model Winner's Curse and study-specific heterogeneity due to confounding factors. We apply this framework to 100 genome-wide association studies from the Human Genome-Wide Association Studies Catalog and observe that there is a large range in the level of estimated confounding. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to distinguish when studies fail to replicate due to statistical noise and when they fail due to confounding. (Â© The Author(s) 2022.

In second language studies, however, reviews share widespread concern about the infrequency of replication. A common but speculative explanation for this situation is that replication studies are not valued because they lack originality and/or innovation. To better understand and respond to the infrequency of replication in our field, 354 researchers were surveyed about their attitudes toward replication and their practices conducting replication studies. Responses included worldwide participation from researchers with and without replication experience. Overall, replications were evaluated as relevant and valuable to the field. Claims that replication studies lack originality/innovation were not supported. However, dissemination issues were identified: half of published replication studies lacked explicit labeling and one quarter of completed replications were unpublished. Explicit labeling of replication studies and training in research methodology and dissemination can address this situation.

We introduce and adapt replication methods advocated in psychology to the aims and procedural needs of machine learning research. In Study 1, we illustrate these methods with the use of an empirical data set, assessing the replication success of a predictive accuracy measure, namely, RÂ² on the cross-validated and test sets of the samples. We introduce three replication aims. First, tests of inconsistency examine whether single replications have successfully rejected the original study. Rejection will be supported if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of RÂ² difference estimates between replication and original does not contain zero. Second, tests of consistency help support claims of successful replication. We can decide apriori on a region of equivalence, where population values of the difference estimates are considered equivalent for substantive reasons. The 90% CI of a different estimate lying fully within this region supports replication. Third, we show how to combine replications to construct meta-analytic intervals for better precision of predictive accuracy measures. In Study 2, RÂ² is reduced from the original in a subset of replication studies to examine the ability of the replication procedures to distinguish true replications from nonreplications. We find that when combining studies sampled from same population to form meta-analytic intervals, random-effects methods perform best for cross-validated measures while fixed-effects methods work best for test measures. Among machine learning methods, regression was comparable to many complex methods, while support vector machine performed most reliably across a variety of scenarios. Social scientists who use machine learning to model empirical data can use these methods to enhance the reliability of their findings.

This study clarifies relations of depression diagnoses and symptoms with AMPD personality pathology. Method: Two samples (Ns 402 and 601) of outpatients and community-dwelling adults completed four depression (criteria met for major depressive disorder and dysthymia; dysphoria and low well-being scales), ten trait (two scales for each of five domainsânegative affectivity, detachment, disinhibition, antagonism, psychoticism), and eight dysfunction (four scales for each of two domainsâself- and interpersonal pathology) measures. Diagnoses were made using a semi-structured interview; other measures were self-reports. We quantified cross-sectional relations between depression and personality pathology with correlation and multiple regression analyses. Results: Collectively (median RÂ² ; ps &lt; 0.0001), the trait (0.46) and dysfunction (0.50) scales predicted the depression measures strongly, with most predictive power shared (0.41) between traits and dysfunction. However, trait and dysfunction scales altogether predicted depression (median RÂ² = 0.54) more strongly than either domain alone, ps &lt; 0.0001. Participants with depression diagnoses showed elevations on all nonadaptive trait and personality dysfunction measures, particularly negative temperament/affectivity and self-pathology measures. Limitations: Generalization of findings to other populations (e.g., adolescents), settings (e.g., primary care), and measures (e.g., traditional personality disorder diagnoses) is uncertain. Cross-sectional analyses did not test changes over time or establish causality. Conclusions: The AMPD is highly relevant to depression. Assessment of personality pathology, including both personality dysfunction and maladaptive-range traits, stands to advance understanding of depression in adults.

During their interdivision cycle (Ï min), cells enlarge by elongation only, but at faster growth in richer media, they are also wider. Changes in width W upon nutritional shift-up (shortening Ï) occur during the division process. The elusive signal directing the mechanism for W determination is likely related to the tightly linked duplications of the nucleoid (DNA) and the sacculus (peptidoglycan), the only two structures (macromolecules) existing in a single copy that are coupled, temporally and spatially. Six known parameters related to the nucleoid structure and replication are reasonable candidates to convey such a signal, all simple functions of the key number of replication positions n(=C/Ï), the ratio between the rates of growth (Ï -1 ) and of replication (C -1 ). The current analysis of available literature-recorded data discovered that, of these, nucleoid complexity NC[=(2 n -1)/(nÃln2)] is by far the most likely parameter affecting cell width W. The exceedingly high correlations found between these two seemingly unrelated measures (NC and W) indicate that coupling between them is of major importance to the species' survival. As an exciting corollary, to the best of our knowledge, a new, indirect approach to estimate DNA replication rate is revealed. Potential involvement of DNA topoisomerases in W determination is also proposed and discussed.; Competing Interests: Declaration of interests The authors declare no competing interests.

To this end, the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles for data have been developed and widely accepted in the research community. Research biospecimens are a resource that leads to much of this health research data but are also a form of data. Therefore, the FAIR principles should apply to biospecimens. Nevertheless, there is a widespread problem of not sharing biospecimen resources that is clearly visible within the research arena. The impacts of this are likely to include diversion of precious research funds into compiling duplicate biospecimen cohorts, detraction from research productivity as researchers compete for and create duplicate resources, and deterrence of attempts to assess research reproducibility. This article explores some of the barriers that may limit availability of FAIR biospecimens. These barriers relate to the type of biospecimen collections and the characteristics of the custodians that influence their intention and interest in sharing. Barriers also relate to the ethical, legal, and social issues concerning collections, the research context of the collections, and cost and expertise involved in repurposing collections to enable sharing. Several solutions to increase sharing are identified. Some have recently been implemented, including enhancing biospecimen locators with tools to guide researchers and facilitating transfer of research collections to centralized biobank infrastructures at the conclusion of projects. New proposed solutions include improving search capabilities within publication databases, and introduction of evidence-based justifications for all new collections into peer-reviewed grant competition processes. It is recognized that there are both scientific factors and practical reasons that can impose limits to sharing biospecimens. However, funding availability, productivity, and progress in health research all stand to benefit from improved sharing of research biospecimen collections.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=38346330&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luijken, K</author><author>Lohmann, A</author><author>Alter, U</author><author>Claramunt Gonzalez, J</author><author>Clouth, F J</author><author>Fossum, J L</author><author>Hesen, L</author><author>Huizing, A H J</author><author>Ketelaar, J</author><author>Montoya, A K</author><author>Nab, L</author><author>Nijman, R C C</author><author>Penning de Vries, B B L</author><author>Tibbe, T D</author><author>Wang, Y A</author><author>Groenwold, R H H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replicability of simulation studies for the investigation of statistical methods: the RepliSims project.</title><secondary-title>Royal Society open science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Royal Society open science</full-title><abbr-1>Royal Society open science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>231003</pages><volume>11</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>open materials</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword><keyword>simulation studies</keyword><keyword>statistical methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024-01-17</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2054-5703</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rsos.231003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Results of simulation studies evaluating the performance of statistical methods can have a major impact on the way empirical research is implemented. However, so far there is limited evidence of the replicability of simulation studies. Eight highly cited statistical simulation studies were selected, and their replicability was assessed by teams of replicators with formal training in quantitative methodology. The teams used information in the original publications to write simulation code with the aim of replicating the results. The primary outcome was to determine the feasibility of replicability based on reported information in the original publications and supplementary materials. Replicasility varied greatly: some original studies provided detailed information leading to almost perfect replication of results, whereas other studies did not provide enough information to implement any of the reported simulations. Factors facilitating replication included availability of code, detailed reporting or visualization of data-generating procedures and methods, and replicator expertise. Replicability of statistical simulation studies was mainly impeded by lack of information and sustainability of information sources. We encourage researchers publishing simulation studies to transparently report all relevant implementation details either in the research paper itself or in easily accessible supplementary material and to make their simulation code publicly available using permanent links.; Competing Interests: We declare we have no competing interests.

Gram-negative bacteria like Salmonella employ various strategies, such as altering membrane properties, to resist treatment. Their two-membrane structure affects susceptibility to antibiotics, whereas specific proteins and the peptidoglycan layer maintain envelope integrity. Disruptions can compromise stability and resistance profile toward xenobiotics. In this study, we investigated the unexplored protein SanA's role in modifying bacterial membranes, impacting antibiotic resistance, and intracellular replication within host cells.; Methods: We generated a sanA deletion mutant and complemented it in trans to assess its biological function. High-throughput phenotypic profiling with Biolog Phenotype microarrays was conducted using 240 xenobiotics. Membrane properties and permeability were analyzed via cytochrome c binding, hexadecane adhesion, nile red, and ethidium bromide uptake assays, respectively. For intracellular replication analysis, primary bone marrow macrophages served as a host cells model.; Results: Our findings demonstrated that the absence of sanA increased membrane permeability, hydrophilicity, and positive charge, resulting in enhanced resistance to certain antibiotics that target peptidoglycan synthesis. Furthermore, the sanA deletion mutant demonstrated enhanced replication rates within primary macrophages, highlighting its ability to evade the bactericidal effects of the immune system. Taking together, we provide valuable insights into a poorly known SanA protein, highlighting the complex interplay among bacterial genetics, membrane physiology, and antibiotic resistance, underscoring its significance in understanding Salmonella pathogenicity.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. The author(s) declared that they were an editorial board member of Frontiers, at the time of submission. This had no impact on the peer review process and the final decision.

The reproducibility of computational aspects of research is a key component of scientific reproducibility but has not yet been assessed at scale for Jupyter notebooks associated with biomedical publications.; Approach: We address computational reproducibility at 2 levels: (i) using fully automated workflows, we analyzed the computational reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks associated with publications indexed in the biomedical literature repository PubMed Central. We identified such notebooks by mining the article's full text, trying to locate them on GitHub, and attempting to rerun them in an environment as close to the original as possible. We documented reproduction success and exceptions and explored relationships between notebook reproducibility and variables related to the notebooks or publications. (ii) This study represents a reproducibility attempt in and of itself, using essentially the same methodology twice on PubMed Central over the course of 2 years, during which the corpus of Jupyter notebooks from articles indexed in PubMed Central has grown in a highly dynamic fashion.; Results: Out of 27,271 Jupyter notebooks from 2,660 GitHub repositories associated with 3,467 publications, 22,578 notebooks were written in Python, including 15,817 that had their dependencies declared in standard requirement files and that we attempted to rerun automatically. For 10,388 of these, all declared dependencies could be installed successfully, and we reran them to assess reproducibility. Of these, 1,203 notebooks ran through without any errors, including 879 that produced results identical to those reported in the original notebook and 324 for which our results differed from the originally reported ones. Running the other notebooks resulted in exceptions.; Conclusions: We zoom in on common problems and practices, highlight trends, and discuss potential improvements to Jupyter-related workflows associated with biomedical publications.

The replication team consisted of three reviewers. Two reviewers blocked off time during the replication. The total time to complete tasks and the meta-analysis results were compared with the index 2weekSR study. Review process fidelity scores (FSs) were calculated for review methods and outcomes. Barriers to completing the replication were identified.; Results: The review was completed over 63 person-hours (11 workdays/15 calendar days). A FS of 0.95 was achieved for the methods, with 3 (of 8) tasks only partially replicated, and an FS of 0.63 for the outcomes, with 6 (of 7) only partially replicated and one task was not replicated. Nonreplication was mainly caused by missing information in the index 2weekSR study that was not required in standard reporting guidelines. The replication arrived at the same conclusions as the original study.; Conclusion: A 2weekSR study was replicated by a small team of three reviewers supported by automation tools. Including additional information when reporting SRs should improve their replicability.; Competing Interests: Declaration of competing interest A.M.S. and P.G. are the coinventors of the 2weekSR method but were not aware of and not involved in the replication study at the time of its conduct.

Primary respiratory cell lines are used in IAV research to model the host's upper respiratory tract in vitro . However, primary cell lines are limited by their passaging capacity and are time-consuming for use in industry and research pipelines. We were interested in developing and characterizing a biologically relevant immortalized swine respiratory cell line that could be used for efficient propagation and characterization of swine IAV isolates.; Methods: Lung tissue for the generation of primary swine respiratory cells were isolated from the bronchi of an 8-week-old Yorkshire/Hampshire pig, which were immortalized by transduction of the SV40 T antigen using a lentivirus vector. The transduction of the SV40 T antigen was confirmed by Real Time RT-PCR in cells passaged greater than twenty times.; Results: Immortalized swine respiratory cells expressed primarily Î±2,6 sialic acid receptors and were susceptible to both swine and human IAVs, with swine viruses exhibiting higher replication rates. Notably, infection with a swine H3N2 isolate prompted increased IL-6 and IL-1Î± protein secretion compared to a seasonal human H3N2 virus. Even after 20 passages, the immortalized cells maintained the primary respiratory cell phenotype and remained permissive to IAV infection without exogenous trypsin.; Discussion: In summary, our developed immortalized swine respiratory cell line offers an alternative in vitro substrate for studying IAV replication and transmission dynamics in pigs, overcoming the limitations of primary respiratory cells in terms of low passage survivability and cost.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

The NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC) provides &gt;120 cancer image collections according to the FAIR principles and is designed to be used with cloud ML services. Here, we explore its potential to facilitate reproducibility in CompPath research.; Methods: Using the IDC, we implemented two experiments in which a representative ML-based method for classifying lung tumor tissue was trained and/or evaluated on different datasets. To assess reproducibility, the experiments were run multiple times with separate but identically configured instances of common ML services.; Results: The results of different runs of the same experiment were reproducible to a large extent. However, we observed occasional, small variations in AUC values, indicating a practical limit to reproducibility.; Conclusions: We conclude that the IDC facilitates approaching the reproducibility limit of CompPath research (i) by enabling researchers to reuse exactly the same datasets and (ii) by integrating with cloud ML services so that experiments can be run in identically configured computing environments.; Competing Interests: Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

However, this mechanism is unlikely to explain recently observed trial results that demonstrated the sequencing of ARSI and RT significantly impacts clinical outcomes, with adjuvant ARSI following RT yielding superior outcomes to neoadjuvant/concurrent therapy. We hypothesized this is driven by differential effects on AR-signaling and alternative DNA repair pathway engagement based on ARSI/RT sequencing.; Methods: We explored the effects of ARSI sequencing with RT (neoadjuvant vs concurrent vs adjuvant) in multiple prostate cancer cell lines using androgen-deprived media and validation with the anti-androgen enzalutamide. The effects of ARSI sequencing were measured with clonogenic assays, AR-target gene transcription and translation quantification, cell cycle analysis, DNA damage and repair assays, and xenograft animal validation studies.; Results: Adjuvant ARSI after RT was significantly more effective at killing colony forming cells and decreasing the transcription and translation of downstream AR-target genes across all prostate cancer models evaluated. These results were reproduced in xenograft studies. The differential effects of ARSI sequencing were not fully explained by NHEJ inhibition alone, but by the additional disruption of homologous recombination specifically with adjuvant sequencing of ARSI.; Conclusion: We demonstrate that altered sequencing of ARSI and RT mediates differential anti-AR-signaling and anti-cancer effects, with the greatest benefit from adjuvant ARSI following RT. These results, combined with our prior clinical findings, support the superiority of an adjuvant-based sequencing approach when using ARSI with RT. (Â© 2023.

The authors argue that role knowledge triggers self-serving interpretations of the case-related information that is the foundation of settlement bargaining. Self-servingly biased perception subsequently impedes successful settlement bargaining. We replicate the experiment in the computer laboratory. Our results are largely in line with the original findings. When participants know their bargaining role before studying the case materials rather than afterwards, settlement frequency decreases. This treatment effect is substantially smaller than in the original study. Given the new data, a Bayesian replication analysis reallocates the large share of credibility to a null model. We argue that this result is driven by the much smaller effect size that we observe in the highly controlled environment of the laboratory. Moreover, we extend the original analysis by estimating causal mediation effects of self-serving bias measures on the observed relationship between role-knowledge and settlement outcomes and find that self-servingly weighing legal arguments completely mediates the negative effect of role-knowledge on settlement frequency. In conclusion, we evaluate our replication as successful.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=1775680&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bonett, Douglas G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Design and analysis of replication studies</title><secondary-title>Organizational Research Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Organizational Research Methods</full-title><abbr-1>Organizational Research Methods</abbr-1></periodical><pages>513-529</pages><volume>24</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>confidence intervals</keyword><keyword>Confidence Limits (Statistics)</keyword><keyword>directional tests</keyword><keyword>equivalence tests</keyword><keyword>Experimental Design</keyword><keyword>Experimental Replication</keyword><keyword>inconclusive replication</keyword><keyword>Measurement</keyword><keyword>Methodology</keyword><keyword>nonreplication evidence</keyword><keyword>replication evidence</keyword><keyword>Sample Size</keyword><keyword>sample size requirements</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1094-4281</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1094428120911088</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Issues surrounding the importance and interpretation of replication research have generated considerable debate and controversy in recent years. Some of the controversy can be attributed to imprecise and inadequate specifications of the statistical criteria needed to assess replication and nonreplication. Two types of statistical replication evidence and four types of statistical nonreplication evidence are described. In addition, three types of inconclusive statistical replication evidence are described. An important benefit of a replication study is the ability to combine an effect-size estimate from the original study with an effect-size estimate from the follow-up study to obtain a more precise and generalizable effect-size estimate. The sample size in the follow-up study is an important design consideration, and some methods for determining the follow-up sample size requirements are discussed. R functions are provided that can be used to analyze results from a replication study. R functions to determine the appropriate sample size in the follow-up study also are provided.

We replicate 21 systematically selected experimental studies in the social sciences published in Nature and Science between 2010 and 2015 16-36 . The replications follow analysis plans reviewed by the original authors and pre-registered prior to the replications. The replications are high powered, with sample sizes on average about five times higher than in the original studies. We find a significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 13 (62%) studies, and the effect size of the replications is on average about 50% of the original effect size. Replicability varies between 12 (57%) and 14 (67%) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated true-positive rate is 67% in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71%, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility. Furthermore, we find that peer beliefs of replicability are strongly related to replicability, suggesting that the research community could predict which results would replicate and that failures to replicate were not the result of chance alone.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31346273&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Antwi, Samuel O</author><author>Bamlet, William R</author><author>Pedersen, Katrina S</author><author>Chaffee, Kari G</author><author>Risch, Harvey A</author><author>Shivappa, Nitin</author><author>Steck, Susan E</author><author>Anderson, Kristin E</author><author>Bracci, Paige M</author><author>Polesel, Jerry</author><author>Serraino, Diego</author><author>La Vecchia, Carlo</author><author>Bosetti, Cristina</author><author>Li, Donghui</author><author>Oberg, Ann L</author><author>Arslan, Alan A</author><author>Albanes, Demetrius</author><author>Duell, Eric J</author><author>Huybrechts, Inge</author><author>Amundadottir, Laufey T</author><author>Hoover, Robert</author><author>Mannisto, Satu</author><author>Chanock, Stephen J</author><author>Zheng, Wei</author><author>Shu, Xiao-Ou</author><author>Stepien, Magdalena</author><author>Canzian, Federico</author><author>Bueno-de-Mesquita, Bas</author><author>QuirÃ³s, JosÃ© Ramon</author><author>Zeleniuch-Jacquotte, Anne</author><author>Bruinsma, Fiona</author><author>Milne, Roger L</author><author>Giles, Graham G</author><author>HÃ©bert, James R</author><author>Stolzenberg-Solomon, Rachael Z</author><author>Petersen, Gloria M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pancreatic cancer risk is modulated by inflammatory potential of diet and ABO genotype: a consortia-based evaluation and replication study.</title><secondary-title>Carcinogenesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Carcinogenesis</full-title><abbr-1>Carcinogenesis</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1056-1067</pages><volume>39</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>ABO Blood-Group System/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Feeding Behavior/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inflammation/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Inflammation/complications</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Pancreas/immunology</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms/*blood</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms/immunology</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires/statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-07-30</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1460-2180</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/carcin/bgy072</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Diets with high inflammatory potential are suspected to increase risk for pancreatic cancer (PC). Using pooled analyses, we examined whether this association applies to populations from different geographic regions and population subgroups with varying risks for PC, including variation in ABO blood type. Data from six case-control studies (cases, n = 2414; controls, n = 4528) in the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4) were analyzed, followed by replication in five nested case-control studies (cases, n = 1268; controls, n = 4215) from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan). Two polymorphisms in the ABO locus (rs505922 and rs8176746) were used to infer participants' blood types. Dietary questionnaire-derived nutrient/food intake was used to compute energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E-DIIÂ®) scores to assess inflammatory potential of diet. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. Higher E-DII scores, reflecting greater inflammatory potential of diet, were associated with increased PC risk in PanC4 [ORQ5 versus Q1=2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.85-2.61, Ptrend &lt; 0.0001; ORcontinuous = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.17-1.24], and PanScan (ORQ5 versus Q1 = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.92-1.66, Ptrend = 0.008; ORcontinuous = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.15). As expected, genotype-derived non-O blood type was associated with increased PC risk in both the PanC4 and PanScan studies. Stratified analyses of associations between E-DII quintiles and PC by genotype-derived ABO blood type did not show interaction by blood type (Pinteraction = 0.10 in PanC4 and Pinteraction=0.13 in PanScan). The results show that consuming a pro-inflammatory diet and carrying non-O blood type are each individually, but not interactively, associated with increased PC risk. (Â© The Author(s) 2018.

Yet, extant eye-tracking research in social anxiety has mostly failed to report on psychometrics and attempts to replicate past results are rare. Therefore, we attempted to replicate a previously published eye-tracking study of gaze patterns in socially anxious and nonanxious participants as they viewed social threatening and neutral faces, while also exploring the psychometric properties of the attentional measures used. Methods: Gaze was monitored as participants freely viewed 60 different matrices comprised of eight socially-threatening and eight neutral faces, presented for 6000 ms each. Gaze patterns directed at threat and neutral areas of interest (AOIs) were compared by group. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were also evaluated. Results: Relative to healthy controls, socially anxious patients dwelled significantly longer on threat faces, replicating prior findings with the same task. Internal consistency of total dwell time on threat and neutral AOIs was high, and two-week test-retest reliability was acceptable. Limitations: Test-retest reliability was only examined for the control group, which had a small sample size. Conclusion: Increased dwell time on socially threatening stimuli is a reliable, stable, and generalizable measure of attentional bias in adults with social anxiety.

Anxiety symptomatology severity along different dimensions (generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social anxiety, and panic symptoms) was measured using parental and self-reports. Participants completed differential threat acquisition and extinction using an age-appropriate threat conditioning task. They then returned to the lab after 7â10 days to complete an extinction recall task that also assessed threat generalization. Results indicated that more severe overall anxiety was associated with greater cognitive and physiological threat responses during acquisition, extinction, and extinction recall. During acquisition and extinction, all anxiety dimensions manifested greater cognitive threat responses, while panic, separation anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms, but not generalized anxiety, were related to heightened physiological threat responses. In contrast, when we assessed generalization of cognitive threat responses, we found only generalized anxiety symptoms were associated with greater threat response generalization. The study provides preliminary evidence of specificity in threat responses during threat learning across youth with different anxiety symptoms.

This study is the first to develop a real-time monitoring system that kinetically detects luminescence reporter activity over time without sampling cells or culture supernatants for analyzing the virus replication. Subgenomic replicon experiments with hepatitis C virus (HCV) showed that transient translation and genome replication can be detected separately, with the first peak of translation observed at 3-4 h and replication beginning around 20 h after viral RNA introduction into cells. From the bioluminescence data set measured every 30 min (48 measurements per day), the initial rates of translation and replication were calculated, and their capacity levels were expressed as the sums of the measured signals in each process, which correspond to the areas on the kinetics graphs. The comparison of various HuH-7-derived cell lines showed that the bioluminescence profile differs among cell lines, suggesting that both translation and replication capacities potentially influence differences in HCV susceptibility. The effects of RNA mutations within the 5' UTR of the replicon on viral translation and replication were further analyzed in the system developed, confirming that mutations to the miR-122 binding sites primarily reduce replication activity rather than translation. The newly developed real-time monitoring system should be applied to the studies of various viruses and contribute to the analysis of transitions and progression of each process of their life cycle.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=35955844&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wong, Vivian C</author><author>Anglin, Kylie</author><author>Steiner, Peter M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Design-Based Approaches to Causal Replication Studies.</title><secondary-title>Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research</full-title><abbr-1>Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>723-738</pages><volume>23</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Causal inference</keyword><keyword>Causality</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Open science</keyword><keyword>Replication</keyword><keyword>Research Design*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1573-6695</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11121-021-01234-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent interest in promoting replication efforts assumes that there is well-established methodological guidance for designing and implementing these studies.

The paper describes research designs for replication and demonstrates how multiple designs may be combined in systematic replicationÂ efforts, as well as how diagnostic measures may be used to assess the extent to which CRF assumptions are met in field settings.

At the same time, these programs have noted that the proper way to analyze replication studies is far from a settled matter and have analyzed their data in several different ways. This presents 2 challenges to interpreting the results of these programs. First, different analysis methods assess different operational definitions of replication. Second, the properties of these methods are not necessarily common knowledge; it is possible for a successful replication to be deemed a failure by nearly all of the metrics used, and it is not always immediately clear how likely such errors are to occur. In this article, we describe the methods commonly used in replication research and how they imply specific operational definitions of replication. We then compute the probability of false failure (i.e., a successful replication is concluded to have failed) and false success determinations. These are shown to be high (often over 50%) and in many cases uncontrolled. We then demonstrate that errors are probable in the data to which these methods have been applied in the literature. We show that the probability that some reported conclusions about replication are incorrect can be as high as 75â80%.

Neupane et al. attempted to confirm the author's findings in independent family-based and case-control data sets but limited their analysis to only exonic coding regions (+/- 100 bp), which provide coverage of &lt;2% of variants found with WGS, therefore largely missing the single variants and the full regions which we reported as their findings. Rare variant WGS studies are challenging, in general, and particularly in AD, given the high cost of generation of such data and the late onset of disease, which limits the number of subjects used in family based designs. The authors addressed these challenges, as described in our initial article, by carefully balancing our ability to detect novel rare variants while keeping the false-positive rate under control and using an independent validation data set. They also emphasized the importance of testing for replication of rare variant findings in additional independent data sets. Assuming that the same methodology, study design and phenotype is being used and the exact same variants are being tested, the replication rate also highly depends on sample size, effect size and minor allele frequency. In addition, associations are subject to random variability due to sampling, confounding effects, and sequencing errors. While the exploratory analysis of Neupane et al. took on the challenging task of attempting replication of association signals from non-coding rare variants, using limited exonic data, the authors were pleased to see that of 13 candidate AD genes presented in their study, two (NALCN, C2CD3) still harbored rare exonic variants showing nominal significance for association with AD, in two independent studies, thereby providing corroboration and confirmation of a subset of their findings.

Recently, empirical interest in fear generalization as a transdiagnostic explanatory mechanism underlying anxiety-related disorders has accelerated. As there are now several studies of fear generalization across multiple types of anxiety-related disorders, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting behavioral measures (subjective ratings and psychophysiological indices) of fear generalization in anxiety-related disorder vs. comparison groups. We conducted systematic searches of electronic databases (conducted from JanuaryâOctober 2020) for fear generalization studies involving anxiety-related disorder groups or subclinical analog groups. A total of 300 records were full-text screened and two unpublished datasets were obtained, yielding 16 studies reporting behavioral fear generalization measures. Random-effects meta-analytic models and meta-regressions were applied to the identified data. Fear generalization was significantly heightened in anxiety-related disorder participants (N = 439) relative to comparison participants (N = 428). We did not identify any significant clinical, sample, or methodological moderators. Heightened fear generalization is quantitatively supported as distinguishing anxiety-related disorder groups from comparison groups. Evidence suggests this effect is transdiagnostic, relatively robust to experimental or sample parameters, and that generalization paradigms are a well-supported framework for neurobehavioral investigations of learning and emotion in anxiety-related disorders. We discuss these findings in the context of prior fear conditioning meta-analyses, past neuroimaging investigations of fear generalization in anxiety-related disorders, and future directions and challenges for the field.

This study proposed the Developmental Model of Computational Thinking through validating the structural relationships among the five factors of the CTS. To examine the model, a questionnaire including the CTS was administered to 472 middle school students. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the construct of the measurements, and a PLS-SEM analysis was used to validate the structural relationships among the factors. The results confirmed that the 19-item CTS has good item reliability, internal consistency, and construct reliability for measuring computational thinking (CT). In the Developmental Model of CT, decomposition and abstraction significantly predict all other three CT dispositions, suggesting that they are the two fundamental factors required for CT development. Moreover, a significant linear prediction path was shown starting from algorithmic thinking, evaluation, until generalization. Thus, a multi-level model was confirmed for the conceptual framework of CT. This model suggests a possible sequence for CT development which may provide a guideline for the teaching objectives of CT for different learning stages in different school levels. Decomposition and abstraction are especially suggested to be emphasized in school curricula before teaching algorithmic thinking or algorithm designs.

To investigate the key genes regulating reproduction in three fruit fly species, we selected genomic information of three fruit fly species, screened specific genes and single-copy homolog genes, and performed KEGG and GO enrichment analysis on specific genes and single-copy homolog genes of the strong positive select (SP); the results showed that Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett), B. dorsalis (Hendel), and C. capitata (Wiedemann) had seven, 11, and one Vitellogenin -related genes, respectively; Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett) had 84 specific genes enriched in immune system-related pathways; B. dorsalis (Hendel) had 1,121 specific genes enriched in signaling pathways related to cell growth and differentiation; C. capitata (Wiedemann) had 42 specific genes enriched in the degradation and metabolism pathways of exogenous organisms; Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett) may have a stronger immune system; B. dorsalis (Hendel) has a faster developmental and reproductive rate; and C. capitata (Wiedemann) has a higher detoxification capacity. Only one SP single-copy homolog gene (gene name: very long-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial) is enriched in the fatty acid metabolic pathway in both Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett) and B. dorsalis (Hendel) as well as in Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett) and C. capitata (Wiedemann). This study provides a molecular basis for studying the reproductive mechanisms of three fruit fly species and provides a scientific basis for developing effective control strategies for fruit flies.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

However, there is a growing "crisis" of reproducibility as evidenced by a recent Nature journal survey of more than 1500 researchers that found that 70% of researchers were not able to replicate results from other research groups and more than 50% of researchers were not able reproduce their own research results. In 2016, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced the "Rigor and Reproducibility" guidelines to support reproducibility in biomedical research. A key component of the NIH Rigor and Reproducibility guidelines is the recording and analysis of "provenance" information, which describes the origin or history of data and plays a central role in ensuring scientific reproducibility. As part of the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)-funded data provenance project, we have developed a new informatics framework called Provenance for Clinical and Healthcare Research (ProvCaRe) to extract, model, and analyze provenance information from published literature describing research studies. Using sleep medicine research studies that have made their data available through the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), we have developed an automated pipeline to identify and extract provenance metadata from published literature that is made available for analysis in the ProvCaRe knowledgebase. NSRR is the largest repository of sleep data from over 40,000 studies involving 36,000 participants and we used 75 published articles describing 6 research studies to populate the ProvCaRe knowledgebase. We evaluated the ProvCaRe knowledgebase with 28,474 "provenance triples" using hypothesis-driven queries to identify and rank research studies based on the provenance information extracted from published articles.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29854241&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McIntosh, Leslie D</author><author>Juehne, Anthony</author><author>Vitale, Cynthia R H</author><author>Liu, Xiaoyan</author><author>Alcoser, Rosalia</author><author>Lukas, J Christian</author><author>Evanoff, Bradley</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Repeat: a framework to assess empirical reproducibility in biomedical research.</title><secondary-title>BMC medical research methodology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC medical research methodology</full-title><abbr-1>BMC medical research methodology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>143</pages><volume>17</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Accessibility</keyword><keyword>Biomedical Research/*standards</keyword><keyword>Checklist/*methods</keyword><keyword>Data Accuracy*</keyword><keyword>Ehr</keyword><keyword>Electronic health records</keyword><keyword>Electronic Health Records/*standards</keyword><keyword>Evidence-Based Medicine/*standards</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Replication</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Secondary data re-use</keyword><keyword>Technology Assessment, Biomedical/methods</keyword><keyword>Technology Assessment, Biomedical/standards</keyword><keyword>Transparency</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-09-18</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2288</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12874-017-0377-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The reproducibility of research is essential to rigorous science, yet significant concerns of the reliability and verifiability of biomedical research have been recently highlighted. Ongoing efforts across several domains of science and policy are working to clarify the fundamental characteristics of reproducibility and to enhance the transparency and accessibility of research.; Methods: The aim of the proceeding work is to develop an assessment tool operationalizing key concepts of research transparency in the biomedical domain, specifically for secondary biomedical data research using electronic health record data. The tool (RepeAT) was developed through a multi-phase process that involved coding and extracting recommendations and practices for improving reproducibility from publications and reports across the biomedical and statistical sciences, field testing the instrument, and refining variables.; Results: RepeAT includes 119 unique variables grouped into five categories (research design and aim, database and data collection methods, data mining and data cleaning, data analysis, data sharing and documentation). Preliminary results in manually processing 40 scientific manuscripts indicate components of the proposed framework with strong inter-rater reliability, as well as directions for further research and refinement of RepeAT.; Conclusions: The use of RepeAT may allow the biomedical community to have a better understanding of the current practices of research transparency and accessibility among principal investigators. Common adoption of RepeAT may improve reporting of research practices and the availability of research outputs. Additionally, use of RepeAT will facilitate comparisons of research transparency and accessibility across domains and institutions.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28923006&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Katayama, Hajime</author><author>Ponomareva, Natalia</author><author>Sharma, Malvin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Central Bank Independence, Political Regimes, and the Sacrifice Ratio: A Replication Study of Caporale and Caporale (2008)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1035-1042</pages><volume>43</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Central Banks and Their Policies E58</keyword><keyword>Monetary Policy E52</keyword><keyword>Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior D72</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00222879</isbn><abstract>A recent article by Caporale and Caporale (2008, this Journal) provides an important finding on the determinants of the sacrifice ratio: central bank independence is not a determining factor for the sacrifice ratio when political regimes and other factors are controlled for.

The current study aimed to analyze the extant pedigrees of 6 living matrilines in different field cages to assess rates of cross-generational inbreeding and loss of genetic variation over time. All 6 matrilines showed increasing levels of inbreeding over generation time, although the rates of increase were different. The female-to-male-adult sex ratio was correlated with average matriline inbreeding levels, while the number of adult males was positively correlated with average matriline genetic diversity. Over five times more paternal half-sibs than maternal half-sibs were present because paternity had been restricted to a few males yearly. Therefore, the relatedness through the paternal lines was over five times greater than that of the maternal lines. Overall, each matriline lost low to moderate levels of genetic variation with time. The current rates of gene flow between field cages by cross-fostered infants have not stopped inbreeding within these matrilines or loss of diversity due to genetic drift. This situation probably developed because translocated animals, especially males, may not breed successfully. Only 4 of the 22 translocated individuals, all females, eventually reproduced, resulting in 13 offspring and generating an overall breeding success of 0.59 across all 6 study matrilines. However, even this low rate of reproduction by the translocated animals reduced inbreeding and kinship among matrilines and increased genetic heterogeneity in the matrilines. Based on this study, we propose several colony management strategies, including equalizing adult sex ratios to increase the effective population size in the field cages, increasing the number of cross-fostered infants, and relying more on multigenerational pedigree data to aid the alignment of genetic and behavioral management techniques.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=37821216&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anido-Alonso, Adriana</author><author>Alvarez-Estevez, Diego</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decentralized Data-Privacy Preserving Deep-Learning Approaches for Enhancing Inter-Database Generalization in Automatic Sleep Staging.</title><secondary-title>IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5610-5621</pages><volume>27</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Deep Learning*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Privacy</keyword><keyword>Sleep</keyword><keyword>Sleep Stages</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2168-2208</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/JBHI.2023.3310869</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Automatic sleep staging has been an active field of development. Despite multiple efforts, the area remains a focus of research interest. Indeed, while promising results have reported in past literature, uptake of automatic sleep scoring in the clinical setting remains low. One of the current issues regards the difficulty to generalization performance results beyond the local testing scenario, i.e. across data from different clinics. Issues derived from data-privacy restrictions, that generally apply in the medical domain, pose additional difficulties in the successful development of these methods. We propose the use of several decentralized deep-learning approaches, namely ensemble models and federated learning, for robust inter-database performance generalization and data-privacy preservation in automatic sleep staging scenario. Specifically, we explore four ensemble combination strategies (max-voting, output averaging, size-proportional weighting, and Nelder-Mead) and present a new federated learning algorithm, so-called sub-sampled federated stochastic gradient descent (ssFedSGD). To evaluate generalization capabilities of such approaches, experimental procedures are carried out using a leaving-one-database-out direct-transfer scenario on six independent and heterogeneous public sleep staging databases. The resulting performance is compared with respect to two baseline approaches involving single-database and centralized multiple-database derived models. Our results show that proposed decentralized learning methods outperform baseline local approaches, and provide similar generalization results to centralized database-combined approaches. We conclude that these methods are more preferable choices, as they come with additional advantages concerning improved scalability, flexible design, and data-privacy preservation.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=37651482&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Regan Kleinert, Jane</author><author>Kearns, Jaqueline F</author><author>Page, Judith L</author><author>Kleinert, Harold L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Promising Strategies for Teaching Augmentative and Alternative Communication in Inclusive Educational Settings: A Systematic Review.</title><secondary-title>Language, speech, and hearing services in schools</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Language, speech, and hearing services in schools</full-title><abbr-1>Language, speech, and hearing services in schools</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1333-1357</pages><volume>54</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Communication</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intellectual Disability*/therapy</keyword><keyword>Learning</keyword><keyword>Students</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-10-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1558-9129</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1044/2023_LSHSS-22-00178</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this article was to conduct a systematic review of the literature on teaching or increasing the use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) by students with significant intellectual disabilities and complex communication needs (CCNs) within inclusive school settings.; Method: A systematic review of research literature from 1998 to 2022 was completed using multiple electronic databases, as well as citation chaining and cited author reference searches. Three hundred two articles were located with 17 meeting criteria for inclusion in this systematic review. Articles were initially screened by one author for potential inclusion; the remaining 83 were coded by one author and reviewed for consensus by three authors for inclusion in this review. Articles were analyzed and rated regarding both level of research design and quality of methodology.; Results: All studies reported positive outcomes, with students with significant intellectual disabilities and CCN, of AAC intervention implemented in an inclusive setting. Fourteen over 17 studies were single-case designs with an average rating of 76% on the Single-Case Experimental Design measure of methodological quality. Less than half of the studies assessed generalization of subject learning. Review of interventions used in the studies, however, revealed the majority of studies utilized packages of interventions, making it difficult to determine the effectiveness of individual approaches.; Conclusions: This systematic review indicates there are promising interventions within inclusive settings for improved use of AAC by students with significant intellectual disabilities and CCN. Further research is needed, however, to obtain more data on generalization of student gains as well as to determine which specific interventions might be the most successful for this population of students in inclusive settings.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=37639539&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abbate, Isabella</author><author>Rozera, Gabriella</author><author>Cimini, Eleonora</author><author>Carletti, Fabrizio</author><author>Tartaglia, Eleonora</author><author>Rubino, Marika</author><author>Pittalis, Silvia</author><author>Esvan, Rozenn</author><author>Gagliardini, Roberta</author><author>Mondi, Annalisa</author><author>Mazzotta, Valentina</author><author>Camici, Marta</author><author>Girardi, Enrico</author><author>Vaia, Francesco</author><author>Puro, Vincenzo</author><author>Antinori, Andrea</author><author>Maggi, Fabrizio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Kinetics of TTV Loads in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Early Treated Acute HIV Infections.</title><secondary-title>Viruses</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Viruses</full-title><abbr-1>Viruses</abbr-1></periodical><volume>15</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>acute infection</keyword><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>HIV</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections*</keyword><keyword>HIV-1*/genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>immunity</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes, Mononuclear</keyword><keyword>senescence</keyword><keyword>T cell</keyword><keyword>Torque teno virus*/genetics</keyword><keyword>torquetenovirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-09-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1999-4915</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/v15091931</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Torquetenovirus (TTV) is the most abundant component of the human blood virome and its replication is controlled by a functioning immune system. In this study, TTV replication was evaluated in 21 people with acute HIV infection (AHI) and immune reconstitution following antiretroviral therapy (ART). PBMC-associated TTV and HIV-1 DNA, as well as plasma HIV-1 RNA, were measured by real-time PCR. CD4 and CD8 differentiation, activation, exhaustion, and senescence phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Thirteen healthy donors (HD) and twenty-eight chronically infected HIV individuals (CHI), late presenters at diagnosis, were included as control groups. TTV replication in AHI seems to be controlled by the immune system being higher than in HD and lower than in CHI. During ART, a transient increase in TTV DNA levels was associated with a significant perturbation of activation and senescence markers on CD8 T cells. TTV loads were positively correlated with the expansion of CD8 effector memory and CD57+ cells. Our results shed light on the kinetics of TTV replication in the context of HIV acute infection and confirm that the virus replication is strongly regulated by the modulation of the immune system.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=37766337&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Guohong</author><author>Wang, Chengchao</author><author>Wang, Jianping</author><author>Lv, Yingying</author><author>Li, Qian</author><author>Ma, Yuxin</author><author>Zhang, Xueyan</author><author>Li, Zhiyu</author><author>Chen, Guanglan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CNN-Bi-LSTM: A Complex Environment-Oriented Cattle Behavior Classification Network Based on the Fusion of CNN and Bi-LSTM.</title><secondary-title>Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)</abbr-1></periodical><volume>23</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>Agriculture*</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>behavior classification</keyword><keyword>Benchmarking*</keyword><keyword>Bi-LSTM</keyword><keyword>cattle</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>CNN</keyword><keyword>Entropy</keyword><keyword>Farms</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-09-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-8220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s23187714</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cattle behavior classification technology holds a crucial position within the realm of smart cattle farming. Addressing the requisites of cattle behavior classification in the agricultural sector, this paper presents a novel cattle behavior classification network tailored for intricate environments. This network amalgamates the capabilities of CNN and Bi-LSTM. Initially, a data collection method is devised within an authentic farm setting, followed by the delineation of eight fundamental cattle behaviors. The foundational step involves utilizing VGG16 as the cornerstone of the CNN network, thereby extracting spatial feature vectors from each video data sequence. Subsequently, these features are channeled into a Bi-LSTM classification model, adept at unearthing semantic insights from temporal data in both directions. This process ensures precise recognition and categorization of cattle behaviors. To validate the model's efficacy, ablation experiments, generalization effect assessments, and comparative analyses under consistent experimental conditions are performed. These investigations, involving module replacements within the classification model and comprehensive analysis of ablation experiments, affirm the model's effectiveness. The self-constructed dataset about cattle is subjected to evaluation using cross-entropy loss, assessing the model's generalization efficacy across diverse subjects and viewing perspectives. Classification performance accuracy is quantified through the application of a confusion matrix. Furthermore, a set of comparison experiments is conducted, involving three pertinent deep learning models: MASK-RCNN, CNN-LSTM, and EfficientNet-LSTM. The outcomes of these experiments unequivocally substantiate the superiority of the proposed model. Empirical results underscore the CNN-Bi-LSTM model's commendable performance metrics: achieving 94.3% accuracy, 94.2% precision, and 93.4% recall while navigating challenges such as varying light conditions, occlusions, and environmental influences. The objective of this study is to employ a fusion of CNN and Bi-LSTM to autonomously extract features from multimodal data, thereby addressing the challenge of classifying cattle behaviors within intricate scenes. By surpassing the constraints imposed by conventional methodologies and the analysis of single-sensor data, this approach seeks to enhance the precision and generalizability of cattle behavior classification. The consequential practical, economic, and societal implications for the agricultural sector are of considerable significance.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=37765771&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zanchetta, Margareth Santos</author><author>Metersky, Kateryna</author><author>Nazzal, Alessar</author><author>Dumitriu, Marie Elisabeth</author><author>Pais, Sasha</author><author>Mok, Yan Wei</author><author>Lam-Kin-Teng, Mary Rachel</author><author>Yu, Celine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Awakening Undergraduate Nursing Students' Critical Awareness About Men's Health, Health Literacy and Nursing Practice.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres</full-title><abbr-1>The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres</abbr-1></periodical><pages>388-403</pages><volume>55</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate*/methods</keyword><keyword>Health Literacy*/methods</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Men's Health</keyword><keyword>Students, Nursing*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1705-7051</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/08445621221144131</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: This article reports an evaluative replication study, including a workshop inspired by Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy. Purpose: Assess how the nursing students' participation in critiquing Canadian empirical evidence on men's health literacy provokes new perceptions; explore students' intentions of incorporating the aforementioned contents into their professional practice; and test students' skills to formulate a hypothetical short action plan about men's health literacy.; Methods: A qualitative evaluation study inspired by the qualitative program evaluation approach. The setting was a university-based Canadian undergraduate nursing program located in a major metropolitan city. Seventeen undergraduate students (representing 3.65% of year 4 student population) composed the sample. The educational intervention was two workshops (6âh duration; February 2017) including a lecture about men's health literacy with video presentations, class discussions and group work using Freire's method of reflection and discussion for awareness awakening. Hypothetical health literacy promotion was the key outcome. All interactions were digitally audiorecorded, verbatim transcribed and submitted to thematic analysis having as themes: Perspectives of awareness and knowledge expansion, and New personal-professional assets.; Results: Students were able to relate new knowledge with their own experiences in the classroom or in the practicum. Application of new knowledge was related to students' social circles and reported familiar health matters. Cultural and community life shaped knowledge expansion and references to men's behaviors.; Conclusions: Mobilization of personal knowledge awoke students' awareness about gaps in the nursing curriculum and the paucity of experiences in clinical placements relating to men's health literacy.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=36523144&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sakamoto, Megumi</author><author>Hori, Sakino</author><author>Yamamoto, Asahi</author><author>Yoneda, Taiki</author><author>Kuriya, Kenji</author><author>Takebayashi, Shin-Ichiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>scRepli-Seq: A Powerful Tool to Study Replication Timing and Genome Instability.</title><secondary-title>Cytogenetic and genome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cytogenetic and genome research</full-title><abbr-1>Cytogenetic and genome research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>161-170</pages><volume>162</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chromosome instability</keyword><keyword>Copy number analysis</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication Timing*</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA*/genetics</keyword><keyword>Genome</keyword><keyword>Genomic Instability</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mammalian chromosome</keyword><keyword>Mammals/genetics</keyword><keyword>Replication timing domain</keyword><keyword>scRepli-seq</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-859X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1159/000527168</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Advances in "omics" technology have made it possible to study a wide range of cellular phenomena at the single-cell level. Recently, we developed single-cell DNA replication sequencing (scRepli-seq) that measures replication timing (RT) by copy number differences between replicated and unreplicated genomic DNA in replicating single mammalian cells. This method has been used to reveal previously unrecognized static and dynamic natures of several hundred kilobases to a few megabases-scale chromosomal units called RT domains. Because RT domains are highly correlated to A/B compartments detected by Hi-C, scRepli-seq data can be used to predict the 3D organization of the genome in the nuclear space. scRepli-seq, which essentially measures the copy number, can also be applied to study genome instability.

This replication study reexamined the construct and concurrent validity of the Childhood Experiences Survey (CES), an expanded assessment of 10 conventional ACEs and seven novel childhood adversities. The CES was administered to three samples of adults with children in a Midwest state: (1) caregivers whose children were the subject of a screened-in child protective services report (n = 1,087), (2) low-income women who voluntarily enrolled in a home visiting program (n = 659), and (3) a convenience sample from general population (n = 667). The prevalence of childhood adversities and their intercorrelations were assessed. Extending a previous exploratory analysis, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the underlying structure of the CES, and tests of association were performed between the factors and adult mental health outcomes. Results confirmed that all 17 adversities were common and interrelated. For each sample, the 10 conventional ACEs fit a two-factor structure: child maltreatment and household dysfunction. The expanded assessment of 17 adversities fit a four-factor solution: direct victimization/household dysfunction, neglect, poverty, and family separation/loss. All factors were significantly associated (p &lt; .05) with depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms in all three samples. Implications for further measurement development aimed at advancing ACE research are discussed.

The increasing analytic complexity and valuation of novel statistical and methodological approaches to data place greater emphasis on statistical review. We will outline the controversies within statistical sciences that threaten rigor and reproducibility of research published in the behavioral sciences and discuss ongoing approaches to generate reliable and valid inferences from data. We outline nine major areas to consider for generally evaluating the rigor and reproducibility of published articles and apply this framework to the 116 Behaviour Research and Therapy (BRAT) articles published in 2018. The results of our analysis highlight a pattern of missing rigor and reproducibility elements, especially pre-registration of study hypotheses, links to statistical code/output, and explicit archiving or sharing data used in analyses. We recommend reviewers consider these elements in their peer review and that journals consider publishing results of these rigor and reproducibility ratings with manuscripts to incentivize authors to publish these elements with their manuscript.

The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers, using an approach in which the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before experimental work could begin. However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers. Here we report these barriers and challenges. First, many original papers failed to report key descriptive and inferential statistics: the data needed to compute effect sizes and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of 193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the original papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68% of the experiments. Second, none of the 193 experiments were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us to design protocols to repeat the experiments, so we had to seek clarifications from the original authors. While authors were extremely or very helpful for 41% of experiments, they were minimally helpful for 9% of experiments, and not at all helpful (or did not respond to us) for 32% of experiments. Third, once experimental work started, 67% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41% of those modifications could be implemented. Cumulatively, these three factors limited the number of experiments that could be repeated. This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication - it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible.; Competing Interests: TE, AD, BN Employed by the nonprofit Center for Open Science that has a mission to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research, NP, EI Employed by and hold shares in Science Exchange Inc (Â© 2021, Errington et al.)</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=34874008&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, Pengzhan</author><author>Lu, Lu</author><author>Tang, Yifa</author><author>Karniadakis, George Em</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying the generalization error in deep learning in terms of data distribution and neural network smoothness</title><secondary-title>Neural Networks</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neural Networks</full-title><abbr-1>Neural Networks</abbr-1></periodical><pages>85-99</pages><volume>130</volume><keywords><keyword>Cover complexity</keyword><keyword>Data distribution</keyword><keyword>Deep Neural Networks</keyword><keyword>Generalization (Learning)</keyword><keyword>Generalization error</keyword><keyword>Intelligent Design</keyword><keyword>Learnability</keyword><keyword>Learning</keyword><keyword>Meaningfulness</keyword><keyword>Neural network smoothness</keyword><keyword>Neural networks</keyword><keyword>Neural Networks</keyword><keyword>Training</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0893-6080</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.neunet.2020.06.024</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The accuracy of deep learning, i.e., deep neural networks, can be characterized by dividing the total error into three main types: approximation error, optimization error, and generalization error. Whereas there are some satisfactory answers to the problems of approximation and optimization, much less is known about the theory of generalization. Most existing theoretical works for generalization fail to explain the performance of neural networks in practice. To derive a meaningful bound, we study the generalization error of neural networks for classification problems in terms of data distribution and neural network smoothness. We introduce the cover complexity (CC) to measure the difficulty of learning a data set and the inverse of the modulus of continuity to quantify neural network smoothness. A quantitative bound for expected accuracy/error is derived by considering both the CC and neural network smoothness. Although most of the analysis is general and not specific to neural networks, we validate our theoretical assumptions and results numerically for neural networks by several data sets of images. The numerical results confirm that the expected error of trained networks scaled with the square root of the number of classes has a linear relationship with respect to the CC. We also observe a clear consistency between test loss and neural network smoothness during the training process. In addition, we demonstrate empirically that the neural network smoothness decreases when the network size increases whereas the smoothness is insensitive to training dataset size.

It is often assumed that assessing replication is straightforward: All one needs to do is repeat the study and see whether the results of the original and replication studies agree. This article shows that the statistical test for whether two studies obtain the same effect is smaller than the power of either study to detect an effect in the first place. Thus, unless the original study and the replication study have unusually high power (e.g., power of 98%), a single replication study will not have adequate sensitivity to provide an unambiguous evaluation of replication.

Existing research on the predictors of compliance with pandemic measures has often produced discrepant results. One explanation for this may be that the determinants of compliance are context specific. Understanding whether this is the case is important for designing public health messaging and for evaluating the generalisability of existing research. We used data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study; a large weekly panel of UK adults from first five months of lockdown in the UK (n = 22,625). We tested whether the extent to which demographic, socio-economic position, personality traits, social and pro-social motivations, and the living environment predict compliance changed across the pandemic using multilevel regression modelling. Low compliance was strongly related to younger age and also to risk attitudes, empathic concern, and high income, among other factors. The size of some of these associations was larger in later months when less stringent lockdown and household mixing measures were in place. The results showed that compliance was lower and fell faster across some groups, suggesting the importance that public health communications adopt a plurality of messages to maximize broad adherence.

Particularly, the cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei (BFCN), the source of cortical cholinergic innervation, support multiple cognitive functions, ranging from attention to decision-making. We hypothesized that BFCN structural integrity is altered in schizophrenia and associated with patientsâ attentional deficits. We assessed gray matter (GM) integrity of cytoarchitectonically defined BFCN region-of-interest in 72 patients with schizophrenia and 73 healthy controls, matched for age and gender, from the COBRE open-source database, via structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)âbased volumetry. MRI-derived measures of GM integrity (i.e., volumes) were linked with performance on a symbol coding task (SCT), a paper-pencil-based metric that assesses attention, by correlation and mediation analysis. To assess the replicability of findings, we repeated the analyses in an independent dataset comprising 26 patients with schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy controls. BFCN volumes were lower in patients (t(139)=2.51, p = 0.01) and significantly associated with impaired SCT performance (r = 0.31, p = 0.01). Furthermore, lower BFCN volumes mediated the group difference in SCT performance. When including global GM volumes, which were lower in patients, as covariates-of-no-interest, these findings disappeared, indicating that schizophrenia did not have a specific effect on BFCN relative to other regional volume changes. We replicated these findings in the independent cohort, e.g., BFCN volumes were lower in patients and mediated patientsâ impaired SCT performance. Results demonstrate lower BFCN volumes in schizophrenia, which link with patientsâ attentional deficits. Data suggest that a dysregulated cholinergic system might contribute to cognitive difficulties in schizophrenia via impaired BFCN.

Nevertheless, studies applying easily replicable weighted scores to neuroimaging data are lacking. Our aim was to assess the reliability and validity of the Neuroimaging Association Score (NAS), which combines information from structural brain features previously linked to mental disorders. Participants were 726 youth (aged 6â14) from two cities in Brazil who underwent MRI and psychopathology assessment at baseline and 387 at 3-year follow-up. Results were replicated in two samples: IMAGEN (n = 1627) and the Healthy Brain Network (n = 843). NAS were derived by summing the product of each standardized brain feature by the effect size of the association of that brain feature with seven psychiatric disorders documented by previous meta-analyses. NAS were calculated for surface area, cortical thickness and subcortical volumes using T1-weighted scans. NAS reliability, temporal stability and psychopathology and cognition prediction were analyzed. NAS for surface area showed high internal consistency and 3-year stability and predicted general psychopathology and cognition with higher replicability than specific symptomatic domains for all samples. They also predicted general psychopathology with higher replicability than single structures alone, accounting for 1â3% of the variance, but without directionality. The NAS for cortical thickness and subcortical volumes showed lower internal consistency and less replicable associations with behavioural phenotypes. These findings indicate the NAS based on surface area might be replicable markers of general psychopathology, but these links are unlikely to be causal or clinically useful yet.

Stein, Yilu Wang, Don A. Moore and Leif D. Nelson (PNAS Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 2021[Nov][1], Vol 118[44][e2103313118]). In the original article, there were some methodological errors due to some discrepancies between the materials the authors used in their replication attempts and the original materials. The details for these corrections are all present in the erratum. The corrected Fig. 1 and its legend are also present in the erratum. The SI Appendix has been updated, as well as the article text to reflect the corrections described. Additionally, a reference was omitted from the article. The complete reference appears in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2022-03378-001[/rid]). Empirical audit and review is an approach to assessing the evidentiary value of a research area. It involves identifying a topic and selecting a cross-section of studies for replication. We apply the method to research on the psychological consequences of scarcity. Starting with the papers citing a seminal publication in the field, we conducted replications of 20 studies that evaluate the role of scarcity priming in pain sensitivity, resource allocation, materialism, and many other domains. There was considerable variability in the replicability, with some strong successes and other undeniable failures. Empirical audit and review does not attempt to assign an overall replication rate for a heterogeneous field, but rather facilitates researchers seeking to incorporate strength of evidence as they refine theories and plan new investigations in the research area. This method allows for an integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches to review and enables the growth of a cumulative science.

We conducted very close replications of two classic experiments of hindsight bias and a conceptual replication testing hindsight bias regarding the perceived replicability of hindsight bias. In Study 1 (N = 890), we replicated Experiment 2 in Fischhoff (1975), and found support for hindsight bias in retrospective judgments (dmean = 0.60). In Study 2 (N = 608), we replicated Experiment 1 in Slovic and Fischhoff (1977), and found support for hindsight bias in prospective judgments (dmean = 0.40). In Study 3 (N = 520) we found strong support for hindsight bias regarding perceived likelihood of our replication of hindsight bias (d = 0.43â1.03). We also included extensions examining surprise, confidence, and task difficulty, yet found mixed evidence with weak to no effects. We concluded support for hindsight bias in both retrospective and prospective judgments, and in evaluations of replication findings, and therefore call for establishing measures to address hindsight bias in valuations of replication work and interpreting research outcomes.

While generalisation is common in quantitative research, there is a lack of generalisability in qualitative research. This paper presents the experience and challenges faced by the Designing for People with Dementia (MinD) project in meeting the requirements to strengthen the generalisation of findings on the lived experience of people living with dementia and their engagement to co-create designs to empower their everyday living. Â  Methods : Polit and Beck (2010)'s strategies to generalise qualitative findings were applied: (1) replication in sampling; (2) replication of studies; (3) meta-synthesis of findings; (4) reflexivity and conceptualization; (5) immersion with the data; and (6) thick description. Results : While it is possible to increase the generabilisabilty of qualitative evidence through the replication of the sampling to attain a large, heterogeneous sample in different and multiple contexts and environments; implementation of sound and robust research; conducting in-depth analysis and interpretation collaboratively for emergent themes; and meeting the thick description requirement, there are challenges that the project team faced in implementing some of the Polit and Beck's strategies because of the condition, namely dementia, that our participants are having. Other challenges faced were: the language and cultural diversity in the team; diverseÂ  work and organisational procedures; and the inter-disciplinary differences relating to the methods of enquiry, approaches and techniques to conduct research. These challenges will need to be identified and addressed at the start of the project with a strong leadership to ensure a seamless journey to complete the project successfully. Trust between the researchers and participants, and time to build this trust are critical to recruitment and participation in the study; these factors are of utmost important in research involving participants with condition such as dementia.; Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

Among them, a prominent place belongs to replication studies. However the authors aiming to critically evaluate conducted replications or to conduct a replication study themselves needs to explicitly reflect two crucial issues. The first regards conditions that need to be met in order to consider the second study as a replication of the first. This concerns the definition of replication and broader categorization of replication types from a methodological point of view, reflecting various conceptual and terminological issues. The second regards conditions that need to be met in order to say that the results of the replication study replicated/did not replicate the original study. This involves the way in which the study is statistically analysed with respect to its main goal. Therefore, the aim of the present article is to discuss and to summarize the present state of the literature regarding these two issues and to synthesize it into two functional classifications: A, various types of replications from a methodological point of view; B, various possibilities of data analysis from a statistical point of view. It is argued that instead of non-critically preferring one specific approach, the researcher should reflect the pros and cons of various approaches and the broader context of the goal of the replication study.

These assessments have used different statistical approaches to determine if a finding has been replicated. The purpose of this article is to provide several alternative conceptual frameworks that lead to different statistical analyses to test hypotheses about replication. All of these analyses are based on statistical methods used in meta-analysis. The differences among the methods described involve whether the burden of proof is placed on replication or nonreplication, whether replication is exact or allows for a small amount of 'negligible heterogeneity,' and whether the studies observed are assumed to be fixed (constituting the entire body of relevant evidence) or are a sample from a universe of possibly relevant studies. The statistical power of each of these tests is computed and shown to be low in many cases, raising issues of the interpretability of tests for replication.

Previous work has shown that the LST elicits typical reasoning complexity effects, such that increases in complexity are associated with decrements in task accuracy and increases in response times. Here we modified the LST for use in functional brain imaging experiments, in which presentation durations must be strictly controlled, and assessed its validity and reliability. Modifications included presenting the components within each trial serially, such that the reasoning and response periods were separated. In addition, the inspection time for each LST problem was constrained to five seconds. We replicated previous findings of higher error rates and slower response times with increasing relational complexity and observed relatively large effect sizes (Î·2p &gt; 0.70, r &gt; .50). Moreover, measures of internal consistency and test-retest reliability confirmed the stability of the LST within and across separate testing sessions. Interestingly, we found that limiting the inspection time for individual problems in the LST had little effect on accuracy relative to the unconstrained times used in previous work, a finding that is important for future brain imaging experiments aimed at investigating the neural correlates of relational reasoning.

In the original article, there were some methodological errors due to some discrepancies between the materials the authors used in their replication attempts and the original materials. The details for these corrections are all present in the erratum. The corrected Fig. 1 and its legend are also present in the erratum. The SI Appendix has been updated, as well as the article text to reflect the corrections described. Additionally, a reference was omitted from the article. The complete reference appears in the erratum.] Empirical audit and review is an approach to assessing the evidentiary value of a research area. It involves identifying a topic and selecting a cross-section of studies for replication. We apply the method to research on the psychological consequences of scarcity. Starting with the papers citing a seminal publication in the field, we conducted replications of 20 studies that evaluate the role of scarcity priming in pain sensitivity, resource allocation, materialism, and many other domains. There was considerable variability in the replicability, with some strong successes and other undeniable failures. Empirical audit and review does not attempt to assign an overall replication rate for a heterogeneous field, but rather facilitates researchers seeking to incorporate strength of evidence as they refine theories and plan new investigations in the research area. This method allows for an integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches to review and enables the growth of a cumulative science.

We investigated genetic loci previously implicated in Tourette syndrome and associated disorders in interaction with pre- and perinatal adversity in relation to tic severity using a case-only (N = 518) design. We assessed 98 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from (I) top SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of TS; (II) top SNPs from GWASs of obsessiveâcompulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD); (III) SNPs previously implicated in candidate-gene studies of TS; (IV) SNPs previously implicated in OCD or ASD; and (V) tagging SNPs in neurotransmitter-related candidate genes. Linear regression models were used to examine the main effects of the SNPs on tic severity, and the interaction effect of these SNPs with a cumulative pre- and perinatal adversity score. Replication was sought for SNPs that met the threshold of significance (after correcting for multiple testing) in a replication sample (N = 678). One SNP (rs7123010), previously implicated in a TS meta-analysis, was significantly related to higher tic severity. We found a geneâenvironment interaction for rs6539267, another top TS GWAS SNP. These findings were not independently replicated. Our study highlights the future potential of TS GWAS top hits in geneâenvironment studies.

How such cross-talker generalization is achieved has remained an open question. In a seminal study, Bradlow &amp; Bent (2008, henceforth BB08) found that exposure to just 5 min of accented speech can elicit improved recognition that generalizes to an unfamiliar talker of the same accent (N = 70 participants). Cross-talker generalization was, however, only observed after exposure to multiple talkers of the accent, not after exposure to a single accented talker. This contrast between single- and multitalker exposure has been highly influential beyond research on speech perception, suggesting a critical role of exposure variability in learning and generalization. We assess the replicability of BB08âs findings in two large-scale perception experiments (total N = 640) including 20 unique combinations of exposure and test talkers. Like BB08, we find robust evidence for cross-talker generalization after multitalker exposure. Unlike BB08, we also find evidence for generalization after single-talker exposure. The degree of cross-talker generalization depends on the specific combination of exposure and test talker. This and other recent findings suggest that exposure to cross-talker variability is not necessary for cross-talker generalization. Variability during exposure might affect generalization only indirectly, mediated through the informativeness of exposure about subsequent speech during test: Similarity-based inferences can explain both the original BB08 and the present findings. We present Bayesian data analysis, including Bayesian meta-analyses and replication tests for generalized linear mixed models.

Past research suggests that CT might alter stress processing with a subsequent negative impact on mental health. However, it is currently unclear how different domains of CT exert effects on specific subjective experiences of stress during adulthood. Methods: In the present study, we used network analysis to explore the complex interplay between distinct domains of CT and perceived stress in a large, general-population sample of middle-aged adults (N = 1252). We used a data-driven community-detection algorithm to identify strongly connected subgroups of items within the network. To assess the replicability of the findings, we repeated the analyses in a second sample (N = 862). Combining data from both samples, we evaluated network differences between men (n = 955) and women (n = 1159). Results: Results indicate specific associations between distinct domains of CT and perceived stress. CT domains reflecting a dimension of deprivation, i.e. experiences of neglect, were associated exclusively to a stress network community representing low perceived self-efficacy. By contrast, CT associated with threat, i.e. experiences of abuse, was specifically related to a stress community reflecting perceived helplessness. Our results replicated with high accordance in the second sample. We found no difference in network structure between men and women, but overall a stronger connected network in women. Conclusions: Our findings emphasize the unique role of distinct domains of CT in psychological stress processes in adulthood, implying opportunities for targeted interventions following distinct domains of CT.

However, it is uncertain whether everyday care of elderly patients with dementia is sufficiently captured in contemporary research. Objective: To systematically review contemporary dementia research in terms of study and patient characteristics in order to assess generalizability of research findings. Evidence review: PubMed was searched for dementia studies published in the top 100 journals in the fields of neurology and neuroscience, geriatrics, psychiatry, and general medicine between September 1, 2018, and August 31, 2019. Two reviewers extracted study characteristics, including setting, number of participants, age at diagnosis, and use of biomarkers. Findings: Among 513 identified studies, 211 (41%) included fewer than 50 individuals with dementia and were excluded. The remaining 302 studies included a median (interquartile range) of 214 patients (98-628) with a mean (SD) age at diagnosis of 74.1 years (8.0). Age at diagnosis differed with study setting. Patients in the 180 clinic-based studies had a mean (SD) age of 71.8 (6.4) years at time of diagnosis compared with 80.6 (4.7) years among patients in the 79 population-based studies (mean difference, 8.8 years; 95% CI, 7.3-10.2). Use of magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid imaging was mostly done in clinic-based studies (80% to 96%) and consequently in relatively young patients (mean [SD] age, 71.6 [5.1] years). A longitudinal design was more common in population-based studies than in clinic-based studies (82 % vs 40%). Most studies originated from North America and Europe (89%), including almost exclusively White participants (among 74 studies [22%] reporting on ethnicity: median [interquartile range], 89% [78-97]). The 3 most studied cohorts represented 21% of all included study populations. Conclusions and relevance: Contemporary dementia research is limited in terms of racial and geographic diversity and draws largely from clinic-based populations with relatively young patients. Greater inclusivity and deeper phenotyping in unselected cohorts could improve generalizability as well as diagnosis and development of effective treatments for all patients with dementia.

A growing body of work suggests that coalition network ties, which facilitate transmission of information and advocacy, may be a key part of how such leadership operates. This study provides an understanding of the structure of coalition networks and how this structure changes over time. Methods: We administered semiannual network surveys during a pilot whole-of-community intervention in Somerville, MA (2015â2017). Participants included 16 multisector coalition members and their nominated discussion partners ('first-degree alters') related to childhood obesity prevention. Coalition and first-degree alter respondents named up to 20 discussion partners and reported ties' interaction frequency and perceived influence. Networks were assessed with visualization, descriptive analysis, and exponential random graph models. Results: Total network included 558 stakeholders representing community-based organizations, parents, health care, childcare, universities, among others. Size and membership varied over time. We observed the largest network (n = 256) during intervention planning, and the largest proportion of stakeholders communicating frequently (daily/weekly) about childhood obesity prevention during the peak intervention period. Networks were sparsely interconnected (1%â3% of possible ties observed) and most and least centralized at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Over time, ties were increasingly perceived as influential and siloed within community groups. Conclusions: The network's extensive evolving membership may indicate access to a wide range of resources, ideas, and an ability to broadly disseminate intervention messages. The attenuating network hierarchy over time may have supported more equal participation and control over intervention efforts. Future research should assess generalizability of network patterns, network influences on implementation processes, and possible network interventions.

Included articles were assessed for fidelity to the original study using 5 categories: Identical, Substitutable, In-class, Augmented, and Out-of-class; and 7 IMPISCO domains: Investigators (I), Method (M), Population (P), Intervention (I), Setting (S), Comparator (C), and Outcome (O). A fidelity score and heat map were generated using the ratings.; Results: From 4063 publications matching search criteria for CDSS research, only 12/4063 (0.3%) were ultimately identified as replications. Six articles replicated but could not reproduce the results of the Han et al (2005) CPOE study showing mortality increase and, over time, changed from truth testing to generalizing this result. Other replications successfully tested variants of CDSS technology (2/12) or validated measurement instruments (4/12).; Discussion: A replication rate of 3 in a thousand studies is low even by the low rates in other disciplines. Several new reporting methods were developed for this study, including the IMPISCO framework, fidelity scores, and fidelity heat maps. A reporting structure for clearly identifying replication research is also proposed.; Conclusion: There is an urgent need to better characterize which core CDSS principles require replication, identify past replication data, and conduct missing replication studies. Attention to replication should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CDSS research and avoiding potentially harmful trial and error technology deployment. (Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Thirty journals met the inclusion criteria. From January 1, 2014-December 31, 2018, 300 publications were randomly sampled using a PubMed search. Additionally, we included four high-impact general medicine journals, which added 106 publications. Two investigators were blinded for independent extraction. Extracted data included statements regarding the availability of materials, data, analysis scripts, protocols, and registration.; Results: After the search, we found 25,473 articles, from which we randomly selected 300. Of the 300, only 287 articles met the inclusion criteria. Additionally, we added 106 publications from high-impact journals of which 77 met the inclusion criteria. Together, 364 publications were included, of which 212 articles contained empirical data to analyze. Of the eligible empirical articles, 2.49%, (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33% to 4.64%] provided a material statement, 9.91% (95% CI, 5.88% to 13.93%) provided a data statement, 0 provided access to analysis scripts, 25.94% (95% CI, 20.04% to 31.84%) linked the protocol, and 39.15% (95% CI, 32.58% to 45.72%) were preregistered.; Conclusion: Studies in EM lack indicators required for reproducibility. The majority of studies fail to report factors needed to reproduce research to ensure credibility. Thus, an intervention is required and can be achieved through the collaboration of researchers, peer reviewers, funding agencies, and journals.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=35353995&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Yunfeng</author><author>Sinke, Lucy</author><author>Jonkman, Thomas H</author><author>Slieker, Roderick C</author><author>van Zwet, Erik W</author><author>Daxinger, Lucia</author><author>Heijmans, Bastiaan T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The inactive X chromosome accumulates widespread epigenetic variability with age.</title><secondary-title>Clinical epigenetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical epigenetics</full-title><abbr-1>Clinical epigenetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>135</pages><volume>15</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aging</keyword><keyword>Aging/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA methylation</keyword><keyword>DNA Methylation*</keyword><keyword>Epigenesis, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene expression</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Variance</keyword><keyword>Women</keyword><keyword>X chromosome</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome Inactivation</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-08-25</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1868-7083</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13148-023-01549-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Loss of epigenetic control is a hallmark of aging. Among the most prominent roles of epigenetic mechanisms is the inactivation of one of two copies of the X chromosome in females through DNA methylation. Hence, age-related disruption of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) may contribute to the aging process in women.; Methods: We analyzed 9,777 CpGs on the X chromosome in whole blood samples from 2343 females and 1688 males (Illumina 450k methylation array) and replicated findings in duplicate using one whole blood and one purified monocyte data set (in total, 991/924 females/males). We used double generalized linear models to detect age-related differentially methylated CpGs (aDMCs), whose mean methylation level differs with age, and age-related variably methylated CpGs (aVMCs), whose methylation level becomes more variable with age.; Results: In females, aDMCs were relatively uncommon (nâ=â33) and preferentially occurred in regions known to escape XCI. In contrast, many CpGs (nâ=â987) were found to display an increased variance with age (aVMCs). Of note, the replication rate of aVMCs was also high in purified monocytes (94%), indicating an independence of cell composition. aVMCs accumulated in CpG islands and regions subject to XCI suggesting that they stemmed from the inactive X. In males, carrying an active copy of the X chromosome only, aDMCs (nâ=â316) were primarily driven by cell composition, while aVMCs replicated well (95%) but were infrequent (nâ=â37).; Conclusions: Our results imply that age-related DNA methylation differences at the inactive X chromosome are dominated by the accumulation of variability.

This study attempted to investigate the role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in HBV replication. Cells were treated with 1.3 folds of HBV genome. The expression patterns of HDAC3, miR-29a-3p, and nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) in cells were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. HBV replication was assessed by measurements of HBV DNA, HBV RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis B E antigen. After chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays to testify gene interactions, rescue experiments and animal experiments were performed to assess the role of miR-29a-3p/NFAT5 in HBV replication and the role of HDAC3 inÂ vivo. HDAC3 level was decreased by pHBV1.3 plasmid in a concentration-dependent manner. HDAC3 overexpression can inhibit HBV replication, which was neutralized by miR-29a-3p overexpression or NFAT5 downregulation. Mechanically, HDAC3 overexpression reduced the enrichment of histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation on the miR-29a-3p promoter to inhibit miR-29a-3p expression and then promote NFAT5 transcription. InÂ vivo, HDAC3 restrained HBV replication through the miR-29a-3p/NFAT5 axis. Overall, HDAC3 downregulation was associated with HBV replication and HDAC3 overexpression inhibited HBV replication through H3K9ac/miR-29a-3p/NFAT5.; Competing Interests: Declaration of competing interest The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

The international prevention system Communities That Care (CTC) addresses these challenges. CTC aims to prevent alcohol and drug abuse, violence, delinquency, school dropout, and depressive symptoms among adolescents with aÂ systemic multi-level strategy. The evidence-based and cost-effective prevention system developed in the USA was adapted to Germany; at present, aÂ replication study evaluates the cost-effectiveness.CTC is based on empirical theory and follows aÂ five-phase process model. Essential for acceptance and evidence-based implementation is the formation of an intersectoral coalition, whose members receive advisory support and training over several years. The actors are empowered to use aÂ system change model at the municipal level and to implement it in the long term. The aim is to select evidence-based measures in aÂ data-driven and needs-oriented manner and to implement them in consideration of the local contextual conditions in order to reduce risk factors, promote protective factors, and thus improve the health of adolescents. Validated instruments such as the CTC Children and Youth Survey and aÂ registry with evidence-based prevention programs ("GrÃ¼ne Liste PrÃ¤vention") support the process.As aÂ systemic intervention, CTC integrates existing local structures and agencies and involves them in the entire process through new decision-making and development bodies. In this way, the potential in the municipality is used and, as much as possible, resources are bundled, strengths are developed, and transparency is created. (Â© 2023.

Coders compared stimuli, material, design, and statistical analysis to pilot treatment approaches. Each study was coded as direct, conceptual, failed, or no replication.; Results: Eighteen treatment approaches were selected for this review. A total of 188 articles met the inclusion criteria. Results revealed that 14 out of 18 treatment approaches were somehow replicated. Direct replications as the most valuable replication type for affirming previously found results were represented in only 1.5% of all studies (3/188). Failed direct replication were at 2% overall (4/188). Conceptual replications were more common across treatment approaches, but also represented at a low level with 22.8% (43/188). The majority of studies were coded as no replication attempt with 73.4%.; Discussion: A critical factor in developing an evidence-based practice is the existence of replicated results for treatment. Replication evaluates the reproducibility of an author's or authors' research methodology and resulting outcomes and helps to ensure that observed treatment effects are reproducible. For an evidence-based treatment to be implemented or used in any clinical setting, it must be one that can be replicated. Direct and conceptual replications of aphasia treatment approaches were found to be alarmingly low considering the importance of replication in our field. It is recommended that replication should become more valued and mainstreamed in aphasia research. A replication database that compiles and maintains treatment manuals for replication purposes can increase the accessibility and acceptability of replications for researchers.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=36596266&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Zhanliang</author><author>Lei, Yunwen</author><author>KabÃ¡n, Ata</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimization and Learning With Randomly Compressed Gradient Updates.</title><secondary-title>Neural computation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neural computation</full-title><abbr-1>Neural computation</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1234-1287</pages><volume>35</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-06-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1530-888X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1162/neco_a_01588</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Gradient descent methods are simple and efficient optimization algorithms with widespread applications. To handle high-dimensional problems, we study compressed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with low-dimensional gradient updates. We provide a detailed analysis in terms of both optimization rates and generalization rates. To this end, we develop uniform stability bounds for CompSGD for both smooth and nonsmooth problems, based on which we develop almost optimal population risk bounds. Then we extend our analysis to two variants of SGD: batch and mini-batch gradient descent. Furthermore, we show that these variants achieve almost optimal rates compared to their high-dimensional gradient setting. Thus, our results provide a way to reduce the dimension of gradient updates without affecting the convergence rate in the generalization analysis. Moreover, we show that the same result also holds in the differentially private setting, which allows us to reduce the dimension of added noise with "almost free" cost.

Open science practices include study pre-registration, open data, open access, and avoiding methods that can lead to publication bias and low replication rates. Although gambling studies uses similar research methods as behavioral research fields that have struggled with replication, we know little about the uptake of open science research practices in gambling-focused research. We conducted a scoping review of 500 recent (1/1/2016-12/1/2019) studies focused on gambling and problem gambling to examine the use of open science and transparent research practices. Our results showed that a small percentage of studies used most practices: whereas 54.6% (95% CI: [50.2, 58.9]) of studies used at least one of nine open science practices, each practice's prevalence was: 1.6% for pre-registration (95% CI:Â [0.8, 3.1]), 3.2% for open data (95% CI:Â [2.0, 5.1]), 0% for open notebook, 35.2% for open access (95% CI:Â [31.1, 39.5]), 7.8% for open materials (95% CI:Â [5.8, 10.5]), 1.4% for open code (95% CI:Â [0.7, 2.9]), and 15.0% for preprint posting (95% CI:Â [12.1, 18.4]). In all, 6.4% (95% CI:Â [4.6, 8.9])Â of the studies included a power analysis and 2.4% (95% CI:Â [1.4, 4.2]) were replication studies. Exploratory analyses showed that studies that used any open science practice, and open access in particular, had higher citation counts. We suggest several practical ways to enhance the uptake of open science principles and practices both within gambling studies and in science more generally. (Â© 2022.

Researchers have successfully taught parents to implement this intervention package using behavioral skills training (BST). Although effective, BST is an intensive teaching strategy and the generality of the effects of training on parent and child behavior have not been assessed. The current study conducted a component analysis of the elements of BST (written instructions, modeling, and rehearsal with performance feedback) to determine the sufficient and necessary elements of training needed to teach parents to implement three-step prompting and DRA. Further, we assessed generalization of parentsâ skills across multiple instructional contexts with their children. The results indicated that the full BST package was necessary for parents to reach mastery levels of correct implementation, but training generalized across untargeted tasks.

Practitioners attempting to appropriately adapt mental healthcare and therapy provision report low confidence and inconsistency in their approach. This study contributes to the guidance by providing a shortlist of usable and priority adaptations for diagnostic and therapy services as described by multidisciplinary staff members responsible for the design and delivery of a specialist autism service in the UK. Individual freelisting interviews were conducted with 15 staff, who were asked to list the ways that they adapt their practice individually, within therapy, and collectively as a service. Salience and cultural consensus analyses demonstrated the following agreed priority service adaptations: ensuring the suitability of the service environment with consideration of sensory demands, adapting communication, knowing individual gender identity preferences and minimising client uncertainty. Detailed examples are given for flexibly adapting therapy to individual needs to inform general and specialist services. The findings require replication and evaluation.

This sense allows newborns to develop different behaviors that will allow them to survive. Odors tend to be associated to contextual stimuli (such as warmth); this, in turn, enables the pups to recognize when to withdraw or approach. At the same time, olfaction modulates the acceptance of aversive flavors. The increase of approach responses toward a bitter substance during early life is enhanced by stimulation with familiar, pre-exposed odors. Newborn rats exhibit heightened grasp responses toward an artificial nipple dispensing quinine, and drink more of this bitter solution, in the presence of a pre-exposed odor (lemon or the mother's odor). The present research assessed the replicability of previous results by pre-exposing the subjects to the scent through maternal milk and using solutions with different aversive tastes. Half of the subjects (3 day-old Wistar rats) were pre-exposed to lemon odor through the maternal milk (the mother had previously ingested the lemon essence via an intragastric injection); 4 h later, all the rats were evaluated in the presence of the lemon odor with an artificial nipple containing quinine, citric acid, saline solution, or water. The results showed enhanced seeking and intake of the bitter (quinine) and sour solution (citric acid). However, this did not occur when the nipple contained water or saline solution. The evidence suggests that: During the early stages of development, familiar odors regulate the acceptance of non-palatable, otherwise rejected, flavors; and that the route of transmission of the pre-exposed odor can be through air, or through food (amniotic fluid in previous studies and, in this case, breast milk), that is, via the retronasal and orthonasal routes.

It is just as critical to explore these issues in syntheses of studies, such as systematic reviews, given their influence on decision-making and future research. We aim to explore various aspects relating to the transparency, reproducibility and replicability of several components of systematic reviews with meta-analysis of the effects of health, social, behavioural and educational interventions.; Methods: The REPRISE (REProducibility and Replicability In Syntheses of Evidence) project consists of four studies. We will evaluate the completeness of reporting and sharing of review data, analytic code and other materials in a random sample of 300 systematic reviews of interventions published in 2020 (Study 1). We will survey authors of systematic reviews to explore their views on sharing review data, analytic code and other materials and their understanding of and opinions about replication of systematic reviews (Study 2). We will then evaluate the extent of variation in results when we (a) independently reproduce meta-analyses using the same computational steps and analytic code (if available) as used in the original review (Study 3), and (b) crowdsource teams of systematic reviewers to independently replicate a subset of methods (searches for studies, selection of studies for inclusion, collection of outcome data, and synthesis of results) in a sample of the original reviews; 30 reviews will be replicated by 1 team each and 2 reviews will be replicated by 15 teams (Study 4).; Discussion: The REPRISE project takes a systematic approach to determine how reliable systematic reviews of interventions are. We anticipate that results of the REPRISE project will inform strategies to improve the conduct and reporting of future systematic reviews.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=33863381&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, C A</author><author>Nolan, J</author><author>Tritz, D J</author><author>Heavener, T E</author><author>Pelton, J</author><author>Cook, K</author><author>Vassar, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of reproducible and transparent research practices in pulmonology.</title><secondary-title>Pulmonology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pulmonology</full-title><abbr-1>Pulmonology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>134-143</pages><volume>27</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Biomedical Research/*ethics</keyword><keyword>Biomedical Research/economics</keyword><keyword>Biomedical Research/statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Data Management</keyword><keyword>Evidence-based medicine</keyword><keyword>Evidence-Based Medicine</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Meta-Analysis as Topic</keyword><keyword>Publications/economics</keyword><keyword>Publications/statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Medicine/*standards</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Medicine/statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>Pulmonology</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of results</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results*</keyword><keyword>Systematic Reviews as Topic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2531-0437</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.pulmoe.2020.07.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Study reproducibility is valuable for validating or refuting results. Provision of reproducibility indicators, such as materials, protocols, and raw data in a study improve its potential for reproduction. Efforts to reproduce noteworthy studies in the biomedical sciences have resulted in an overwhelming majority of them being found to be unreplicable, causing concern for the integrity of research in other fields, including medical specialties. Here, we analyzed the reproducibility of studies in the field of pulmonology.; Methods: 500 pulmonology articles were randomly selected from an initial PubMed search for data extraction. Two authors scoured these articles for reproducibility indicators including materials, protocols, raw data, analysis scripts, inclusion in systematic reviews, and citations by replication studies as well as other factors of research transparency including open accessibility, funding source and competing interest disclosures, and study preregistration.; Findings: Few publications included statements regarding materials (10%), protocols (1%), data (15%), and analysis script (0%) availability. Less than 10% indicated preregistration. More than half of the publications analyzed failed to provide a funding statement. Conversely, 63% of the publications were open access and 73% included a conflict of interest statement.; Interpretation: Overall, our study indicates pulmonology research is currently lacking in efforts to increase replicability. Future studies should focus on providing sufficient information regarding materials, protocols, raw data, and analysis scripts, among other indicators, for the sake of clinical decisions that depend on replicable or refutable results from the primary literature.

This article addresses these concerns by presenting the methodological foundations for a replication science. It provides an introduction to the causal replication framework, which defines 'replication' as a research design that tests whether two (or more) studies produce the same causal effect within the limits of sampling error. The framework formalizes the conditions under which replication success can be expected, and allows for the causal interpretation of replication failures. Through two applied examples, the article demonstrates how the causal replication framework may be utilized to plan prospective replication designs, as well as to interpret results from existing replication efforts.

In this Tutorial, we explain model generalizability through the statistical concept of model overfitting and its outcome (i.e., validity shrinkage in new samples), and we use a Shiny app to simulate and visualize how model generalizability is influenced by three factors: model complexity, sample size, and effect size. We then discuss cross-validation as an approach for evaluating model generalizability and provide guidelines for implementing this approach. To help researchers understand how to apply cross-validation to their own research, we walk through an example, accompanied by step-by-step illustrations in R.

Sleep spindles are important brain waves associated with sleep protection and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. The present study tested whether sleep spindles are altered in individuals with PTSD and whether the findings are reproducible across nights and subsamples of the study. Methods: Seventy-eight combat-exposed veteran men with (n = 31) and without (n = 47) PTSD completed two consecutive nights of high-density EEG recordings in a laboratory. We identified slow (10â13 Hz) and fast (13â16 Hz) sleep spindles during N2 and N3 sleep stages and performed topographical analyses of spindle parameters (amplitude, duration, oscillatory frequency, and density) on both nights. To assess reproducibility, we used the first 47 consecutive participants (18 with PTSD) for initial discovery and the remaining 31 participants (13 with PTSD) for replication assessment. Results: In the discovery analysis, compared to non-PTSD participants, PTSD participants exhibited (1) higher slow-spindle oscillatory frequency over the antero-frontal regions on both nights and (2) higher fast-spindle oscillatory frequency over the centro-parietal regions on the second night. The first finding was preserved in the replication analysis. We found no significant group differences in the amplitude, duration, or density of slow or fast spindles. Conclusions: The elevated spindle oscillatory frequency in PTSD may indicate a deficient sensory-gating mechanism responsible for preserving sleep continuity. Our findings, if independently validated, may assist in the development of sleep-focused PTSD diagnostics and interventions.

Batch effects can mask true biological results and/or result in irreproducible conclusions and interpretations. Low biomass samples in microbiome research are prone to reagent contamination; yet, quality control procedures for low biomass samples in large-scale microbiome studies are not well established.; Results: In this study, we have proposed a framework for an in-depth step-by-step approach to address this gap. The framework consists of three independent stages: (1) verification of sequencing accuracy by assessing technical repeatability and reproducibility of the results using mock communities and biological controls; (2) contaminant removal and batch variability correction by applying a two-tier strategy using statistical algorithms (e.g. decontam) followed by comparison of the data structure between batches; and (3) corroborating the repeatability and reproducibility of microbiome composition and downstream statistical analysis. Using this approach on the milk microbiota data from the CHILD Cohort generated in two batches (extracted and sequenced in 2016 and 2019), we were able to identify potential reagent contaminants that were missed with standard algorithms and substantially reduce contaminant-induced batch variability. Additionally, we confirmed the repeatability and reproducibility of our results in each batch before merging them for downstream analysis.; Conclusion: This study provides important insight to advance quality control efforts in low biomass microbiome research. Within-study quality control that takes advantage of the data structure (i.e. differential prevalence of contaminants between batches) would enhance the overall reliability and reproducibility of research in this field.

Further, it is unclear whether dogs can be trained to discriminate between similar concentration variations of an odorant. Four dogs were trained to an odorant (0.01 air dilution of isoamyl acetate) in an air-dilution olfactometer, and we assessed spontaneous generalization to a range of concentrations lower than the training stimulus (Generalization Test 1). Dogs generalized to odors within a 10-fold range of the training odorant. Next, we conducted discrimination training to suppress responses to concentrations lower than a concentration dogs showed initial responding towards in Generalization Test 1 (0.0025 air dilution). Dogs successfully discriminated between 0.0025 and 0.01, exceeding 90% accuracy. However, when a second generalization test was conducted (Generalization Test 2), responding at the 0.0025 concentration immediately recovered and was no different than in Generalization Test 1. Dogs were then tested in another generalization test (Compound Discrimination and Generalization) in which generalization probes were embedded within discrimination trials, and dogs showed suppression of responding to the 0.0025 concentration and lower concentrations in this preparation. These data suggest dogs show limited spontaneous generalization across odor concentration and that dogs can be trained to discriminate between similar concentrations of the same odorant. Stimulus control, however, may depend on the negative stimulus, suggesting olfactory concentration generalization may depend on relative stimulus control. These results highlight the importance of considering odor concentration as a dimension for generalization in canine olfactory research.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=33525503&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tackett, Jennifer L.</author><author>McShane, Blakeley B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conceptualizing and evaluating replication across domains of behavioral research</title><secondary-title>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</abbr-1></periodical><volume>41</volume><keywords><keyword>Behavior</keyword><keyword>behavioral research</keyword><keyword>experimental design</keyword><keyword>Experimental Design</keyword><keyword>Experimental Replication</keyword><keyword>methodology</keyword><keyword>Methodology</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-07-27</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0140-525X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0140525X18000882</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We discuss the authors' conceptualization of replication, in particular the false dichotomy of direct versus conceptual replication intrinsic to it, and suggest a broader one that better generalizes to other domains of psychological research.

It combines effect-size estimation with hypothesis testing, assessing the extent to which the replication results are consistent with an effect size big enough to have been detectable in the original study. The approach is demonstrated by examining replications of three well-known findings. Its benefits include the following: (a) differentiating "unsuccessful" replication attempts (i.e., studies yielding p &gt; .05) that are too noisy from those that actively indicate the effect is undetectably different from zero, (b) "protecting" true findings from underpowered replications, and (c) arriving at intuitively compelling inferences in general and for the revisited replications in particular.

Using the Comparative Crime Data File (CCDF), we replicated the original study with data from the two World Wars, as well as 12 smaller wars occurring prior to 1980. Our replication results generally confirmed the hypothesis that wars increase postwar homicide rates, although there were differences in results based on the method of analysis. We then examined the validity of this theory using data on four wars occurring after 1990, but found no support for the legitimation of violence argument. We argue that the null findings encourage theoretical expansion, which is an underappreciated aspect of replication that is just as valuable as empirical validation.

However, the accurate collection and combination of multimodal and behavioural data in a manner that enables reproducibility is challenging and often requires researchers to refine their approaches. This paper presents a direct replication of a multimodal wordlist experiment. Specifically, we use a lowâcost Emotiv EPOCÂ® to acquire electrophysiological measures of brain activity to investigate whether retrieval during learning facilitates the encoding of subsequent learning as measured by performance on recall tests and reflected by changes in alpha wave oscillations. Behavioural results of the wordlist experiment were replicated, but physiological results were not. We conclude the paper by highlighting the challenges faced in terms of replicating the previous work and in attempting to facilitate the reproducibility of our own experiment.

New advances in metabolomics can provide biochemical insights into the early development of obesity, so we aimed to characterize serum metabolites associated with overweight and adiposity in early childhood and to stratify associations by sex.; Methods: Nontargeted metabolite profiling was conducted in the Canadian CHILD birth cohort (discovery cohort) at age 5Â years (nâ=â900) by multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Clinical outcome was defined using novel combined measures of overweight (WHO-standardized body mass indexââ¥â85th percentile) and/or adiposity (waist circumferenceââ¥â90th percentile). Associations between circulating metabolites and child overweight/adiposity (binary and continuous outcomes) were determined by multivariable linear and logistic regression, adjusting for covariates and false discovery rate, and by subsequent sex-stratified analysis. Replication was assessed in an independent replication cohort called FAMILY at age 5Â years (nâ=â456).; Results: In the discovery cohort, each standard deviation (SD) increment of branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, glutamic acid, threonine, and oxoproline was associated with 20-28% increased odds of overweight/adiposity, whereas each SD increment of the glutamine/glutamic acid ratio was associated with 20% decreased odds. All associations were significant in females but not in males in sex-stratified analyses, except for oxoproline that was not significant in either subgroup. Similar outcomes were confirmed in the replication cohort, where associations of aromatic amino acids, leucine, glutamic acid, and the glutamine/glutamic acid ratio with childhood overweight/adiposity were independently replicated.; Conclusions: Our findings show the utility of combining measures of both overweight and adiposity in young children. Childhood overweight/adiposity at age 5Â years has a specific serum metabolic phenotype, with the profile being more prominent in females compared to males. (Â© 2023.

Poor replicability has spurred cultural changes targeted at improving reliability in these disciplines. Given the absence of equivalent replication projects in ecology and evolutionary biology, two inter-related indicators offer the opportunity to retrospectively assess replicability: publication bias and statistical power. This registered report assesses the prevalence and severity of small-study (i.e., smaller studies reporting larger effect sizes) and decline effects (i.e., effect sizes decreasing over time) across ecology and evolutionary biology using 87 meta-analyses comprising 4,250 primary studies and 17,638 effect sizes. Further, we estimate how publication bias might distort the estimation of effect sizes, statistical power, and errors in magnitude (Type M or exaggeration ratio) and sign (Type S). We show strong evidence for the pervasiveness of both small-study and decline effects in ecology and evolution. There was widespread prevalence of publication bias that resulted in meta-analytic means being over-estimated by (at least) 0.12 standard deviations. The prevalence of publication bias distorted confidence in meta-analytic results, with 66% of initially statistically significant meta-analytic means becoming non-significant after correcting for publication bias. Ecological and evolutionary studies consistently had low statistical power (15%) with a 4-fold exaggeration of effects on average (Type M error rates = 4.4). Notably, publication bias reduced power from 23% to 15% and increased type M error rates from 2.7 to 4.4 because it creates a non-random sample of effect size evidence. The sign errors of effect sizes (Type S error) increased from 5% to 8% because of publication bias. Our research provides clear evidence that many published ecological and evolutionary findings are inflated. Our results highlight the importance of designing high-power empirical studies (e.g., via collaborative team science), promoting and encouraging replication studies, testing and correcting for publication bias in meta-analyses, and adopting open and transparent research practices, such as (pre)registration, data- and code-sharing, and transparent reporting.

As NIRS is a relatively recent brain imaging technique, the question of reproducibility has not yet been systematically addressed.; Aim: The current study seeks to test the replicability of effects observed in NIRS experiments assessing young infants' rule-learning ability.; Approach: We conducted meta-analyses and mixed-effects modeling-based inferential statistics to determine whether effect sizes were replicable and comparable in a sample of 23 NIRS studies investigating infants' abilities to process repetition- and diversity-based regularities in linguistic and nonlinguistic auditory and visual sequences. Additionally, we tested whether effect sizes were modulated by different factors such as the age of participants or the laboratory. We obtained NIRS data from 12 published and 11 unpublished studies. The 23 studies involved a total of 487 infants, aged between 0 and 9 months, tested in four different countries (Canada, France, Italy, and USA).; Results: Our most important finding is that study and laboratory were never significant moderators of variation in effect sizes, indicating that results replicated reliably across the different studies and labs included in the sample. We observed small-to-moderate effect sizes, similar to effect sizes found with other neuroimaging and behavioral techniques in the developmental literature. In line with existing findings, effect sizes were modulated by the participants' age and differed across the different regularities tested, with repetition-based regularities giving rise to the strongest effects; in particular, the overall magnitude of this effect in the left temporal region was 0.27 when analyzing the entire dataset.; Conclusions: Meta-analysis is a useful tool for assessing replicability and cross-study variability. Here, we have shown that infant NIRS studies in the language domain replicate robustly across various NIRS machines, testing sites, and developmental populations.

The generalization function is typically assumed to be of Gaussian shape, centered on the planned motion, although more recent studies associate generalization with the actual motion. Because motor learning is thought to involve multiple adaptive processes with different time constants, we hypothesized that these processes have different time-dependent contributions to the generalization. Guided by a model-based approach, the objective of the present study was to experimentally examine these contributions. We first reformulated a validated two-state adaptation model as a combination of weighted motor primitives, each specified as a Gaussian-shaped tuning function. Adaptation in this model is achieved by updating individual weights of the primitives of the fast and slow adaptive process separately. Depending on whether updating occurred in a plan-referenced or a motion-referenced manner, the model predicted distinct contributions to the overall generalization by the slow and fast process. We tested 23 participants in a reach adaptation task, using a spontaneous recovery paradigm consisting of five successive blocks of a long adaptation phase to a viscous force field, a short adaptation phase with the opposite force, and an error-clamp phase. Generalization was assessed in 11 movement directions relative to the trained target direction. Results of our participant population fell within a continuum of evidence for plan-referenced to evidence for motion-referenced updating. This mixture may reflect the differential weighting of explicit and implicit compensation strategies among participants. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Error-based reach adaptation can be modeled by fast and slow adaptive processes. Using a spontaneous recovery paradigm and model-based analyses, we tested how these processes generalize during force-field reach adaptation. Depending on whether the fast and slow adaptive processes operate by crediting the planned or actual motion, the model predicts distinct contributions of them to the overall generalization function. We show that human participants fall within a continuum of evidence for plan-referenced to motion-referenced updating.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=36883742&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ryan, Karen M</author><author>Smyth, Paul</author><author>Blackshields, Gordon</author><author>Kranaster, Laura</author><author>Sartorius, Alexander</author><author>Sheils, Orla</author><author>McLoughlin, Declan M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electroconvulsive Stimulation in Rats Induces Alterations in the Hippocampal miRNome: Translational Implications for Depression.</title><secondary-title>Molecular neurobiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular neurobiology</full-title><abbr-1>Molecular neurobiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1150-1163</pages><volume>60</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Affect</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Depression</keyword><keyword>Depression/genetics</keyword><keyword>Depression/therapy</keyword><keyword>Electroconvulsive stimulation</keyword><keyword>Electroconvulsive therapy</keyword><keyword>Electroconvulsive Therapy*/methods</keyword><keyword>Hippocampus</keyword><keyword>microRNA</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs*/genetics</keyword><keyword>Next-generation sequencing</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1559-1182</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12035-022-03131-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to the development of depression and its treatment. Here, we used the hypothesis-neutral approach of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to gain comprehensive understanding of the effects of a course of electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), the animal model equivalent of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), on rat hippocampal miRNAs. Significant differential expression (pâ&lt;â0.001) of six hippocampal miRNAs was noted following NGS, after correcting for multiple comparisons. Three of these miRNAs were upregulated (miR-132, miR-212, miR-331) and three downregulated (miR-204, miR-483, miR-301a). qRT-PCR confirmed significant changes in four of the six miRNAs (miR-132, miR-212, miR-204, miR-483). miR-483 was also significantly reduced in frontal cortex, though no other significant alterations were noted in frontal cortex, cerebellum, or whole blood. Assessing the translatability of the results, miR-132 and miR-483 were significantly reduced in whole blood samples from medicated patients with depression (nâ=â50) compared to healthy controls (nâ=â45), though ECT had no impact on miRNA levels. Notably, pre-ECT miR-204 levels moderately positively correlated with depression severity at baseline and moderately negatively correlated with mood score reduction post-ECT. miRNAs were also examined in cerebrospinal fluid and serum from a separate cohort of patients (nâ=â8) treated with ECT; no significant changes were noted post-treatment. However, there was a large positive correlation between changes in miR-212 and mood score post-ECT in serum. Though replication studies using larger sample sizes are required, alterations in miRNA expression may be informative about the mechanism of action of ECS/ECT and in turn might give insight into the neurobiology of depression.

The current Phase II mixed-methods treatment study replicates the CRI with four additional participants (using interpretive research) and investigates how it impacts a traditional measure, participantsâ confrontational naming abilities, outside of game play (using multiple-probe single-case experimental design). Method: Four adults with chronic aphasia participated in the study composed of (a) three preparatory sessions, (b) five baseline sessions, (c) 15 CRI sessions with five treatment probes, and (d) six maintenance sessions. A collaborative confrontation naming (CCN) probe (i.e., dependent variable) was administered in each baseline, treatment probe, and maintenance session. Each CRI session (i.e., independent variable) consisted of a photo-matching game with participant and clinician partner taking alternative turns identifying and matching personally relevant treatment cards. CCN probes were scored using a multidimensional rating scale. Fidelity and social validity were also assessed. Results: Replication of the CRI showed successful and consistent referential learning in all four participant pairs. The multiple-probe analysis of CCN revealed a positive treatment effect on naming in three participants indicating that the CRI was efficacious. High fidelity was maintained throughout the study. Social validity interviews revealed positive outcomes and significant impacts of treatment on the participantsâ lives. Conclusion: The CRI demonstrates strong clinical implications for adults with chronic aphasia. Future research exploring the treatment effectiveness and the implementation to a variety of clinical settings is warranted.

As such, there has been a recent increase in studies evaluating visual analysis training procedures. However, past investigations have not evaluated direct and indirect visual analysis training methods with matched instructional content that was systematically designed. Furthermore, training has rarely included assessment of generalization and maintenance of visual analysis skills. The purpose of the current dissertation study was to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of (a) computerâbased training, (b) lecture formats with and (c) without the opportunity to pause, and (d) a noâtraining group to teach visual analysis of AB graphs to university students. To make these formats directly comparable, the instructional content was equated by ensuring information and examples were identical across the three training procedures. Eightyâthree students were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. Results showed that all three training formats produced increases in accurate responding compared to the noâtraining group. Visual analysis skills generalized to novel graphs and maintained approximately 2 weeks following all trainings. These results suggest that structured approaches that are carefully designed to train visual analysis are effective and lead to gains that generalize and maintain in the absence of training.

Several studies have examined cross-sectional relationships between individual symptoms in youth. However, these studies cannot address the directionality of the temporal relationships hypothesized by the network theory. Therefore, we estimated the longitudinal relationships between individual internalizing, externalizing, and attention symptoms in youth. Methods: Data from 4,093 youth participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study were used. Symptoms were assessed using the Brief Problem Monitor, which was administered at three time points spaced six months apart. Unique longitudinal relationships between symptoms at T1 and T2 were estimated using cross-lagged panel network modeling. Network replicability was assessed by comparing this network to an identically estimated replication network of symptoms at T2 predicting symptoms at T3. Results: After controlling for all other symptoms and demographic covariates, depressed mood, inattention, and worry at T1 were most predictive of other symptoms at T2. In contrast, threats of violence and destructiveness at T2 were most prospectively predicted by other symptoms at T1. The reciprocal associations between depressed mood and worthlessness were among the strongest bivariate relationships in the network. Comparisons between the original network and the replication network (correlation between edge lists = .61; individual edge replicability = 64%â84%) suggested moderate replicability. Conclusions: Although causal inferences are precluded by the observational design and methodological considerations, these findings demonstrate the directionality of relationships between individual symptoms in youth and highlight depressed mood, inattention, and worry as potential influencers of other symptoms.

A major replication project found that only 25% of results in social psychology could be replicated. I examine various explanations for this low replication rate and found most of them lacking in empirical support. I then provide evidence that the use of questionable research practices accounts for this result. Using z-curve and a representative sample of focal hypothesis tests, I find that the expected replication rate for social psychology is between 20% and 45%. I argue that quantifying replicability can provide an incentive to use good research practices and to invest more resources in studies that produce replicable results. The replication crisis in social psychology provides important lessons for other disciplines in psychology that have avoided to take a closer look at their research practices.

Unlike in the initial study, no significant differences between NP &gt; AN could be observed. The inconsistency of results and the non-replication of the study could have several reasons, such as high inter-individual variance of functional correlates of emotion processing, as well as intra-individual variances and the smaller group size of the initial study.

If these studies use methods that are unfaithful to the original study or ineffective in eliciting the phenomenon of interest, then a failure to replicate may be a failure of the protocol rather than a challenge to the original finding. Formal pre-data-collection peer review by experts may address shortcomings and increase replicability rates. We selected 10 replication studies from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (RP:P; Open Science Collaboration, 2015) for which the original authors had expressed concerns about the replication designs before data collection; only one of these studies had yielded a statistically significant effect (p &lt; .05). Commenters suggested that lack of adherence to expert review and low-powered tests were the reasons that most of these RP:P studies failed to replicate the original effects. We revised the replication protocols and received formal peer review prior to conducting new replication studies. We administered the RP:P and revised protocols in multiple laboratories (median number of laboratories per original study = 6.5, range = 3â9; median total sample = 1,279.5, range = 276â3,512) for high-powered tests of each original finding with both protocols. Overall, following the preregistered analysis plan, we found that the revised protocols produced effect sizes similar to those of the RP:P protocols (Îr = .002 or .014, depending on analytic approach). The median effect size for the revised protocols (r = .05) was similar to that of the RP:P protocols (r = .04) and the original RP:P replications (r = .11), and smaller than that of the original studies (r = .37). Analysis of the cumulative evidence across the original studies and the corresponding three replication attempts provided very precise estimates of the 10 tested effects and indicated that their effect sizes (median r = .07, range = .00â.15) were 78% smaller, on average, than the original effect sizes (median r = .37, range = .19â.50).

But the estimated average replicability rate of key-effects that top-tier psychology journals report falls between 36 and 39% (objective vs. subjective rate; Open Science Collaboration, 2015). So the standard mode of applying null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) fails to adequately separate stable from random effects. Therefore, NHST does not fully convince as a statistical inference strategy. We argue that the replicability crisis is 'home-made' because more sophisticated strategies can deliver results the successful replication of which is sufficiently probable. Thus, we can overcome the replicability crisis by integrating empirical results into genuine research programs. Instead of continuing to narrowly evaluate only the stability of data against random fluctuations (discovery context), such programs evaluate rival hypotheses against stable data (justification context).

Prediction markets and related methods of eliciting peer beliefs are promising tools to predict replication outcomes. We invited researchers in the field of psychology to judge the replicability of 24 studies replicated in the large scale Many Labs 2 project. We elicited peer beliefs in prediction markets and surveys about two replication success metrics: the probability that the replication yields a statistically significant effect in the original direction (p &lt; 0.001), and the relative effect size of the replication. The prediction markets correctly predicted 75% of the replication outcomes, and were highly correlated with the replication outcomes. Survey beliefs were also significantly correlated with replication outcomes, but had larger prediction errors. The prediction markets for relative effect sizes attracted little trading and thus did not work well. The survey beliefs about relative effect sizes performed better and were significantly correlated with observed relative effect sizes. The results suggest that replication outcomes can be predicted and that the elicitation of peer beliefs can increase our knowledge about scientific reproducibility and the dynamics of hypothesis testing.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=1830511&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horster, Isabelle</author><author>Nickel, Kathrin</author><author>Holovics, Lukas</author><author>Schmidt, Stefan</author><author>Endres, Dominique</author><author>van Elst, Ludger Tebartz</author><author>Zeeck, Almut</author><author>Maier, Simon</author><author>Joos, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A neglected topic in neuroscience: Replicability of fMRI results with specific reference to ANOREXIA NERVOSA</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Psychiatry</full-title><abbr-1>Frontiers in Psychiatry</abbr-1></periodical><volume>11</volume><keywords><keyword>anorexia nervosa</keyword><keyword>Anorexia Nervosa</keyword><keyword>Experimental Replication</keyword><keyword>food</keyword><keyword>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</keyword><keyword>neurobiology</keyword><keyword>Neurobiology</keyword><keyword>replicability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-08-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1664-0640</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00777</electronic-resource-num><abstract>[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 11[599179] of Frontiers in Psychiatry (see record [rid]2020-71589-001[/rid]).

We argue that there are different ways to define 'replication failure,' and that analyses can focus on exploring variation among replication studies or assess whether their results contradict the findings of the original study. We apply this framework to a set of psychological findings that have been replicated and assess the sensitivity of these analyses. We find that tests for replication that involve only a single replication study are almost always severely underpowered. Among the 40 findings for which ensembles of multisite direct replications were conducted, we find that between 11 and 17 (28% to 43%) ensembles produced heterogeneous effects, depending on how replication is defined. This heterogeneity could not be completely explained by moderators documented by replication research programs. We also find that these ensembles were not always well-powered to detect potentially meaningful values of heterogeneity. Finally, we identify several discrepancies between the results of original studies and the distribution of effects found by multisite replications but note that these analyses also have low power. We conclude by arguing that efforts to assess replication would benefit from further methodological work on designing replication studies to ensure analyses are sufficiently sensitive.

So far, only one study has focused on the dopamine D1-receptor (D1-R), finding a positive correlation with the trait social desirability, which is characterized by low dominant and high affiliative behavior, while physical aggression showed a negative correlation. The aim of the present study was to replicate these previous findings using a new independent sample of subjects. Materials and methods: Twenty-six healthy males were examined with the radioligand [Â¹Â¹C]SCH-23390, and completed the Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP) which includes measures of social desirability and physical trait aggression. The simplified reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference region was used to calculate BPND values in the whole striatum and limbic striatum. The two regions were selected since they showed strong association between D1-R availability and personality scores in the previous study. Pearson's correlation coefficients and replication Bayes factors were then employed to assess the replicability and robustness of previous results. Results: There were no significant correlations (all p values &gt; 0.3) between regional BPND values and personality scale scores. Replication Bayes factors showed strong to moderate evidence in favor no relationship between D1-receptor availability and social desirability (striatum BF01 = 12.4; limbic striatum BF01 = 7.2) or physical aggression scale scores (limbic striatum BF01 = 3.3), compared to the original correlations. Discussion: We could not replicate the previous findings of associations between D1-R availability and either pro- or antisocial behavior as measured using the SSP. Rather, there was evidence in favor of failed replications of associations between BPND and scale scores. Potential reasons for these results are restrictive variance in both PET and personality outcomes due to high sample homogeneity, or that the previous findings were false positives.

The confidence scores will provide a quantitative assessment of how likely a claim will hold up in an independent replication. To create the scores, we follow earlier approaches and use prediction markets and surveys to forecast replication outcomes. Based on an initial set of forecasts for the overall replication rate in SCORE and its dependence on the academic discipline and the time of publication, we show that participants expect replication rates to increase over time. Moreover, they expect replication rates to differ between fields, with the highest replication rate in economics (average survey response 58%), and the lowest in psychology and in education (average survey response of 42% for both fields). These results reveal insights into the academic community's views of the replication crisis, including for research fields for which no large-scale replication studies have been undertaken yet.; Competing Interests: We declare we have no competing interests.

We have previously reported that short term (4-weeks) administration of a highly bioavailable curcumin preparation (LongvidaÂ©) improved working memory and reduced fatigue and stress reactivity in a healthy older cohort. The present trial (ACTRN12616000484448) was a partial replication study, evaluating similar effects at 4 and 12-weeks LongvidaÂ© supplementation. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups trial was conducted. Eighty participants aged 50-80 years (mean = 68.1, SD = 6.34) were randomised to receive LongvidaÂ© (400 mg daily containing 80 mg curcumin) or a matching placebo. Assessment took place at baseline then following 4 and 12 weeks treatment. Outcome measures included cognitive performance, mood and biomarkers. Compared with placebo, curcumin was associated with several significant effects. These included better working memory performance at 12-weeks (Serial Threes, Serial Sevens and performance on a virtual Morris Water Maze), and lower fatigue scores on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) at both 4 and 12-weeks, and of tension, anger, confusion and total mood disturbance at 4-weeks only. The curcumin group had significantly elevated blood glucose. These results confirm that LongvidaÂ© improves aspects of mood and working memory in a healthy older cohort. The pattern of results is consistent with improvements in hippocampal function and may hold promise for alleviating cognitive decline in some populations.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=32512782&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martial, Charlotte</author><author>Simon, Jessica</author><author>Puttaert, Ninon</author><author>Gosseries, Olivia</author><author>Charland-Verville, Vanessa</author><author>Nyssen, Anne-Sophie</author><author>Greyson, Bruce</author><author>Laureys, Steven</author><author>Cassol, HÃ©lÃ©na</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Near-Death Experience Content (NDE-C) scale: Development and psychometric validation</title><secondary-title>Consciousness and Cognition: An International Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Consciousness and Cognition: An International Journal</full-title><abbr-1>Consciousness and Cognition: An International Journal</abbr-1></periodical><volume>86</volume><keywords><keyword>Concurrent Validity</keyword><keyword>Experiencer</keyword><keyword>Internal Consistency</keyword><keyword>Life-threatening situation</keyword><keyword>Near Death Experiences</keyword><keyword>Near-death experience</keyword><keyword>Phenomenology</keyword><keyword>Rating Scales</keyword><keyword>Scale</keyword><keyword>Test Construction</keyword><keyword>Test Reliability</keyword><keyword>Test Validity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1053-8100</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.concog.2020.103049</electronic-resource-num><abstract>As interest grows in near-death experiences (NDEs), it is increasingly important to accurately identify them to facilitate empirical research and reproducibility among assessors. We aimed (1) to reassess the psychometric properties of the NDE scale developed by Greyson (1983) and (2) to validate the Near-Death Experience Content (NDE-C) scale that quantifies NDEs in a more complete way. Internal consistency, construct and concurrent validity analyses were performed on the NDE scale. Based on those results and the most recent empirical evidence, we then developed a new 20-item scale. Internal consistency, explanatory and confirmatory factor, concurrent and discriminant validity analyses were conducted. Results revealed (1) a series of weaknesses in the NDE scale, (2) a 5-factor structure covering relevant dimensions and the very good psychometric properties of the NDE-C scale, including very good internal consistency (Cronbach Î± = 0.85) and concurrent validity (correlations above 0.76). This new reliable scale should facilitate future research.

Participants were recruited at a university training clinic (13 males, 12 females; M(age) = 26.7 years, SD = 13.3), and they were administered the CPT-II twice in the same day: at the beginning and at the end of the testing session. The overall trends described in the original study were observed in the present sample. However, order effects were generally less pronounced. The pre-post contrast on the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Index score was not statistically significant. The Neurological Index was more impaired at Time 2 (M = 36.3, SD = 19.7) compared with Time 1 (M = 33.3, SD = 19.9): t(17) = 1.63, p = .06, d = 0.38. Likewise, pre-post changes were detected in the number of T-scores &gt;60 from Time 1 (M = 1.6, SD = 2.1) to Time 2 (M = 2.3, SD = 2.8): t(23) = 2.53, p &lt; .05, d = 0.52. Time-related changes in the CPT-II scores appear to be reliable and are likely mediated by the presence of ADHD, perhaps as a precipitator of mental fatigue. Order effects have the potential to function as an emergent diagnostic marker of ADHD.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24826495&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stevens, Jeffrey R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replicability and reproducibility in comparative psychology</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Psychology</full-title><abbr-1>Frontiers in Psychology</abbr-1></periodical><volume>8</volume><keywords><keyword>Animal Models</keyword><keyword>animal research</keyword><keyword>Animal Research</keyword><keyword>comparative psychology</keyword><keyword>Comparative Psychology</keyword><keyword>Experimental Replication</keyword><keyword>pre-registration</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword><keyword>reproducible research</keyword><keyword>Social Psychology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-05-26</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1664-1078</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00862</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Psychology faces a replication crisis. The Reproducibility Project: Psychology sought to replicate the effects of 100 psychology studies. Though 97% of the original studies produced statistically significant results, only 36% of the replication studies did so (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This inability to replicate previously published results, however, is not limited to psychology (Ioannidis, 2005). Replication projects in medicine (Prinz et al., 2011) and behavioral economics (Camerer et al., 2016) resulted in replication rates of 25 and 61%, respectively, and analyses in genetics (MunafÃ², 2009) and neuroscience (Button et al., 2013) question the validity of studies in those fields. Science, in general, is reckoning with challenges in one of its basic tenets: replication. Comparative psychology also faces the grand challenge of producing replicable research. Though social psychology has born the brunt of most of the critique regarding failed replications, comparative psychology suffers from some of the same problems faced by social psychology (e.g., small sample sizes). Yet, comparative psychology follows the methods of cognitive psychology by often using within-subjects designs, which may buffer it from replicability problems (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). In this Grand Challenge article, I explore the shared and unique challenges of and potential solutions for replication and reproducibility in comparative psychology.

A total of 670 participants scoring above MSQ cut-off but not previously diagnosed as having a bipolar disorder were studied, with three principal sample sub-sets derived: 141 who 'took no action', 394 who took action but did not receive a confirmed clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and 135 who took action and had a bipolar diagnosis confirmed by their health professional.; Results: As reported in the initial study, the MSQ was viewed as informative by participants. All three sample sub-sets improved on key study measures--with those receiving a confirmed bipolar diagnosis (and thus most likely to have management plans modified) reporting the greatest improvement.; Limitations: Web-based recruitment risked an unrepresentative sample of individuals with bipolar disorder; sample members may have been biased by high levels of cooperativeness; the MSQ's psychometric properties in community web-based samples remain unestablished.; Conclusions: Results were strikingly consistent with those quantified in the initial study. Findings--including high acceptance and a superior outcome for those who had a bipolar diagnosis clinically confirmed following a 'positive' screen--provide further support for the 'real world' utility of the MSQ screening measure for bipolar disorder.

Reichenbach, 1938). Conceptual replications strive for generalization and can be useful in the context of discovery. Direct replications, by contrast, target the replicability of a specific empirical research result under independent conditions and are thus indispensable in the context of justification. Without assuming replicability, it is impossible to reach a consensus about generally accepted empirical facts. However, such accepted facts are mandatory for testing theories in the empirical sciences. On the basis of this framework, we suggest and motivate standards for replication studies. A characteristic feature of psychological science is the probabilistic nature of the to-be-replicated empirical claim, which typically takes the form of a statistical hypothesis. This raises a number of methodological problems concerning the nature of the replicability hypothesis, the control of error probabilities in statistical decisions about the replicability hypothesis, the determination of the to-bedetected effect size given distortions of published effect sizes by publication bias, the a priori determination of sample sizes for replication studies, and the correct interpretation of the replication rate (i. e., the success rate in a series of replication studies). We propose and discuss solutions for all these problems.

As replicability has consequences for theories derived from empirical studies, it is of utmost importance to better understand the underlying mechanisms influencing it. A popular tool for non-invasive neuroimaging studies is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the effect of underpowered studies is well documented, the empirical assessment of the interplay between sample size and replicability of results for task-based fMRI studies remains limited. In this work, we extend existing work on this assessment in two ways. Firstly, we use a large database of 1400 subjects performing four types of tasks from the IMAGEN project to subsample a series of independent samples of increasing size. Secondly, replicability is evaluated using a multi-dimensional framework consisting of 3 different measures: (un)conditional test-retest reliability, coherence and stability. We demonstrate not only a positive effect of sample size, but also a trade-off between spatial resolution and replicability. When replicability is assessed voxelwise or when observing small areas of activation, a larger sample size than typically used in fMRI is required to replicate results. On the other hand, when focussing on clusters of voxels, we observe a higher replicability. In addition, we observe variability in the size of clusters of activation between experimental paradigms or contrasts of parameter estimates within these.

Successful generalisation is necessary for an intervention to have benefits in everyday life beyond the original learning environment. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of early social communication interventions for children with autism in order to explore generalisation and its measurement. We identified nine RCTs that provided evidence of initial target learning and measured generalisation, of which eight demonstrated at least some successful generalisation across people, settings, and/or activities. The findings did not support the widely reported generalisation âdifficultiesâ associated with autism. However, generalisation was not consistent across all skills within studies, and one study found no generalisation despite evidence for initial target learning within the intervention context. In general, there are few methodologically sound social communication intervention studies exploring generalisation in autism and no consensus on how it should be measured. In particular, failure to demonstrate initial learning of target skills within the intervention setting and an absence of formal mediation analyses of the hypothesised mechanisms limit current research. We outline a framework within which measurement of generalisation can be considered for use in future trials. To maximise the effectiveness of interventions, the field needs to gain a better understanding of the nature of generalisation among autistic individuals and what additional strategies may further enhance learning.

We aimed to identify sleep EEG markers of PTSD that were reproducible across nights and subsamples of our study population. Methods: Seventy-eight combat-exposed veteran men with (n = 31) and without (n = 47) PTSD completed two consecutive nights of high-density EEG recordings in a laboratory. We performed spectral-topographical EEG analyses on data from both nights. To assess reproducibility, we used the first 47 consecutive participants (18 with PTSD) for initial discovery and the remaining 31 participants (13 with PTSD) for replication. Results: In the discovery analysis, compared with non-PTSD participants, PTSD participants exhibited (1) reduced delta power (1â4 Hz) in the centro-parietal regions during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and (2) elevated high-frequency power, most prominent in the gamma band (30â40 Hz), in the antero-frontal regions during both NREM and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These findings were consistent across the two study nights, with reproducible trends in the replication analysis. We found no significant group differences in theta power (4â8 Hz) during REM sleep and sigma power (12â15 Hz) during N2 sleep. Conclusions: The reduced centro-parietal NREM delta power, indicating reduced sleep depth, and the elevated antero-frontal NREM and REM gamma powers, indicating heightened central arousal, are potential objective sleep markers of PTSD. If independently validated, these putative EEG markers may offer new targets for the development of sleep-specific PTSD diagnostics and interventions.

Methods: A total of 78 combat-exposed veteran men with (n = 31) and without (n = 47) PTSD completed two consecutive laboratory nights of high-density EEG recordings. We computed a measure of synchrony for each EEG channel-pair across three sleep stages (rapid eye movement [REM] and non-REM stages 2 and 3) and six frequency bands. We examined the median synchrony in 9 region-of-interest (ROI) pairs consisting of 6 bilateral brain regions (left and right frontal, central, and parietal regions) for 10 frequency-band and sleep-stage combinations. To assess reproducibility, we used the first 47 consecutive subjects (18 with PTSD) for initial discovery and the remaining 31 subjects (13 with PTSD) for replication. Results: In the discovery analysis, five alpha-band synchrony pairs during non-REM sleep were consistently larger in PTSD subjects compared with controls (effect sizes ranging from 0.52 to 1.44) across consecutive nights: two between the left-frontal and left-parietal ROIs, one between the left-central and left-parietal ROIs, and two across central and parietal bilateral ROIs. These trends were preserved in the replication set. Conclusion: PTSD subjects showed increased alpha-band synchrony during non-REM sleep in the left frontoparietal, left centro-parietal, and inter-parietal brain regions. Importantly, these trends were reproducible across consecutive nights and subpopulations. Thus, these alterations in alpha synchrony may be discriminatory of PTSD.

Kupor, Laurin, and Levav (2015) reported nine studies that all yielded statistically significant results consistent with the hypothesis that they do. We conducted two large-sample Preregistered Direct Replications (N = 1,104) of studies in Kupor et al.âs article (Studies 1a and 1b) and evaluated replicability via (a) statistical significance, (b) a 'small-telescopes' approach, (c) Bayes factors (BFs), and (d) meta-analyses pooled across original and replication studies. None of these approaches replicated the original studiesâ effects. Combining both original studies and both replications yielded strong evidence in support of the null over a default alternative hypothesis, BF01 = 11.04, meaning that the totality of evidence speaks against the possibility that religious primes increased nonmoral risk taking in these designs. This suggests that support for the 'anticipating-divine-protection' hypothesis may be overstated.

The average power of a set of prior studies is a quantity that has attracted considerable attention for this purpose, and techniques to estimate this quantity via a meta-analytic approach have recently been proposed. In this article, we have two aims. First, we clarify the nature of average power and its implications for replicability. We explain that average power is not relevant to the replicability of actual prospective replication studies. Instead, it relates to efforts in the history of science to catalogue the power of prior studies. Second, we evaluate the statistical properties of point estimates and interval estimates of average power obtained via the meta-analytic approach. We find that point estimates of average power are too variable and inaccurate for use in application. We also find that the width of interval estimates of average power depends on the corresponding point estimates; consequently, the width of an interval estimate of average power cannot serve as an independent measure of the precision of the point estimate. Our findings resolve a seeming puzzle posed by three estimates of the average power of the power-posing literature obtained via the meta-analytic approach.

In an increasingly widespread replication study design, each of several collaborating sites (such as universities) independently tries to replicate an original study, and the results are synthesized across sites. Hedges and Schauer (2019) proposed statistical analyses for these replication projects; their analyses focus on assessing the extent to which results differ across the replication sites, by testing for heterogeneity among a set of replication studies, while excluding the original study. We agree with their premises regarding the limitations of existing analysis methods and regarding the importance of accounting for heterogeneity among the replications. This objective may be interesting in its own right. However, we argue that by focusing only on whether the replication studies have similar effect sizes to one another, these analyses are not particularly appropriate for assessing whether the replications in fact support the scientific effect under investigation or for assessing the power of multisite replication projects. We reanalyze Hedges and Schauerâs (2019) example dataset using alternative metrics of replication success that directly address these objectives. We reach a more optimistic conclusion regarding replication success than they did, illustrating that the alternative metrics can lead to quite different conclusions from those of Hedges and Schauer (2019).

One factor influencing reproducibility is the simultaneous testing of multiple hypotheses, which entails false positive findings unless the analyzed p-values are carefully corrected. While this multiple testing problem is well known and studied, it continues to be both a theoretical and practical problem.; New Method: Here we assess reproducibility in simulated experiments in the context of multiple testing. We consider methods that control either the family-wise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR), including techniques based on random field theory (RFT), cluster-mass based permutation testing, and adaptive FDR. Several classical methods are also considered. The performance of these methods is investigated under two different models.; Results: We found that permutation testing is the most powerful method among the considered approaches to multiple testing, and that grouping hypotheses based on prior knowledge can improve power. We also found that emphasizing primary and follow-up studies equally produced most reproducible outcomes.; Comparison With Existing Method(s): We have extended the use of two-group and separate-classes models for analyzing reproducibility and provide a new open-source software "MultiPy" for multiple hypothesis testing.; Conclusions: Our simulations suggest that performing strict corrections for multiple testing is not sufficient to improve reproducibility of neuroimaging experiments. The methods are freely available as a Python toolkit "MultiPy" and we aim this study to help in improving statistical data analysis practices and to assist in conducting power and reproducibility analyses for new experiments.; Competing Interests: Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no competing financial or other interests.

Recently, the procedure of connectome fingerprinting, using brain functional connectivity profiles as such signatures, was shown to be able to accurately identify individuals from a group of 126 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). However, the specificity and generalizability of this procedure were not tested. In this replication study, we show both for the original and an extended HCP data set (n = 900 subjects), as well as for an additional data set of more commonly acquired imaging quality (n = 84) that (i) although the high accuracy can be replicated for the larger HCP 900 data set, accuracy is (ii) lower for standard neuroimaging data, and, that (iii) connectome fingerprinting may not be specific enough to distinguish between individuals. In addition, both accuracy and specificity are projected to drop considerably as the size of a data set increases. Although the moderate-to-high accuracies do suggest there is a portion of unique variance, our results suggest that connectomes may actually be quite similar across individuals. This outcome may be relevant to how precision psychiatry could benefit from inferences based on functional connectomes.

Transparent reporting of analytical characteristics allows readers to assess the validity and generalizability of clinical studies in which biomarkers are used. Our aims were to assess the reporting of analytical characteristics of biomarkers used in clinical research and to evaluate the extent of reported characterization procedures for assay precision.; Methods: We searched 5 medical journals ( Annals of Internal Medicine , JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association , The Lancet , The New England Journal of Medicine , and PLOS Medicine ) over a 10-year period for the term "biomarker" in the full-text field. We included studies in which biomarkers were used for inclusion/exclusion of study participants, for patient classification, or as a study outcome. We tabulated the frequencies of reporting of 11 key analytical characteristics (such as analytical accuracy of test results) in the included studies.; Results: A total of 544 studies and 1299 biomarker uses met the inclusion criteria. No information on analytical characteristics was reported for 67% of the biomarkers. For 65 biomarkers (3%), â¥4 characteristics were reported (range, 4-8). The manufacturer of the measurement procedure could not be determined for 688 (53%) of the 1299 biomarkers. The extent of assessments of assay imprecision, when reported, did not meet expectations for clinical use of biomarkers.; Conclusions: Reporting of the analytical performance of biomarker measurements is variable and often absent from published clinical studies. We suggest that readers need fuller reporting of analytical characteristics to interpret study results, assess generalizability of conclusions, and compare results among clinical studies.

The rate of replication, however, has yet to be assessed for ecology and evolution. Here, I survey the open-access ecology and evolution literature to determine how often ecologists and evolutionary biologists replicate, or at least claim to replicate, previously published studies. I found that approximately 0.023% of ecology and evolution studies are described by their authors as replications. Two of the 11 original-replication study pairs provided sufficient statistical detail for three effects so as to permit a formal analysis of replication success. Replicating authors correctly concluded that they replicated an original effect in two cases; in the third case, my analysis suggests that the finding by the replicating authors was consistent with the original finding, contrary the conclusion of "replication failure" by the authors.; Competing Interests: Clint D.

A wide variety of instruments are developed to screen for affective symptoms and OD. The current paper aims to systematically review and appraise the literature to obtain insight into the prevalence, strength, and causal direction of the relationship between affective symptoms and OD in HNC patients. This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. A systematic search of the literature was performed using PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and Embase. All available publications reporting on the relationship between affective conditions and swallowing function in HNC patients were included. Conference papers, tutorials, reviews, and studies with less than 5 patients were excluded. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The level of evidence and methodological quality were assessed using the ABC-rating scale and QualSyst critical appraisal tool. Eleven studies reported a positive relationship between affective symptoms and OD. The findings of this paper highlight the importance of affective symptom screening in dysphagic HNC patients as clinically relevant affective symptoms and OD seems to be prevalent and coincident in this population. Considering the impact of affective symptoms and OD on patients' daily life, early detection and an integrated interdisciplinary approach are recommended. However, due to the heterogeneity of study designs, outcomes, and outcome measures, the generalization of study results is limited. (Â© 2022.

Inference from Nordic population-based twin data indicates rare high-risk loci as the chief determinant of breast cancer risk. Here, we use haplotypes, rather than single variants, to identify rare high-risk loci for breast cancer. With computationally phased genotypes from 181,034 white British women in the UK Biobank, a genome-wide haplotype-breast cancer association analysis was conducted using sliding windows of 5 to 500 consecutive array-genotyped variants. In the discovery stage, haplotype-breast cancer associations were evaluated retrospectively in the prestudy-enrollment data including 5,487 breast cancer cases. Breast cancer hazard ratios (HR) for additive haplotypic effects were estimated using Cox regression. The replication analysis included a prospective cohort of women free of breast cancer at enrollment, of whom 3,524 later developed breast cancer. This two-stage analysis detected 13 rare loci (frequency &lt;1%), each associated with an appreciable breast cancer-risk increase (discovery: HRs = 2.84-6.10, P &lt; 5 Ã 10-8; replication: HRs = 2.08-5.61, P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, the variants that formed these rare haplotypes individually exhibited much smaller effects. Functional annotation revealed extensive cis-regulatory DNA elements in breast cancer-related cells underlying the replicated rare haplotypes. Using phased, imputed genotypes from 30,064 cases and 25,282 controls in the DRIVE OncoArray case-control study, 6 of the 13 rare-loci associations were found generalizable (odds ratio estimates: 1.48-7.67, P &lt; 0.05). This study demonstrates the complementary advantage of utilizing rare haplotypes to capture novel risk loci and suggests the potential for the discovery of more genetic elements contributing to cancer heritability as large data sets of germline whole-genome sequencing become available.; Significance: A genome-wide two-stage haplotype analysis identifies rare haplotypes associated with breast cancer risk and suggests that the rare risk haplotypes represent long-range interactions with regulatory consequences influencing cancer risk.

This research assessed the reproducibility of the Brief Religious Coping (RCOPE) instrument in an African setting using athletes' samples from different countries. Particularly, the research sought to assess the (1) factor structure of Brief RCOPE with an African sample, (2) construct validity of the RCOPE measure, and (3) measurement invariance of the RCOPE instrument based on gender and nationality.; Methods: The study surveyed a convenient sample of 300 athletes, including 164 male and 136 female athletes, from 3 African countries (Benin, Ghana, and Nigeria) who participated in the 2018 West African University Games. The Brief RCOPE instrument was administered to the athletes for validation purposes before the competition. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted using the ordinal factor analytic approach.; Results: This validation study confirmed the two-factor dimension (positive and negative religious coping) of the Brief RCOPE measure. Further, all items for each of the dimensions of the inventory contributed significantly to the measure of the Brief RCOPE domains. The positive and negative religious coping dimensions contributed more than half of the variance of their respective indicators. Measurement invariance across gender and nationality was confirmed.; Conclusion: Sufficient evidence was gathered to support the interpretation and use of the Brief RCOPE measure. Coaches and sports psychologists could adopt the Brief RCOPE measure to understand the mental or thought patterns of religious athletes based on existential concerns or stress accrued from impending competitions to inform appropriate religious coping interventions. This notwithstanding, the Minimum Clinical Important Difference (MCID) of the Brief RCOPE should be further investigated to enhance the utility of the instrument for use in intervention-based studies.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

For the first time, we systematically assessed how HLA incompatibility was defined in contemporary peer-reviewed publications and its prognostic implication to transplant outcomes.; Methods: We combined 2 independent searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from 2015 to 2019. Content-expert reviewers screened for original research on outcomes of HLA-incompatible transplants (defined as allele or molecular mismatch and solid-phase or cell-based assays). We ascertained the completeness of reporting on a predefined set of variables assessing HLA incompatibility, therapies, and outcomes. Given significant heterogeneity, we conducted narrative synthesis and assessed risk of bias in studies examining the association between death-censored graft failure and HLA incompatibility.; Results: Of 6656 screened articles, 163 evaluated transplant outcomes by HLA incompatibility. Most articles reported on cytotoxic/flow T-cell crossmatches (n = 98). Molecular genotypes were reported for selected loci at the allele-group level. Sixteen articles reported on epitope compatibility. Pretransplant donor-specific HLA antibodies were often considered (n = 143); yet there was heterogeneity in sample handling, assay procedure, and incomplete reporting on donor-specific HLA antibodies assignment. Induction (n = 129) and maintenance immunosuppression (n = 140) were frequently mentioned but less so rejection treatment (n = 72) and desensitization (n = 70). Studies assessing death-censored graft failure risk by HLA incompatibility were vulnerable to bias in the participant, predictor, and analysis domains.; Conclusions: Optimization of transplant outcomes and personalized care depends on accurate HLA compatibility assessment. Reporting on a standard set of variables will help assess generalizability of research, allow knowledge synthesis, and facilitate international collaboration in clinical trials.; Competing Interests: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

In animals, the cost of maintaining an effective immune response may reduce the ability to invest in reproduction, resulting in altered susceptibility to disease. However, not all members of a population face identical constraints because differences in an individual's environmental context or physiological state can influence the degree to which traits are negatively associated. Here, we evaluated how variation in timing of breeding, a correlate of fitness, may result in different patterns of trait associations between immunity and reproduction. We measured constitutive immunity in breeding female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) using a bacteria killing assay with blood plasma to assess the relationships between bacteria killing ability (BKA), reproductive effort, and reproductive success. We found that timing of breeding can influence the association between BKA and reproductive effort, but its effects are not homogeneous among all traits. Late-breeding tree swallows with stronger BKA laid smaller clutches, a pattern that was not apparent in early breeders. Regardless of the timing of breeding, birds with stronger BKA fed their nestlings less. Despite a negative association with reproductive effort, we found no association between immunity and reproductive success. We provide evidence that individual tree swallows do not experience some trade-offs equally, and that timing of breeding likely plays a role in how costs of immunity are weighed. To understand how investment in immunity can limit life history traits, we must consider how a variation among individuals influences the relative costs of immunity. (Â© The Author(s) 2022.

Recent computing technologies, such as virtualization, have made it possible to reproduce workflow execution with ease. However, the reproducibility of results is not well discussed; that is, there is no standard way to verify whether the biological interpretation of reproduced results is the same. Therefore, it still remains a challenge to automatically evaluate the reproducibility of results.; Results: We propose a new metric, a reproducibility scale of workflow execution results, to evaluate the reproducibility of results. This metric is based on the idea of evaluating the reproducibility of results using biological feature values (e.g., number of reads, mapping rate, and variant frequency) representing their biological interpretation. We also implemented a prototype system that automatically evaluates the reproducibility of results using the proposed metric. To demonstrate our approach, we conducted an experiment using workflows used by researchers in real research projects and the use cases that are frequently encountered in the field of bioinformatics.; Conclusions: Our approach enables automatic evaluation of the reproducibility of results using a fine-grained scale. By introducing our approach, it is possible to evolve from a binary view of whether the results are superficially identical or not to a more graduated view. We believe that our approach will contribute to more informed discussion on reproducibility in bioinformatics. (Â© The Author(s) 2023.

However, genetic factors that determine the contribution of beneficial mutations during adaptive evolution are poorly understood. In this study, we experimentally evolved wild-type Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and its isogenic derivative that has two additional replication origins and shows higher background fitness. During the short time of experimental evolution, the fitness gains of the two E. coli strains with different fitness backgrounds converged. Populational genome sequencing revealed various mutations with different allele frequencies in evolved populations. Several mutations occurred in genes affecting transcriptional regulation (e.g., RNA polymerase subunit, RNase, ppGpp synthetase, and transcription termination/antitermination factor genes). When we introduced mutations into the ancestral E. coli strains, beneficial effects tended to be lower in the ancestor with higher initial fitness. Replication rate analysis showed that the various replication indices do not correlate with the growth rate. Transcriptome profiling showed that gene expression and gene ontology are markedly enriched in populations with lower background fitness after experimental evolution. Further, the degree of transcriptional change was proportional to the fitness gain. Thus, the evolutionary trajectories of bacteria with different fitness backgrounds can be complex and counterintuitive. Notably, transcriptional change is a major contributor to adaptability. IMPORTANCE Predicting the adaptive potential of bacterial populations can be difficult due to their complexity and dynamic environmental conditions. Also, epistatic interaction between mutations affects the adaptive trajectory. Nevertheless, next-generation sequencing sheds light on understanding evolutionary dynamics through high-throughput genome and transcriptome information. Experimental evolution of two E. coli strains with different background fitness showed that the trajectories of fitness gain, which slowed down during the later stages of evolution, became convergent. This suggests that the adaptability of bacteria can be counterintuitive and that predicting the evolutionary path of bacteria can be difficult even in a constant environment. In addition, transcriptional change is associated with fitness gain during the evolutionary process. Thus, the adaptability of cells depends on their intrinsic genetic capacity for a given evolutionary period. This should be considered when genetically engineered bacteria are optimized through adaptive evolution.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=36445144&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tee, Mian Zi</author><author>Er, Yi Xian</author><author>Easton, Alice V</author><author>Yap, Nan Jiun</author><author>Lee, Ii Li</author><author>Devlin, Joseph</author><author>Chen, Ze</author><author>Ng, Kee Seong</author><author>Subramanian, Poorani</author><author>Angelova, Angelina</author><author>Oyesola, Oyebola</author><author>Sargsian, Shushan</author><author>Ngui, Romano</author><author>Beiting, Daniel P</author><author>Boey, Christopher Chiong Meng</author><author>Chua, Kek Heng</author><author>Cadwell, Ken</author><author>Lim, Yvonne Ai Lian</author><author>Loke, P'ng</author><author>Lee, Soo Ching</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gut microbiome of helminth-infected indigenous Malaysians is context dependent.</title><secondary-title>Microbiome</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microbiome</full-title><abbr-1>Microbiome</abbr-1></periodical><pages>214</pages><volume>10</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Albendazole</keyword><keyword>Helminth</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Indigenous population</keyword><keyword>Metagenomic sequencing</keyword><keyword>Metagenomics*</keyword><keyword>Microbiome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-12-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2049-2618</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40168-022-01385-x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: While microbiomes in industrialized societies are well characterized, indigenous populations with traditional lifestyles have microbiomes that are more akin to those of ancient humans. However, metagenomic data in these populations remains scarce, and the association with soil-transmitted helminth infection status is unclear. Here, we sequenced 650 metagenomes of indigenous Malaysians from five villages with different prevalence of helminth infections.; Results: Individuals from villages with higher prevalences of helminth infections have more unmapped reads and greater microbial diversity. Microbial community diversity and composition were most strongly associated with different villages and the effects of helminth infection status on the microbiome varies by village. Longitudinal changes in the microbiome in response to albendazole anthelmintic treatment were observed in both helminth infected and uninfected individuals. Inference of bacterial population replication rates from origin of replication analysis identified specific replicating taxa associated with helminth infection.; Conclusions: Our results indicate that helminth effects on the microbiota were highly dependent on context, and effects of albendazole on the microbiota can be confounding for the interpretation of deworming studies. Furthermore, a substantial quantity of the microbiome remains unannotated, and this large dataset from an indigenous population associated with helminth infections is a valuable resource for future studies.

Biweekly CFRs of COVID-19 were estimated bypooled generalized linear squares regression models for the panel data. Covariates includedthe predominant virus variant, reproduction rate, vaccination, national economic status,hospital beds, diabetes prevalence, and population share of individuals older than age 65. Intotal, 21 countries were eligible for analysis.; Results: Adjustment for covariates reduced variation in the CFRs of COVID-19 across countriesand over time. Regression results showed that the dominant spread of the Omicron variant,reproduction rate, and vaccination were associated with lower country-level CFRs, whereasage, the extreme poverty rate, and diabetes prevalence were associated with higher countrylevel CFRs.; Conclusion: A direct comparison of crude CFRs among countries may be fallacious, especiallyin a cross-sectional analysis. Our study presents an adjusted comparison of CFRs over timefor a more proper comparison. In addition, our findings suggest that comparing CFRs amongdifferent countries without considering their context, such as the epidemic phase, medicalcapacity, surveillance strategy, and socio-demographic traits, should be avoided.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=36617548&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bell, Suzanne O</author><author>Guiella, Georges</author><author>Anjur-Dietrich, Selena</author><author>Bazie, Fiacre</author><author>Onadja, Yentema</author><author>Ahmed, Saifuddin</author><author>Moreau, Caroline</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social Network-Based Induced Abortion Incidence Estimation in Burkina Faso: Examining the Impact of the Network Generating Question.</title><secondary-title>Studies in family planning</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studies in family planning</full-title><abbr-1>Studies in family planning</abbr-1></periodical><pages>639-655</pages><volume>53</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Abortion, Induced*</keyword><keyword>Abortion, Spontaneous*</keyword><keyword>Burkina Faso/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Social Networking</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1728-4465</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/sifp.12213</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Social network-based methods are increasingly used to estimate induced abortion incidence and investigate correlates. Approaches differ in the social tie definitions used to identify which social network members' abortion experiences respondents will report. This study compares the effect of using the "best friend" (closest female friend) versus "confidante" (specifying mutual sharing of personal information) definition on abortion incidence estimation. We use data from a nationally representative survey of women aged 15-49 in Burkina Faso (conducted in 2020-2021) where respondents were randomized into two versions of an abortion module, using different friend definitions. We computed abortion rate estimates by friend definition and adjusted for assumption violations (transmission bias, surrogate sample selection bias). Unadjusted incidence rates varied from 11.7 [4.1-19.2] abortions per 1,000 women to 15.6 [9.7-21.4], depending on friend definition. The confidante definition yielded higher adjusted estimates (36.2 [25.1-47.2]) than the best friend definition (17.0 [8.7-25.3]) due to greater transmission bias adjustment. Both estimates exceeded the respondent self-reported abortion incidence (4.0 [2.2-5.9]). Our results indicate that either friend definition produces higher incidence estimates than self-report but suggest a potential advantage for the "best friend" over the "confidante" definition given lower transmission bias. Further research should assess generalizability of these findings in other contexts. (Â© 2022 The Authors.

Regardless of its importance, limited research is available on detection dog odor generalization. The objectives of this study were (1) evaluate the use of an intermittent schedule of reinforcement to assess generalization in dogs and (2) evaluate olfactory generalization from a single exemplar of smokeless powder (SP). Dogs (Nâ=â5) were trained to detect SP in an automated olfactometer under an intermittent schedule of reinforcement where only 60% of correct responses were reinforced. After training, eight non-reinforced probe trials were inserted within a session. A total of 15 testing odors were evaluated across 15 consecutive sessions (one odor/session). Six of the testing odors were control and the remaining testing odors were objects indirectly exposed to SP, objects that contained or were directly exposed to SP, single-base SP and diphenylamine (the main volatile present in the headspace of SP). Dogs' response rate to all testing odors except for the cotton gauzes and t-shirt cloths exposed to the headspace of SP, the simulated IED, and Getxent tubes exposed to direct contact with SP were statistically lower than their response rate of actual SP. The response rate to SP was not different across all 15 testing sessions suggesting that the intermittent schedule of reinforcement, maintained dog motivation and performance. Data show that the outlined method is a good approach to study generalization in detection dogs. These results also highlight dog generalization to SP varieties and associated odors. (Â© 2022.

The Moral Foundations Hypothesis states that liberals rely more on foundations of care/harm and fairness/cheating whereas conservatives rely more on loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and purity/degradation in their moral functioning. In support, Graham, Haidt, and Nosek (2009; Study 4) showed that sermons delivered by liberal and conservative pastors differed as predicted in their moral word usage, except for the loyalty foundation. I present two high-powered replication studies in religious contexts and six extension studies in politics, the media, and organizations to test ideological differences in moral language usage. On average, replication success rate was 30% and effect sizes were 38 times smaller than those in the original study. A meta-analysis (N = 303,680) found that compared to liberals, conservatives used more authority r = 0.05, 95% confidence interval = [0.02, 0.09] and purity words, r = 0.14 [0.09, 0.19], fewer loyalty words, r = â0.08 [â0.10, â0.05], and no more or less harm, r = 0.00 [â0.02, 0.02], or fairness words, r = â0.03 [â0.06, 0.01].

Guidelines were developed to standardize the reporting of interventions, but failed to provide guidance on reporting of the theory of interventions. Further, space constraints imposed by many research journals often limit the comprehensive description of both the theoretical and operational aspects of interventions. Purpose: To address these gaps, we propose that the theory of interventions be published in separate conceptual papers that would provide an in-depth description of the health problem targeted by an intervention, the components comprising an intervention, the causal mechanism responsible for an interventionâs impact on the outcomes, and the conditions necessary for the proper implementation and the effectiveness of an intervention. Implications: Such papers would assist in the critical appraisal of the adequacy, implementation, and evaluation of interventions. A description of the theory of interventions clarifies to health professionals what the interventions are about, who is likely to benefit from the interventions, how the interventions work and under what context.

In the present experimental study, we investigated whether this holds true for postâtraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to childhood abuse. We expected that fear generalization under experimental conditions reflects generalization of aversive stimuli to different social domains in real life. Sixtyâfour women with PTSD after childhood abuse and 30 healthy participants (HC) underwent a differential fear conditioning and generalization paradigm. Online risk ratings, reaction time, and fearâpotentiated startle served as dependent variables. Based on the subjectively assessed generalization of triggered intrusions across different domains of life, PTSD participants were split into two groups reporting low (lowâGEN) and high (highâGEN) generalization. PTSD patients reported a higher expectation of an aversive event. During fear conditioning, they assessed the risk of danger related to a safety cue slower and showed a blunted fearâpotentiated startle toward the danger cue. During generalization testing, reaction time increased in the highâGEN patients and decreased in the HC group with increasing similarity of a stimulus with the conditioned safety cue. Alterations of fear learning in PTSD suggest impaired defensive responses in case of a high threat probability. Moreover, our findings bridge the gap between the generalization of aversive cues during everyday life and laboratoryâbased experimental parameters: impairments in the processing of cues signaling safety generalize particularly in those patients who report a spreading of PTSD symptoms across different domains of everyday life.

This article proposes a weakly supervised discriminative learning with a spectral constrained generative adversarial network (GAN) for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), called weaklyAD. It can enhance the discrimination between anomaly and background with background homogenization and anomaly saliency in cases where anomalous samples are limited and sensitive to the background. A novel probability-based category thresholding is first proposed to label coarse samples in preparation for weakly supervised learning. Subsequently, a discriminative reconstruction model is learned by the proposed network in a weakly supervised fashion. The proposed network has an end-to-end architecture, which not only includes an encoder, a decoder, a latent layer discriminator, and a spectral discriminator competitively but also contains a novel Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based orthogonal projection divergence (OPD) spectral constraint. Finally, the well-learned network is used to reconstruct HSIs captured by the same sensor. Our work paves a new weakly supervised way for HAD, which intends to match the performance of supervised methods without the prerequisite of manually labeled data. Assessments and generalization experiments over real HSIs demonstrate the unique promise of such a proposed approach.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=34057896&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bartolomeo, Cynthia Silva</author><author>Lemes, Robertha Mariana Rodrigues</author><author>Morais, Rafael Leite</author><author>Pereria, Gabriela Cruz</author><author>Nunes, Tamires Alves</author><author>Costa, Angelica Jardim</author><author>de Barros Maciel, Rui Monteiro</author><author>Braconi, Carla Torres</author><author>Maricato, Juliana Terzi</author><author>Janini, Luiz Mario Ramos</author><author>Okuda, Liria Hiromi</author><author>Lee, Kil Sun</author><author>Prado, Carla MÃ¡ximo</author><author>Ureshino, Rodrigo Portes</author><author>Stilhano, Roberta Sessa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication kinetics in different human cell types: The role of autophagy, cellular metabolism and ACE2 expression.</title><secondary-title>Life sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Life sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Life sciences</abbr-1></periodical><pages>120930</pages><volume>308</volume><keywords><keyword>ACE2</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Triphosphate</keyword><keyword>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2/genetics</keyword><keyword>Autophagy</keyword><keyword>Caco-2 Cells</keyword><keyword>Cell lines</keyword><keyword>Citrate (si)-Synthase</keyword><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>COVID-19*</keyword><keyword>HEK293 Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mitochondria</keyword><keyword>Neuroblastoma*</keyword><keyword>Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger/genetics</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2</keyword><keyword>TMPRSS2</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-11-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1879-0631</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120930</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aims: This study evaluated SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cell lines derived from various tissues and investigated molecular mechanisms related to viral infection susceptibility and replication.; Main Methods: SARS-CoV-2 replication in BEAS-2B and A549 (respiratory tract), HEK-293Â T (kidney), HuH7 (liver), SH-SY5Y (brain), MCF7 (breast), Huvec (endothelial) and Caco-2 (intestine) was evaluated by RT-qPCR. Concomitantly, expression levels of ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) and TMPRSS2 were assessed through RT-qPCR and western blot. Proteins related to autophagy and mitochondrial metabolism were monitored in uninfected cells to characterize the cellular metabolism of each cell line. The effect of ACE2 overexpression on viral replication in pulmonary cells was also investigated.; Key Findings: Our data show that HuH7, Caco-2 and MCF7 presented a higher viral load compared to the other cell lines. The increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be associated not only with the differential levels of proteins intrinsically related to energetic metabolism, such as ATP synthase, citrate synthase, COX and NDUFS2 but also with the considerably higher TMPRSS2 mRNA expression. The two least susceptible cell types, BEAS-2B and A549, showed drastically increased SARS-CoV-2 replication capacity when ACE2 was overexpressed. These modified cell lines are relevant for studying SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro.; Significance: Our data not only reinforce that TMPRSS2 expression and cellular energy metabolism are important molecular mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, but also indicate that HuH7, MCF7 and Caco-2 are suitable models for mechanistic studies of COVID-19. Moreover, pulmonary cells overexpressing ACE2 can be used to understand mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 replication.; Competing Interests: Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

In this study, we focus on cancer omics data, for which the examination of replicability has been mostly focused on important omics variables identified in different studies. In published literature, although there have been extensive attention and ad hoc discussions, there is insufficient quantitative research looking into replicability measures and their properties. The goal of this study is to fill this important knowledge gap. In particular, we consider three sensible replicability measures, for which we examine distributional properties and develop a way of making inference. Applying them to three The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets reveals in general low replicability and significant across-data variations. To further comprehend such findings, we resort to simulation, which confirms the validity of the findings with the TCGA data and further informs the dependence of replicability on signal level (or equivalently sample size). Overall, this study can advance our understanding of replicability for cancer omics and other studies that have identification as a key goal. (Â© The Author(s) 2022.

However, there is little population representative data about who social media users are which limits understanding of confounding factors between mental health and social media. Here we profile users of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children population cohort (N=4,083). We provide estimates of demographics and mental health and well-being outcomes by platform. We find that users of different platforms and frequencies are not homogeneous. User groups differ primarily by sex and YouTube users are the most likely to have poorer mental health outcomes. Instagram and Snapchat users tend to have higher well-being than the other social media sites considered. Relationships between use-frequency and well-being differ depending on the specific well-being construct measured. The reproducibility of future research may be improved by stratifying by sex and being specific about the well-being constructs used.; Competing Interests: Competing Interests The authors declare no competing interests.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=37994321&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jorge, D C P</author><author>Oliveira, J F</author><author>Miranda, J G V</author><author>Andrade, R F S</author><author>Pinho, S T R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the effective reproduction number for heterogeneous models using incidence data.</title><secondary-title>Royal Society open science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Royal Society open science</full-title><abbr-1>Royal Society open science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>220005</pages><volume>9</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>effective reproduction number</keyword><keyword>mathematical models</keyword><keyword>meta-population models</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-09-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2054-5703</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rsos.220005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The effective reproduction number,                            R                        (            t            )          , plays a key role in the study of infectious diseases, indicating the current average number of new infections caused by an infected individual in an epidemic process.

However, for systems that present heterogeneity, either on the host population or in the expression of the disease, there is a lack of data and of a suitable general methodology to obtain g ( Ï ). In this work, we use mathematical models to bridge this gap. We present a general methodology for obtaining explicit expressions of the reproduction numbers and the generation interval distributions, within and between model sub-compartments provided by an arbitrary compartmental model. Additionally, we present the appropriate expressions to evaluate those reproduction numbers using incidence data. To highlight the relevance of such methodology, we apply it to the spread of COVID-19 in municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Using two meta-population models, we estimate the reproduction numbers and the contributions of each municipality in the generation of cases in all others.

Many CAD systems operate by analyzing the region-of-interest (ROI) that contains the tumor in the BUS image using conventional texture-based classification models and deep learning-based classification models. Hence, the development of these systems requires automatic methods to localize the ROI that contains the tumor in the BUS image. Deep learning object-detection models can be used to localize the ROI that contains the tumor, but the ROI generated by one model might be better than the ROIs generated by other models. In this study, a new method, called the edge-based selection method, is proposed to analyze the ROIs generated by different deep learning object-detection models with the goal of selecting the ROI that improves the localization of the tumor region. The proposed method employs edge maps computed for BUS images using the recently introduced Dense Extreme Inception Network (DexiNed) deep learning edge-detection model. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study that has employed a deep learning edge-detection model to detect the tumor edges in BUS images. The proposed edge-based selection method is applied to analyze the ROIs generated by four deep learning object-detection models. The performance of the proposed edge-based selection method and the four deep learning object-detection models is evaluated using two BUS image datasets. The first dataset, which is used to perform cross-validation evaluation analysis, is a private dataset that includes 380 BUS images. The second dataset, which is used to perform generalization evaluation analysis, is a public dataset that includes 630 BUS images. For both the cross-validation evaluation analysis and the generalization evaluation analysis, the proposed method obtained the overall ROI detection rate, mean precision, mean recall, and mean F1-score values of 98%, 0.91, 0.90, and 0.90, respectively. Moreover, the results show that the proposed edge-based selection method outperformed the four deep learning object-detection models as well as three baseline-combining methods that can be used to combine the ROIs generated by the four deep learning object-detection models. These findings suggest the potential of employing our proposed method to analyze the ROIs generated using different deep learning object-detection models to select the ROI that improves the localization of the tumor region.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=36146070&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hatle, John D</author><author>Maslikova, Victoriya</author><author>Short, Clancy A</author><author>Bracey, Donald</author><author>Darmanjian, Margaret</author><author>Morningstar, Sarah</author><author>Reams, Brooke</author><author>Mashanov, Vladimir S</author><author>Jahan-Mihan, Alireza</author><author>Hahn, Daniel A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein storage and reproduction increase in grasshoppers on a diet matched to the amino acids of egg yolk protein.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of experimental biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of experimental biology</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of experimental biology</abbr-1></periodical><volume>225</volume><number>17</number><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acids/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animal Feed</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diet</keyword><keyword>Egg Proteins/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Egg Yolk*/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Exome-matched diet</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Grasshoppers*/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hexamerins</keyword><keyword>Reproduction</keyword><keyword>Vitellogenin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1477-9145</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jeb.244450</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The diets of animals are essential to support development, and protein is key. Accumulation of stored nutrients can support developmental events such as molting and initiation of reproduction. Agricultural studies have addressed how dietary protein quality affects growth, but few studies have addressed the effects of dietary protein quality on developmental transitions. Studies on how dietary quality may affect protein storage and development are possible in arthropods, which store proteins in the hemolymph. We hypothesized that diets with a composition of amino acids that matches the precursor of egg yolk protein (vitellogenin, Vg) will be high quality and support both egg production and accumulation of storage proteins. Grasshoppers were fed one of two isonitrogenous solutions of amino acids daily: Vg-balanced (matched to Vg) or Unbalanced (same total moles of amino acids, but not matched to egg yolk). We measured reproduction and storage protein levels in serial hemolymph samples from individuals. The Vg-balanced group had greater reproduction and greater cumulative levels of storage proteins than did the Unbalanced group. This occurred even though amino acids fed to the Vg-balanced group were not a better match to storage protein than were the amino acids fed to the Unbalanced group. Further, oviposition timing was best explained by a combination of diet, age at the maximum level of storage protein hexamerin-270 and accumulation of hexamerin-90. Our study tightens the link between storage proteins and commitment to reproduction, and shows that dietary protein quality is vital for protein storage and reproduction.; Competing Interests: Competing interests The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

Several studies indicated that changes in indoor humidity could be one of the key factors explaining this.; Objective: The purpose of this study is to quantify the association between relevant epidemiological metrics and humidity in both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 epidemic periods.; Methods: The atmospheric dew point temperature serves as a proxy for indoor relative humidity. This study considered the weekly mortality rate in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2019 to determine the correlation between the dew point and the spread of influenza. During influenza epidemic periods in the Netherlands, governmental restrictions were absent; therefore, there is no need to control this confounder. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, governmental restrictions strongly varied over time. To control this effect, periods with a relatively constant governmental intervention level were selected to analyze the reproduction rate. We also examine SARS-CoV-2 deaths in the nursing home setting, where health policy and social factors were less variable. Viral transmissibility was measured by computing the ratio between the estimated daily number of infectious persons in the Netherlands and the lagged mortality figures in the nursing homes.; Results: For both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, a significant correlation was found between the dew point temperature and the aforementioned epidemiological metrics. The findings are consistent with the anticipated mechanisms related to droplet evaporation, stability of virus in the indoor environment, and impairment of the natural defenses of the respiratory tract in dry air.; Significance: This information is helpful to understand the seasonal pattern of respiratory viruses and motivate further study to what extent it is possible to alter the seasonal pattern by actively intervening in the adverse role of low humidity during fall and winter in temperate regions.; Impact: A solid understanding and quantification of the role of humidity on the transmission of respiratory viruses is imperative for epidemiological modeling and the installation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The results of this study indicate that improving the indoor humidity by humidifiers could be a promising technology for reducing the spread of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 during winter and fall in the temperate zone. The identification of this potential should be seen as a strong motivation to invest in further prospective testing of this non-pharmaceutical intervention. (Â© 2022.

Positively conditioning healthy foods and negatively conditioning unhealthy foods should result in healthier food choices. Of interest in the current research is the extent to which EC can generalize beyond the conditioned foods to entire dimensions underlying food judgment, such as health and taste. Method: The current research included 2 EC experiments configured in accord with the Implicit Misattribution Model (IMM; Jones, Fazio, &amp; Olson, 2009). Four healthy CS foods were paired with positive US and 4 unhealthy CS foods were paired with negative US. Participants then reported eating intentions for a variety of foods, including non-CS foods. Results: Experiment 1 demonstrated that conditioning a few exemplar food items increased sensitivity to health and decreased sensitivity to taste when judging a variety of additional foods. Experiment 2 replicated the generalization effect with regard to health sensitivity, but only when a task that preceded the EC procedure promoted, rather than interfered with, categorization of the CS foods by health. Conclusions: This research shows that EC can generalize to an entire dimension underlying food judgment and that this effect is facilitated by accessibility of the health dimension at the time of exposure to the EC pairings.

Contextual fear generalization is modeled in a laboratory paradigm in which one context (CTX+) is paired with an aversive unconditional stimulus (US), while the other context (CTX-) is not. The current study sought to validate a novel paradigm assessing contextual fear generalization, and to determine the extent to which stress and anxiety symptoms enhanced contextual fear generalization. Methods: Fifty-nine participants were randomized to a stress induction or control arithmetic test, followed by a differential context fear conditioning paradigm. One to three days later, participants completed a generalization gradient test with CTX +, CTX, and four generalization contexts. Results: We found successful contextual fear conditioning on measures of US expectancy, self-report fear and valence, and startle reflex, and linear generalization across the contextual gradient on expectancies and self-report measures. Acute stress induction impaired learning of the US-CTX + association during context fear acquisition. Anxiety significantly predicted greater contextual fear generalization as measured by US expectancy. Limitations: Our study provides pilot data introducing a novel fear conditioning paradigm to assess contextual generalization of fear. There is a need for further replication to validate its utility. Conclusions: Findings suggest that individuals high in anxiety show greater contextual fear generalization as measured by US expectancy. Results are discussed in terms of potential mechanisms that contribute to pervasive anxiety.

In psychiatry, reproducibility issues are compounded because the complex behavioral syndromes make many disorders challenging to model. We develop translatable tasks that quantitatively measure psychiatry-relevant behaviors across species. The behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) was designed to analyze exploratory behaviors, which are altered in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), especially during mania episodes. We have repeatedly assessed the behavioral effects of reduced dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in the BPM using a DAT knockdown (KD) mouse line (~10% normal expression). DAT KD mice exhibit a profile in the BPM consistent with acutely manic BD patients in the human version of the taskâhyperactivity, increased exploratory behavior, and reduced spatial d (Perry et al., 2009). We collected data from multiple DAT KD BPM experiments in our laboratory to assess the reproducibility of behavioral outcomes across experiments. The four outcomes analyzed were: 1) transitions (amount of locomotor activity); 2) rearings (exploratory activity); 3) holepokes (exploratory activity); and 4) spatial d (geometrical pattern of locomotor activity). By comparing DAT KD mice to wildtype (WT) littermates in every experiment, we calculated effect sizes for each of the four outcomes and then calculated a mean effect size using a random effects model. DAT KD mice exhibited robust, reproducible changes in each of the four outcomes, including increased transitions, rearings, and holepokes, and reduced spatial d, vs. WT littermates. Our results demonstrate that the DAT KD mouse line in the BPM is a consistent, reproducible model of mania-relevant behaviors. More work must be done to assess reproducibility of behavioral outcomes across experiments in order to advance the field of psychiatry and develop more effective therapeutics for patients.

In particular, researchers have taught individuals how to more accurately estimate portion sizes of foods using equivalence-based instruction (EBI). This area of research lacks information on the effects of using nonfood items during EBI. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether nonfood items could be used during training to increase portion-size estimation accuracy. Participants were three adult females. Preferred and nonpreferred foods were used to assess generalization of portion-size estimation accuracy. Foods were identified through an assessment and varied per participant. Two nonfood items were used for training and one novel nonfood item was to assess for generalization. Three classes of stimuli were taught using EBI (i.e., Â¼ cup, Â½ cup, and 1 cup). The members of each class were represented by portion-size measurement aids, amounts on paper plates, and measuring cups. All participants more accurately estimated each portion size of nonfood items after training sessions. Accurate estimation also generalized to preferred and nonpreferred foods, as well as a novel nonfood item, for all participants.

At the same time, researchers' degrees of freedom make it hard to assess the robustness of effects. Replication research can help evaluate how reproducible an effect is. We present the first replication in verbal deception research whereby ferry passengers were instructed to tell the truth or lie about their travel plans. The original study found truthâtellers to include more specific time references in their answers. The replication study that closely mimicked the setting, procedure, materials, coding, and analyses found no lieâtruth difference for specific time references. Although the power of our replication study was suboptimal (0.77), Bayesian statistics showed evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. Given the great applied consequences of verbal credibility tests, we hope this first replication attempt ignites much needed preregistered, highâpowered, multilab replication efforts.

Aims: This systematic review evaluated peer-reviewed single-case experimental design (SCED) studies concerning evidence of generalization and maintenance effects of tablet-based interventions for individuals with ASD. Methods: To evaluate the methodological rigor of the literature in terms of generalization and maintenance effects, the authors adopted four of the basic design standards developed by What Works Clearinghouse (WWC; Kratochwill et al., 2010/2014). In addition, the authors used Tau-U effect size measure and attempted to calculate effect sizes differentiated by the type of generalization and maintenance teaching strategies. Results: A total of 21 studies assessed generalization and/or maintenance effects. In the first evaluation of evidence of generalization and maintenance effects, it was found that more than half of the studies included in this review collected interobserver agreement (IOA) on at least 20% of sessions across all generalization and maintenance conditions and met the minimum quality thresholds of IOA. Meanwhile, less than one third of the studies included more than three data points in each generalization and maintenance condition. With regard to maintenance of effects, about half of the reviewed studies did not report the latency to the maintenance measure, which may hamper the assessment of the clinical and practical significance of the effect of the tablet-based intervention. In the second evaluation, the omnibus Tau-U effect size for baseline to generalization comparisons resulted in a moderate effect. For the contrasts between intervention and generalization comparisons resulted in a small effect. The omnibus Tau-U effect size for baseline and maintenance comparisons resulted in a strong effect. For the contrasts between intervention to maintenance comparisons, the omnibus Tau-U effect size resulted in a small effect. Conclusions and implication: Findings in this review suggest that efforts should be made to establish a system for appraising generalization and maintenance procedures in SCED studies. In addition, future studies should investigate if tablet-based interventions are truly effective in creating sustainable behavioral change in individuals with ASD.

Generalization errors encompass when the learner should extend the use of a newly taught behavior to other contexts but does not (under-generalization), as well as when he or she should not use the newly established behavior in new contexts but does (over-generalization). This study was designed to evaluate the generalization errors of a preschooler with ASD. Following an intervention in which the participant was taught to request assistance with difficult tasks using a continuous reinforcement schedule, generalization gradients across levels of task difficulty were implemented to examine patterns of generalization. Initial results showed over-generalization of assistance requests and corresponding reductions in independent (the absence of any instructional prompts) task completion across all levels of task difficulty. A final phase involving competing schedules of reinforcement for assistance requests and independent work with video modeling led to improved conditional use of assistance requests. Implications for teaching conditional use of assistance requests are discussed.

Furthermore, ectotherms acclimate to prevailing thermal conditions by adjusting physiological parameters, which often implies costs to other fitness-related parameters. Both predators and prey may therefore pay thermal acclimation costs following exposure to suboptimal temperatures. However, these costs may be asymmetrical between predator and prey, and between the predator and different species of concurrent prey. We investigated whether thermal pre-exposure affected subsequent kill rate and predator fitness when foraging on prey that differ in ease of capture, and whether changes were primarily caused by predator or by prey pre-exposure effects. Specifically, we were interested in whether there were interactions between predator pre-exposed temperature and specific prey. Using the mesostigmatid mite Gaeolaelaps aculeifer as a generalist predator and the collembolans Folsomia candida and Protaphorura fimata as prey, we measured the impact of present temperature, predator pre-exposure temperature, prey pre-exposure temperature (all 10 or 20Â°C), prey species, and all interactions on prey numbers killed, predator eggs produced, and exploitation of killed prey in a full factorial design. Mites killed P.Â fimata in equal numbers independent of the presence of F.Â candida, but killed F.Â candida when P.Â fimata was absent. Mite kill rate and reproduction were significantly affected by mite pre-exposure temperature and test temperature, but not by prey pre-exposure temperature. Significantly more of the slower prey was killed than of the quicker prey. Importantly, we found significant synergistic negative interaction effects between predator cold pre-exposure and hunting prey of higher agility on predator kill rate and reproduction. Our findings show that the negative effects of cold and cold pre-exposure on kill rate and reproduction may be more severe when predators forage on quick prey. The study implies that predator cold exposure has consequences for specific prey survival following cold due to altered predation pressures, which in nature should influence the specific prey population dynamics and apparent competition outcomes. The findings exemplify how not only current but also preceding conditions affect ecological interactions, and that effect strength depends on the species involved. (Â© 2018 The Authors.

We propose that the available data from research studies combined with provenance metadata provide a framework for evaluating scientific reproducibility. We developed the ProvCaRe platform to model, extract, and query semantic provenance information from 435, 248 published articles.; Methods: The ProvCaRe platform consists of: (1) the S3 model and a formal ontology; (2) a provenance-focused text processing workflow to generate provenance triples consisting of subject, predicate, and object using metadata extracted from articles; and (3) the ProvCaRe knowledge repository that supports "provenance-aware" hypothesis-driven search queries. A new provenance-based ranking algorithm is used to rank the articles in the search query results.; Results: The ProvCaRe knowledge repository contains 48.9 million provenance triples. Seven research hypotheses were used as search queries for evaluation and the resulting provenance triples were analyzed using five categories of provenance terms. The highest number of terms (34%) described provenance related to population cohort followed by 29% of terms describing statistical data analysis methods, and only 5% of the terms described the measurement instruments used in a study. In addition, the analysis showed that some articles included a higher number of provenance terms across multiple provenance categories suggesting a higher potential for reproducibility of these research studies.; Conclusion: The ProvCaRe knowledge repository (https://provcare.; Case: edu/) is one of the largest provenance resources for biomedical research studies that combines intuitive search functionality with a new provenance-based ranking feature to list articles related to a search query.

One possible reason is phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. The present study replicated genetic associations with MDD as defined in DSMâIV and with a more narrowly defined MDD subtype with a chronic and severe course. We first conducted a systematic review of genetic association studies on MDD published between September 2007 and June 2012 to identify all reported candidate genes. Genetic associations were then tested for all identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the entire genes using data from the GAIN genomeâwide association study (MDD: n = 1,352; chronic MDD subsample: n = 225; controls: n = 1,649). The 1,000 Genomes database was used as reference for imputation. From 157 studies identified inthe literature, 81 studies reported significant associations with MDD, involving 245 polymorphisms in 97 candidate genes, from which we were able to investigate 185 SNPs in 89 genes. We replicated nine candidate SNPs in eight genes for MDD and six in five genes for chronic MDD. However, these were not more than expected by chance. At gene level, we replicated 18 genes for MDD and 17 genes for chronic MDD, both significantly more than expected by chance. We showed that replication rates were improved for MDD compared to a previous, highly similar, replication study based on studies published before 2007. Effect sizes of the SNPs and replication rates of the candidate genes were improved in the chronic subsample compared to the full sample. Nonetheless, replication rates were still poor.

Drawing on critical realism, experimental replication is useful for assessing the generalizability of the treatment effects or for confirming treatment effects across diverse entrepreneurship settings. Yet, experiments in entrepreneurship have traditionally relied on single experimental trials and have not considered potential variance in treatment effects across contexts. Accounting for variance in treatment effects is even more pertinent under higher levels of environmental uncertainty. To help assess the contingent effects of treatments across contexts, we propose a set of methodological and statistical approaches for entrepreneurship researchers. Using different types of experimental replications and proposed statistical methods, one may draw inferences about treatment effects at the trial-, the treatment-, and at the individual-level. We illustrate the proposed approach using experimental replications across three randomized, post-test, experiments.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=1136636&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dreber, Anna</author><author>Pfeiffer, Thomas</author><author>Almenberg, Johan</author><author>Isaksson, Siri</author><author>Wilson, Brad</author><author>Chen, Yiling</author><author>Nosek, Brian A.</author><author>Johannesson, Magnus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using prediction markets to estimate the reproducibility of scientific research</title><secondary-title>PNAS Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PNAS Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>PNAS Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</abbr-1></periodical><pages>15343-15347</pages><volume>112</volume><number>50</number><issue>50</issue><keywords><keyword>Commerce</keyword><keyword>Experimental Methods</keyword><keyword>Experimental Replication</keyword><keyword>Experimentation</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>Prediction</keyword><keyword>prediction markets</keyword><keyword>Probability</keyword><keyword>replications</keyword><keyword>reproducibility</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Research</keyword><keyword>Science</keyword><keyword>Statistical Data</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-12-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1516179112</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Concerns about a lack of reproducibility of statistically significant results have recently been raised in many fields, and it has been argued that this lack comes at substantial economic costs. We here report the results from prediction markets set up to quantify the reproducibility of 44 studies published in prominent psychology journals and replicated in the Reproducibility Project: Psychology. The prediction markets predict the outcomes of the replications well and outperform a survey of market participantsâ individual forecasts. This shows that prediction markets are a promising tool for assessing the reproducibility of published scientific results. The prediction markets also allow us to estimate probabilities for the hypotheses being true at different testing stages, which provides valuable information regarding the temporal dynamics of scientific discovery. We find that the hypotheses being tested in psychology typically have low prior probabilities of being true (median, 9%) and that a 'statistically significant' finding needs to be confirmed in a well-powered replication to have a high probability of being true. We argue that prediction markets could be used to obtain speedy information about reproducibility at low cost and could potentially even be used to determine which studies to replicate to optimally allocate limited resources into replications.

This paper presents the methodology for conducting controlled experiment replication, as well as, results of a controlled experiment and an internal replication that investigated the effectiveness of intelligent authoring shell eXtended TutorâExpert System (xTEx-Sys). The initial and the replicated experiment were based on our approach that combines classical two-group experimental design and with factoral design. A trait that distinguishes this approach from others is the existence of arbitrary number of checkpoint-tests to determine the effectiveness in intermediate states. We call it a pre-and-post test control group experimental design with checkpoint-tests. The gained results revealed small or even negative effect sizes, which could be explained by the fact that the xTEx-Sysâs domain knowledge presentation is rather novel for students and therefore difficult to grasp and apply in earlier phases of the experiment. In order to develop and improve the xTEx-Sys, further experiments must be conducted.

Participants received positive information about one artwork and negative information about another artwork. Afterwards, we tested their evaluative responses not only to these artworks but also to similar artworks, which allowed us to assess generalization. Results showed that the artwork that was paired with positive information and the artwork that was similar to it were evaluated more positively than the other artworks. These findings confirm that theories that aim to explain art appreciation could benefit from taking learning and its generalization into account.

Across ethnicities, two common ABCA7 loci (rs115550680 and rs3764650) have been confirmed to increase the risk of AD. While ABCA7 rs115550680 has been linked to the development of late-onset AD in African Americans, no association between ABCA7 variant rs3764650 and AD has been found in this population. In order to elucidate the influence of ABCA7 rs3764650 on AD risk in African Americans, we sought to investigate the relationship between this variant, aerobic fitness, and cognition. The present study tested the hypothesis that in African Americans, ABCA7 rs3764650 confers an indirect risk for AD via its interaction with aerobic fitness, a modifiable lifestyle factor known to attenuate AD-related neuropathology. In a case-control sample of 100 healthy African Americans, we observed that ABCA7 rs3764650 genotype modulates the association between aerobic fitness and a cognitive assessment of generalization following rule learning. For carriers of the non-risk genotype, higher levels of aerobic fitness were significantly associated with fewer generalization errors, while carriers of the risk genotype did not show any relationship between aerobic fitness and generalization. Our findings imply that ABCA7 rs3764650 risk genotype may diminish the neuroprotective effects of aerobic fitness, and, they suggest differing risk patterns between cognitive decline and fitness by ABCA7 genotype. Thus, in African Americans the interactive effects of ABCA7 rs3764650 and aerobic fitness likely compound overall ABCA7-related AD risk, and may contribute to health disparities whereby African Americans are at a higher risk for dementia, with double the prevalence of AD.

Past reviews stressed study-design weaknesses of TBI researches. This systematic review has threefold purpose: 1) to update the previous ones with a focus on clinical-quality studies; 2) to examine reliability, consistency, durability and generalization of measurements; and 3) to compare the methodology of two cores of studies according to two dimensions: Therapeutic Effectiveness (TE) and Technology Usability (TU). From the 685 search results, 31 studies were selected (22 on TE, 6 on TU, and 3 on TE-TU). Overall, few studies reached the standards of evidence-based practices (reliability, consistency, durability, generalization). TE studies provided more evidence of their reliability than TU and TU-TE studies. Moreover, the examination of studies' results revealed that: 1) the more robust study designs, the less consistent TBI effect, 2) the more reliable the measure, the less large TBI-related effect size. Although less robust, TE-TU studies can be seen as an emerging interdisciplinary approach, combining expertise in human-computer interaction and clinical research.

While knowing shape names is considered important for school-readiness, many children do not understand the defining features of shapes until well into elementary school (Satlow &amp; Newcombe, 1998). One reason is likely that they do not encounter enough variety in the shapes they see (Resnick, Verdine, Golinkoff, &amp; Hirsh-Pasek, 2016). The present study observed 60 parents and their 3-year-old children during play with geometric toys, exploring how spatial language varied with the nature of the shape-toy set (canonical shapes versus a mix of canonical and unusual or less-canonical variants) and whether geometric shapes were presented as tangible, traditional toys or shown on a touchscreen tablet app. Although children in the app condition heard more shape names than the other conditions due to the language produced by the app itself, children used more overall words and more spatial language with tangible toys that included varied shapes. In addition, parents used more shape names with sons than with daughters and tended to adjust their use of spatial language more in response to varied shape sets with boys, although these findings need replication to evaluate generality. These data suggest that including non-canonical shapes in tangible shape toys may provide a low-cost, high-impact way of refining adult-child interactions that might facilitate childrenâs early geometric knowledge.

Recently, empirical interest in fear generalization as a transdiagnostic explanatory mechanism underlying anxiety-related disorders has accelerated. As there are now several studies of fear generalization across multiple types of anxiety-related disorders, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting behavioral measures (subjective ratings and psychophysiological indices) of fear generalization in anxiety-related disorder vs. comparison groups. We conducted systematic searches of electronic databases (conducted from January-October 2020) for fear generalization studies involving anxiety-related disorder groups or subclinical analog groups. A total of 300 records were full-text screened and two unpublished datasets were obtained, yielding 16 studies reporting behavioral fear generalization measures. Random-effects meta-analytic models and meta-regressions were applied to the identified data. Fear generalization was significantly heightened in anxiety-related disorder participants (Nâ=â439) relative to comparison participants (Nâ=â428). We did not identify any significant clinical, sample, or methodological moderators. Heightened fear generalization is quantitatively supported as distinguishing anxiety-related disorder groups from comparison groups. Evidence suggests this effect is transdiagnostic, relatively robust to experimental or sample parameters, and that generalization paradigms are a well-supported framework for neurobehavioral investigations of learning and emotion in anxiety-related disorders. We discuss these findings in the context of prior fear conditioning meta-analyses, past neuroimaging investigations of fear generalization in anxiety-related disorders, and future directions and challenges for the field.

While obtaining interpretable data from task-based functional MRI (fMRI) measures is common in compliant and awake patients, it is not known whether functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data show equivalent results. If this were the case, it would have substantial clinical and research generalizability. To evaluate this possibility, the authors evaluated the concordance between fMRI and fcMRI data collected in a presurgical epilepsy cohort.; Methods: Task-based fMRI data for autobiographical memory tasks and resting-state fcMRI data were collected in patients with epilepsy evaluated at Seattle Children's Hospital between 2010 and 2017. To assess memory-related activation and laterality, signal change in task-based measures was computed as a percentage of the average blood oxygen level-dependent signal over the defined regions of interest. An fcMRI data analysis was performed using 1000 Functional Connectomes Project scripts based on Analysis of Functional NeuroImages and FSL (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library) software packages. Lateralization indices (LIs) were estimated for activation and connectivity measures. The concordance between these two measures was evaluated using correlation and regression analysis.; Results: In this epilepsy cohort studied, the authors observed concordance between fMRI activation and fcMRI connectivity, with an LI regression coefficient of 0.470 (R2 = 0.221, p = 0.00076).; Conclusions: Previously published studies have demonstrated fMRI and fcMRI overlap between measures of vision, attention, and language. In the authors' clinical sample, task-based measures of memory and analogous resting-state mapping were similarly linked in pattern and strength. These results support the use of fcMRI methods as a proxy for task-based memory performance in presurgical patients, perhaps including those who are more limited in their behavioral compliance. Future investigations to extend these results will be helpful to explore how the magnitudes of effect are associated with neuropsychological performance and postsurgical behavioral changes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=35907201&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rauh, Shelby</author><author>Johnson, Bradley S</author><author>Bowers, Aaron</author><author>Tritz, Daniel</author><author>Vassar, Benjamin Matthew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A review of reproducible and transparent research practices in urology publications from 2014 to2018.</title><secondary-title>BMC urology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC urology</full-title><abbr-1>BMC urology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>102</pages><volume>22</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Replicability</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Transparency</keyword><keyword>Urologic research</keyword><keyword>Urology</keyword><keyword>Urology*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-07-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2490</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12894-022-01059-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Reproducibility is essential for the integrity of scientific research. Reproducibility is measured by the ability of different investigators to replicate the outcomes of an original publication using the same materials and procedures. Unfortunately, reproducibility is not currently a standard being met by most scientific research.; Methods: For this review, we sampled 300 publications in the field of urology to assess for 14 indicators of reproducibility including material availability, raw data availability, analysis script availability, pre-registration information, links to protocols, and if the publication was available free to the public. Publications were also assessed for statements about conflicts of interest and funding sources.; Results: Of the 300 sample publications, 171 contained empirical data available for analysis of reproducibility. Of the 171 articles with empirical data to analyze, 0.58% provided links to protocols, 4.09% provided access to raw data, 3.09% provided access to materials, and 4.68% were pre-registered. None of the studies provided analysis scripts. Our review is cross-sectional in nature, including only PubMed indexed journals-published in English-and within a finite time period. Thus, our results should be interpreted in light of these considerations.; Conclusion: Current urology research does not consistently provide the components needed to reproduce original studies. Collaborative efforts from investigators and journal editors are needed to improve research quality while minimizing waste and patient risk. (Â© 2022.

The primary outcome measure was disease generalization. A nomogram for predicting 1- and 2-year generalization probabilities was constructed using a stepwise Cox regression model. Nomogram performance was quantified using C-indexes and calibration curves. Two-year cumulative generalization rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method for distinct nomogram-stratified risk groups. The clinical usefulness of the nomogram was evaluated using decision curve analysis (DCA).; Result: The eligible patients were randomly divided into a development cohort (n=351, 70%) and a validation cohort (n=150, 30%). The final model included five variables: sex, onset age, repetitive nerve stimulation findings, acetylcholine receptor antibody test results, and thymic status. The model demonstrated good discrimination (C-indexes of 0.733 and 0.788 in the development and validation cohorts, respectively) and calibration, with good agreement between actual and nomogram-estimated generalization probabilities. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed higher 2-year cumulative generalization rates in the high-risk group than that in the low-risk group. DCA demonstrated a higher net benefit of nomogram-assisted decisions compared to treatment of all patients or none.; Conclusion: The nomogram model can predict 1- and 2-year generalization probabilities in patients with OMG and stratified these patients into distinct generalization risk groups. The nomogram has potential to aid neurologists in selecting suitable patients for initiating immunotherapy and for enrolment in clinical trials of risk-modifying treatments.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis was performed by logistic regression models, controlling for age, gender, body mass index, and the first 3 genetic principal components. Gene-based analysis was conducted by combining SNP-based p values using effective Chi-square test method. Promising SNPs (p &lt; 1Ã10-5) and genes (p &lt; 1Ã10-4) were further evaluated for replication among 514 White participants of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). To accommodate familial correlations, generalized estimation equation models were applied for SNP-based analyses in the FHS. Analysis results across ARIC and FHS were combined using inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis method for SNPs and Fisher's method for genes. We robustly identified 5 novel genes that are associated with prediabetes status change using gene-based analyses, including SGCZ (ARIC p = 9.93Ã10-6, FHS p = 2.00Ã10-3, Meta p = 3.72Ã10-7) at 8p22, HPSE2 (ARIC p = 8.26Ã10-19, FHS p = 5.85Ã10-3, Meta p &lt; 8.26Ã10-19) at 10q24.2, ADGRA1 (ARIC p = 1.34Ã10-5, FHS p = 1.13Ã10-3, Meta p = 2.88Ã10-7) at 10q26.3, GLB1L3 (ARIC p = 3.71Ã10-6, FHS p = 4.51Ã10-3, Meta p = 3.16Ã10-7) at 11q25, and PCSK6 (ARIC p = 6.51Ã10-6, FHS p = 1.10Ã10-2, Meta p = 1.25Ã10-6) at 15q26.3. eQTL analysis indicated that these genes were highly expressed in tissues related to diabetes development. However, we were not able to identify any novel locus in single SNP-based analysis. Future large scale genomic studies of prediabetes status change are warranted.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Such outcomes often include health care spending, and utilization of care services. Building accurate prediction models using reproducible research practices for health services research is important for evidence-based decision making. Several systematic reviews have summarized prediction models for outcomes relevant to health services research, but these systematic reviews do not present a thorough assessment of reproducibility and research quality of the prediction modelling studies. In the present commentary, we discuss how recent advances in prediction modelling in other medical fields can be applied to health services research.

These bacteria have peculiar ribosomal structures, reduced metabolic capacities, small genome, and cell sizes, and a general host-associated lifestyle was proposed for the radiation. So far, most CPR genomes were obtained from groundwaters; however, their diversity, abundance, and role in surface freshwaters is largely unexplored. Here, we attempt to close these knowledge gaps by deep metagenomic sequencing of 119 samples of 17 different freshwater lakes located in Europe and Asia. Moreover, we applied Fluorescence in situ Hybridization followed by Catalyzed Reporter Deposition (CARD-FISH) for a first visualization of distinct CPR lineages in freshwater samples.; Results: A total of 174 dereplicated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of diverse CPR lineages were recovered from the investigated lakes, with a higher prevalence from hypolimnion samples (162 MAGs). They have reduced genomes (median size 1 Mbp) and were generally found in low abundances (0.02-14.36 coverage/Gb) and with estimated slow replication rates. The analysis of genomic traits and CARD-FISH results showed that the radiation is an eclectic group in terms of metabolic capabilities and potential lifestyles, ranging from what appear to be free-living lineages to host- or particle-associated groups. Although some complexes of the electron transport chain were present in the CPR MAGs, together with ion-pumping rhodopsins and heliorhodopsins, we believe that they most probably adopt a fermentative metabolism. Terminal oxidases might function in O 2 scavenging, while heliorhodopsins could be involved in mitigation against oxidative stress.; Conclusions: A high diversity of CPR MAGs was recovered, and distinct CPR lineages did not seem to be limited to lakes with specific trophic states. Their reduced metabolic capacities resemble the ones described for genomes in groundwater and animal-associated samples, apart from Gracilibacteria that possesses more complete metabolic pathways. Even though this radiation is mostly host-associated, we also observed organisms from different clades (ABY1, Paceibacteria, Saccharimonadia) that appear to be unattached to any other organisms or were associated with 'lake snow' particles (ABY1, Gracilibacteria), suggesting a broad range of potential life-strategies in this phylum.

The fragility index was proposed to quantify the robustness of statistical significance of clinical studies with binary outcomes. It is defined as the minimal event status modifications that can alter statistical significance. It helps clinicians evaluate the reliability of the conclusions. Many factors may affect the fragility index, including the treatment groups in which event status is modified, the statistical methods used for testing for the association between treatments and outcomes, and the pre-specified significance level. In addition to assessing the fragility of individual studies, the fragility index was recently extended to both conventional pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses of multiple treatment comparisons. It is not straightforward for clinicians to calculate these measures and visualize the results. We have developed an R package called "fragility" to offer user-friendly functions for such purposes. This article provides an overview of methods for assessing and visualizing the fragility of individual studies as well as pairwise and network meta-analyses, introduces the usage of the "fragility" package, and illustrates the implementations with several worked examples.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=35648746&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pouil, Simon</author><author>Stevenson, Louise M</author><author>GoÃ±ez-RodrÃ­guez, Leroy</author><author>Mathews, Teresa J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stannous chloride as a tool for mercury stripping in contaminated streams: Experimental assessment of toxicity in an invertebrate model species.</title><secondary-title>Chemosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemosphere</full-title><abbr-1>Chemosphere</abbr-1></periodical><pages>133762</pages><volume>296</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Ceriodaphnia dubia</keyword><keyword>Chronic toxicity</keyword><keyword>Cladocera*</keyword><keyword>Hg</keyword><keyword>Mercury*/toxicity</keyword><keyword>Rivers</keyword><keyword>SnCl(2)</keyword><keyword>Tin</keyword><keyword>Tin Compounds</keyword><keyword>Water Pollutants, Chemical*/analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1879-1298</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133762</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The chronic toxicity of an innovative Hg water treatment system using tin (Sn) (II) chloride (SnCl 2 ) followed by air stripping was assessed through measurements of survival, growth, and reproduction rate in the freshwater cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia, a model species for toxicity testing. We first calculated the concentrations of Hg causing 25% reduction in survival and reproduction (Lethal or Inhibition Concentrations, or LC 25 and IC 25 , for survival and reproduction, respectively) through exposure to aqueous Hg at concentrations ranging from 0 to 25,000Â ngÂ L -1 . Then, we treated media (DMW and natural stream water) contaminated with Hg at LC 25 and IC 25 concentrations with SnCl 2 at a Sn:Hg stoichiometric ratio of 8:1 and air stripping and exposed C. dubia to this Sn-amended media. Our results showed that Hg significantly affected survival, reproduction rates and impaired growth. SnCl 2 -treatment removed 100% of the Hg from the media at all concentrations tested with no deleterious effects on survival, growth and reproduction. Our results confirmed the efficacy of SnCl 2 in removing aqueous Hg from stream water and showed that the added Sn did not impact C. dubia at the concentrations tested, supporting the suitability of SnCl 2 -based treatments in appropriate Hg-contaminated environments.

Such practices have been implicated in the low rates of reproducible results found in large scale replication studies in psychology. What are the causes and the prevalence of QRPs? In the present paper we present the work by John, Loewenstein, and Prelec (2012) who surveyed academic psychologists at U.S. universities and found that a surprisingly large percentage had engaged in QRPs. We investigated the prevalence of the same QRPs studied by John et al. among Italian psychologists (members of the Association of Italian Psychologists). The results were strikingly similar to those obtained for U.S. psychologists, showing that QRPs are about equally widespread in both research communities. The similarity of results obtained in the United States, this Italian study, and a related study conducted in Germany, suggests that adoption of these practices is an international phenomenon and is likely due to systemic features of the international research and publication processes.

There is no consensus on a valid PD subtype classification system, and its use in clinical research is sparse. Reproducibility has not been systematically assessed as a step for the validation of a PD subtype classification system. We aimed at assessing reproducibility of previously published data-driven PD subtype classification systems in a well-characterized cohort created for clinical research purposes, the Longitudinal and Biomarker Study in Parkinson's Disease (LABS-PD). Methods: We identified all published studies of data-driven PD subtype classification systems and included those with variables that conceptually matched the variables available in LABS-PD. We reproduced the cluster analyses of the included studies in LABS-PD. Reproducibility was determined by a panel of experts using a modified Delphi consensus process. Results: We included eight studies of data-driven PD subtype classification systems and completed the replication in LABS-PD of the analyses conducted in each original study. After two iterations of the modified Delphi consensus process, no study was reproducible in LABS-PD. Conclusions: Currently published data-driven PD subtype classification systems lack reproducibility in a well-characterized cohort of patients initially recruited for a clinical trial of a disease-modifying intervention. The results raise concerns about the utility of the widely-discussed concept of data-driven PD subtypes. This gap is a barrier for a meaningful use of PD subtypes and calls for the establishment of standards for the validation and use of these subtype classification systems.

In this study, we compared the efficacy of an explicit approach to an implicit approach when teaching 3 novel grammatical forms varying in linguistic complexity. Method: The study included twenty-five 5- to 8-year-old children with developmental language disorder, 13 of whom were randomized to receive an implicit-only (I-O) intervention whereas the remaining 12 participants were randomized to receive a combined explicitâimplicit (E-I) intervention to learn 3 novel grammatical forms. On average, participants completed 4.5 teaching sessions for each form across 9 days. Acquisition was assessed during each teaching session. Approximately 9 days posttreatment for each form, participants completed probes to assess maintenance and generalization. Results: Analyses revealed a meaningful and statistically significant learning advantage for the E-I group on acquisition, maintenance, and generalization measures when performance was collapsed across the 3 novel targets (p &lt; .02, Î¦s &gt; 0.60). Significant differences between the groups, with the E-I group outperforming the I-O group, only emerged for 1 of the 3 target forms. However, all effect sizes ranged from medium to large (Î¦s = 0.25â0.76), and relative risk calculations all exceeded 0, indicating a greater likelihood of learning the target form with E-I instruction than I-O instruction. Conclusions: Study findings indicate that, as compared to implicit instruction, children are more likely to acquire, maintain, and generalize novel grammatical forms when taught with explicit instruction. Further research is needed to evaluate the use of explicit instruction when teaching true grammatical forms to children with language impairment.

A finding is elevated from single observation to scientific evidence when the procedures that were used to obtain it can be reproduced and the finding itself can be replicated. Recent replication attempts show that some high profile resultsâmost notably in psychology, but in many other disciplines as wellâcannot be replicated consistently. These replication attempts have generated a considerable amount of controversy, and the issue of whether direct replications have value has, in particular, proven to be contentious. However, much of this discussion has occurred in published commentaries and social media outlets, resulting in a fragmented discourse. To address the need for an integrative summary, we review various types of replication studies and then discuss the most commonly voiced concerns about direct replication. We provide detailed responses to these concerns and consider different statistical ways to evaluate replications. We conclude there are no theoretical or statistical obstacles to making direct replication a routine aspect of psychological science.

We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.

In psychiatric genetics specifically, targeting intermediate brain phenotypes, which are more closely associated with putative genetic effects, was touted as a strategy leading to increased power and replicability. In the current study, we attempted to replicate previously published associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and threat-related amygdala reactivity, which represents a robust brain phenotype not only implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple disorders, but also used as a biomarker of future risk. Methods: We conducted a literature search for published associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and threat-related amygdala reactivity and found 37 unique findings. Our replication sample consisted of 1117 young adult volunteers (629 women, mean age 19.72 Â± 1.25 years) for whom both genetic and functional magnetic resonance imaging data were available. Results: Of the 37 unique associations identified, only three replicated as previously reported. When exploratory analyses were conducted with different model parameters compared to the original findings, significant associations were identified for 28 additional studies: eight of these were for a different contrast/laterality; five for a different gender and/or race/ethnicity; and 15 in the opposite direction and for a different contrast, laterality, gender, and/or race/ethnicity. No significant associations, regardless of model parameters, were detected for six studies. Notably, none of the significant associations survived correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: We discuss these patterns of poor replication with regard to the general strategy of targeting intermediate brain phenotypes in genetic association studies and the growing importance of advancing the replicability of imaging genetics findings.

We conducted a multicenter randomized trial comparing 12 weeks of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) combined with exercise therapy (ET) to ET alone. Participants were 185 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years with chronic LBP. The primary outcome was LBP severity at 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included disability, quality of life, medication use, patient- and caregiver-rated improvement, and satisfaction. Outcomes were analyzed using longitudinal linear mixed effect models. An omnibus test assessing differences in individual outcomes over the entire year controlled for multiplicity. Of the 185 enrolled patients, 179 (97%) provided data at 12 weeks and 174 (94%) at 26 and 52 weeks. Adding SMT to ET resulted in a larger reduction in LBP severity over the course of 1 year (P = 0.007). The group difference in LBP severity (0-10 scale) was small at the end of treatment (mean difference = 0.5; P = 0.08) but was larger at weeks 26 (mean difference = 1.1; P = 0.001) and 52 (mean difference = 0.8; P = 0.009). At 26 weeks, SMT with ET performed better than ET alone for disability (P = 0.04) and improvement (P = 0.02). The SMT with ET group reported significantly greater satisfaction with care at all time points (P â¤ 0.02). There were no serious treatment-related adverse events. For adolescents with chronic LBP, spinal manipulation combined with exercise was more effective than exercise alone over a 1-year period, with the largest differences occurring at 6 months. These findings warrant replication and evaluation of cost effectiveness.

This study aimed to explore the association between duration of Early Childhood Education attendance (one or two years) and developmental outcomes in the 3rd grade. A total of 151 students from public schools participated in the study and their academic performance, social skills, externalizing behavior and stress symptoms were assessed. Data analysis comprised group comparison and regression with control of socioeconomic background. The results showed that children who had attended Early Childhood Education for one more year showed better achievement and less stress symptoms. Duration of Early Childhood Education attendance was a significant positive predictor for achievement and a negative one for stress in the 3rd grade. We discuss the quality of Early Childhood Education and its influence on the variables assessed and point to the need for a systematic replication study to assess the generalization of the results.

Generalized matching happens when the subjectâs response is controlled by these relations even when novel stimuli are presented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the moment when the identity and oddity relations are generalized, considering how many pairs of stimuli are needed for demonstrating generalization. Six male Wistar rats were trained on an oddity matching-to-sample procedure, and four were trained on an identity matching-to-sample. The olfactory stimuli were cups filled with scented sand in which the rats should dig to obtain a sugar pellet according to either the identity or oddity contingency. The experiment was divided into three phases, each having the training of one pair of stimuli and, after meeting the training criteria, a generalization test with novel stimuli. For this experiment, generalization is considered if the subject matched consistently according to the trained relation in at least 91,67% of the trials during the last testing session of each phase. The experiment ended when generalization was demonstrated in any of the three phases. The applied training showed to be more effective for oddity than for identity relations since the oddity group learned the trained relations faster and five of the rats were able to demonstrate generalization according to the defined testing criteria. Also, within the oddity group, there were rats that demonstrated generalization with less training than three pairs of stimuli, indicating that training with a large number of stimuli is not necessary to show generalized oddity relations. For the identity group, the number of training sessions was higher and only one rat met the testing criteria. Another problem addressed in this study is the effect of the contingency used during testing sessions over the subjectâs performance. Tests under extinction decreased the choice response rate after a few trials. Tests under an undifferentiated reinforcement contingency solved this problem, however, they donât eliminate the possibility of discrimination between training and testing sessions, what also could impair the evaluation of generalization. The results indicate the need for further investigations on better ways to evaluate generalization and on the difference in the acquisition of the oddity and identity relations.

Typically, several marginally significant lod scores or elevated lod scores are observed in a genome-wide screen. However, it is usually difficult to differentiate these findings from false positives (type I errors). Two approaches are commonly used to guard against false positives: replication studies in independent samples and combined data analysis. In the current paper, we evaluated these two common approaches using simulated data where data from multiple groups were available and locations of disease genes were known. We found replication studies and combined data analysis performed similarly in terms of their ability to identify true and false positive linkages. Both approaches confirmed two true linkages and did not confirm any false positive linkages. The results also indicated that it is not appropriate to apply the criteria proposed for confirming significant evidence for linkage to confirm regions with only suggestive evidence for linkage. The current results support previous findings that parametric analysis using an incorrect genetic model can still identify a true linkage.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10597529&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kottler, Ezra J</author><author>Gedan, Keryn B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sexual reproduction is light-limited as marsh grasses colonize maritime forest.</title><secondary-title>American journal of botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of botany</full-title><abbr-1>American journal of botany</abbr-1></periodical><pages>514-525</pages><volume>109</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate Change</keyword><keyword>ecotone</keyword><keyword>Forests</keyword><keyword>high marsh</keyword><keyword>intraspecific variation</keyword><keyword>maritime forest</keyword><keyword>marsh migration</keyword><keyword>Poaceae</keyword><keyword>Poaceae*</keyword><keyword>range edge</keyword><keyword>Reproduction</keyword><keyword>sea-level rise</keyword><keyword>Spartina</keyword><keyword>Wetlands*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1537-2197</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ajb2.1831</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Climate change is driving abiotic shifts that can threaten the conservation of foundation species and the habitats they support. Directional range shifting is one mechanism of escape, but requires the successful colonization of habitats where interspecific interactions may differ from those to which a species has adapted. For plants with multiple reproductive strategies, these range-edge interactions may alter the investment or allocation toward a given reproductive strategy. In this study, we quantified sexual reproduction of the clonal marsh grass Spartina patens across an inland colonization front into maritime forest being driven by sea-level rise. We find that flowering is variable across S. patens meadows, but consistently reduced in low light conditions like those of the forest understory. Observational surveys of S. patens flowering at four sites in the Delmarva Peninsula agreed with the results of two experimental manipulations of light availability (shading experiment in S. patens-dominated marsh and a forest dieback manipulation). These three approaches pinpointed light limitation as a principal control on S. patens flowering capacity, suggesting that light competition with taller upland species can suppress S. patens flowering along its upland migration front. Consequently, all propagation in shaded conditions must occur clonally or via seeds from the marsh, a reproductive restriction that could limit the potential for local adaptation and reduce genetic diversity. Future research is needed to determine whether the lack of flowering is the result of a trade-off between sexual and clonal reproduction or results from insufficient photosynthetic products needed to achieve either reproductive method.

Anxiety symptomatology severity along different dimensions (generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social anxiety, and panic symptoms) was measured using parental and self-reports. Participants completed differential threat acquisition and extinction using an age-appropriate threat conditioning task. They then returned to the lab after 7-10 days to complete an extinction recall task that also assessed threat generalization. Results indicated that more severe overall anxiety was associated with greater cognitive and physiological threat responses during acquisition, extinction, and extinction recall. During acquisition and extinction, all anxiety dimensions manifested greater cognitive threat responses, while panic, separation anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms, but not generalized anxiety, were related to heightened physiological threat responses. In contrast, when we assessed generalization of cognitive threat responses, we found only generalized anxiety symptoms were associated with greater threat response generalization. The study provides preliminary evidence of specificity in threat responses during threat learning across youth with different anxiety symptoms. (Copyright Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Reproducibility of clinical research has received relatively little scientific attention. However, it is important as it may inform clinical practice, research agendas, and the design of future studies.; Methods: We used scoping review methods to examine reproducibility within a cohort of randomized trials examining clinical critical care research and published in the top general medical and critical care journals. To identify relevant clinical practices, we searched the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, and JAMA for randomized trials published up to April 2016. To identify a comprehensive set of studies for these practices, included articles informed secondary searches within other high-impact medical and specialty journals. We included late-phase randomized controlled trials examining therapeutic clinical practices in adults admitted to general medical-surgical or specialty intensive care units (ICUs). Included articles were classified using a reproducibility framework. An original study was the first to evaluate a clinical practice. A reproduction attempt re-evaluated that practice in a new set of participants.; Results: Overall, 158 practices were examined in 275 included articles. A reproduction attempt was identified for 66 practices (42%, 95% CI 33-50%). Original studies reported larger effects than reproduction attempts (primary endpoint, risk difference 16.0%, 95% CI 11.6-20.5% vs. 8.4%, 95% CI 6.0-10.8%, P = 0.003). More than half of clinical practices with a reproduction attempt demonstrated effects that were inconsistent with the original study (56%, 95% CI 42-68%), among which a large number were reported to be efficacious in the original study and to lack efficacy in the reproduction attempt (34%, 95% CI 19-52%). Two practices reported to be efficacious in the original study were found to be harmful in the reproduction attempt.; Conclusions: A minority of critical care practices with research published in high-profile journals were evaluated for reproducibility; less than half had reproducible effects.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29463308&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shi, Changzheng</author><author>Zhang, Dong</author><author>Xiao, Zeyu</author><author>Wang, Li</author><author>Ma, Rong</author><author>Chen, Hanwei</author><author>Luo, Liangping</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ultrahigh b-values MRI in normal human prostate: Initial research on reproducibility and age-related differences.</title><secondary-title>Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI</abbr-1></periodical><pages>801-812</pages><volume>46</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>age-related</keyword><keyword>DWI</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>normal prostate</keyword><keyword>Prostate/*anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>reproducibility</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1522-2586</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmri.25629</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: To investigate the reproducibility of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with ultrahigh b-values, and analyze the age-related differences in normal prostates.; Materials and Methods: In all, 67 healthy participants were divided into three age groups (group A, 15-30 years; group B, 31-50 years; group C, â¥51 years), and underwent DWI scanning twice with 15 b-factors from 0 to 3000 at 3.0T. Triexponential fits were applied to calculate the molecular diffusion coefficient (D), the pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), the ultrahigh apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC uh ), and perfusion fraction (f). The interobserver and short-term interscan reproducibility were evaluated, and the change in these parameters with age were assessed.; Results: The D, ADC uh , and f values presented good to excellent reproducibility. With increasing age, a trend of increasing D values was observed, with significant difference in both peripheral zone (PZ, Pâ=â0.01) and central gland (CG, Pâ=â0.01) of normal prostate tissue. The f value increased in the CG beginning at 50 years of age while the ADC uh value decreased in the PZ after 50 years of age; all of them showed significant differences between groups A and C and groups B and C (Pâ=â0.01/0.01).; Conclusion: The D, ADC uh , and f values have good to excellent reproducibility in the normal prostate, and these values change with age. The ultrahigh b-values magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide additional information (ADC uh ), which is different from the IVIM (intravoxel incoherent motion)-derived parameters.; Level of Evidence: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J.

In this paper, we introduce an adaptation of the notion of algorithmic robustness (previously introduced by Xu and Mannor) that can be used to derive generalization bounds for metric learning. We further show that a weak notion of robustness is in fact a necessary and sufficient condition for a metric learning algorithm to generalize. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework, we derive generalization results for a large family of existing metric learning algorithms, including some sparse formulations that are not covered by the previous results.

Reliability generalization (T. Vacha-Hasse; see record [rid]1997-39017-001[/rid]) was used to explore the sources for variability of reliability estimates and the amount of measurement error (ME) in the BDI scores. Only 7.5% of the 1,200 articles reviewed reported meaningful reliability estimates, indicating that the logic of 'test score reliability' generally has not prevailed in clinical psychology regarding application of BDI. Analyses revealed that for BDI, the ME due to time sampling as captured by test-retest reliability estimate is considerably larger than the ME due to item heterogeneity and content sampling as captured by internal consistency reliability estimate. Also, reliability estimates involving substance addicts were consistently lower than reliability estimates involving normal Ss, possibly due to restriction of range problems. Correlation analyses revealed that standard errors of measurement (SEMs) were not correlated with reliability estimates but were substantially related to standard deviations of BDI scores, suggesting that SEMs should be considered in addition to reliability estimates when interpreting individual BDI scores.

A total of 848 coefficients of stability and 1,359 internal consistency reliabilities across the Big Five factors of personality were examined. The frequency-weighted mean coefficients of stability were.75 (SDâ=â.10, Kâ=â221), .76 (SDâ=â.12, Kâ=â176), .71 (SDâ=â.13, Kâ=â139), .69 (SDâ=â.14, Kâ=â119), and .72 (SDâ=â.13, Kâ=â193) for Emotional Stability, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, respectively. The corresponding internal consistency reliabilities were.78 (SDâ=â.11, Kâ=â370), .78 (SDâ=â.09, Kâ=â307), .73 (SDâ=â.12, Kâ=â251), .75 (SDâ=â.11, Kâ=â123), and .78 (SDâ=â.10, Kâ=â307). Sample-size-weighted means also were computed. The dimension of personality being rated does not appear to strongly moderate either the internal consistency or the test-retest reliabilities.

We identify a need to move from programs to principles in intervention research and encourage the implementation of research on potential mechanisms underlying intervention effectiveness. In addition, current methodological issues in intervention research are highlighted, including advancements in methodology and statistical procedures, extended outcome assessments, replication studies, and a thorough examination of potential biases. We further discuss transfer-related issues, for example the need for more research on the flexibility and adaptability of programs and intervention approaches as well as more general problems in knowledge translation reasoning the need for enhanced communication between practitioners, policy makers, and researchers. Finally, we briefly touch on the need to discuss the relation between single intervention programs, the mental health system, and changes of contextual conditions at the macro level.

For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80%, whereas in practice less than 40% of the studies selected from different areas of psychology can be replicated. Researchers in cognitive psychology are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants. Our analyses can easily be applied to new datasets gathered.

This, and heterogeneity of studied outcome measures, limits generalizability and eligibility of results for meta-analysis.; Study Design Size Duration: For this review, a systematic search for RCTs on pain relief during oocyte retrieval was performed on 20 July 2020 in CENTRAL CRSO, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, Web of Science, Portal Regional da BVS and Open Grey.; Participants/materials Setting Methods: RCTs with pain or patient satisfaction as an outcome were included and analysed on a set of methodological and clinical characteristics, to determine their validity and usefulness.; Main Results and the Role of Chance: Screening of 2531 articles led to an inclusion of 51 RCTs. Randomization was described inadequately in 33% of the RCTs. A low-risk method of allocation concealment was reported in 55% of the RCTs. Forty-nine percent of the RCTs reported blinding of participants, 33% of blinding personnel and 43% of blinding the outcome assessor. In 63% of the RCTs, the primary outcome was stated, but a sample size calculation was described in only 57%. Data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle in 73%. Treatment groups were not treated identically other than the intervention of interest in 10% of the RCTs. The primary outcome was intraoperative pain in 28%, and postoperative pain in 2%. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was the most used pain scale, in 69% of the RCTs in which pain was measured. Overall, nine other scales were used. Patient satisfaction was measured in 49% of the RCTs, for which 12 different methods were used. Occurrence of side-effects and complications were assessed in 77% and 49% of the RCTs: a definition for these was lacking in 13% and 20% of the RCTs, respectively. Pregnancy rate was reported in 55% of the RCTs and, of these, 75% did not adequately define pregnancy. To improve the quality of future research, we provide recommendations for the design of future trials. These include use of the VAS for pain measurement, use of validated questionnaires for measurement of patient satisfaction and the minimal clinically relevant difference to use for sample size calculations.; Limitations Reasons for Caution: Consensus has not been reached on some methodological characteristics, for which we formulated recommendations. To prevent further heterogeneity in research on this topic, recommendations were formulated based on expert opinion, or on the most used method thus far. Future research may provide evidence to base new recommendations on.; Wider Implications of the Findings: Use of the recommendations given for design of trials on this topic can increase the generalizability of future research, increasing eligibility for meta-analyses and preventing wastefulness.; Study Funding/competing Interests: No specific funding was obtained for this study.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the host cell transcriptional machinery to induce a phenotypic state amenable to its replication. Specifically, analysis of Master Regulator (MR) proteins representing mechanistic determinants of the gene expression signature induced by SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells revealed coordinated inactivation of MRs enriched in physical interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, suggesting their mechanistic role in maintaining a host cell state refractory to virus replication. To test their functional relevance, we measured SARS-CoV-2 replication in epithelial cells treated with drugs predicted to activate the entire repertoire of repressed MRs, based on their experimentally elucidated, context-specific mechanism of action. Overall, &gt;80% of drugs predicted to be effective by this methodology induced significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 replication, without affecting cell viability. This model for host-directed pharmacological therapy is fully generalizable and can be deployed to identify drugs targeting host cell-based MR signatures induced by virtually any pathogen.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=35132404&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shartova, Natalia</author><author>Mironova, Varvara</author><author>Zelikhina, Svetlana</author><author>Korennoy, Fedor</author><author>Grishchenko, Mikhail</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial patterns of West Nile virus distribution in the Volgograd region of Russia, a territory with long-existing foci.</title><secondary-title>PLoS neglected tropical diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS neglected tropical diseases</full-title><abbr-1>PLoS neglected tropical diseases</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e0010145</pages><volume>16</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aedes/classification</keyword><keyword>Aedes/virology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anopheles/classification</keyword><keyword>Anopheles/virology</keyword><keyword>Argasidae/virology</keyword><keyword>Birds/*virology</keyword><keyword>Culex/classification</keyword><keyword>Culex/virology</keyword><keyword>Culicidae/*virology</keyword><keyword>Environment</keyword><keyword>Geography</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Ixodidae/virology</keyword><keyword>Population Density</keyword><keyword>Russia/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Spatial Analysis</keyword><keyword>Temperature</keyword><keyword>Ticks/*virology</keyword><keyword>West Nile Fever/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>West Nile Fever/*transmission</keyword><keyword>West Nile virus/isolation &amp; purification</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-01-31</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1935-2735</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pntd.0010145</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Southern Russia remains affected by West Nile virus (WNV). In the current study, we identified the spatial determinants of WNV distribution in an area with endemic virus transmission, with special reference to the urban settings, by mapping probable points of human infection acquisition and points of virus detection in mosquitoes, ticks, birds, and mammals during 1999-2016. The suitability of thermal conditions for extrinsic virus replication was assessed based on the approach of degree-day summation and their changes were estimated by linear trend analysis. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the year-to-year variation of human cases versus thermal conditions. Environmental suitability was determined by ecological niche modelling using MaxEnt software. Human population density was used as an offset to correct for possible bias. Spatial analysis of virus detection in the environment showed significant contributions from surface temperature, altitude, and distance from water bodies. When indicators of location and mobility of the human population were included, the relative impact of factors changed, with roads becoming most important. When the points of probable human case infection were added, the percentage of leading factors changed only slightly. The urban environment significantly increased the epidemic potential of the territory and created quite favorable conditions for virus circulation. The private building sector with low-storey houses and garden plots located in the suburbs provided a connection between urban and rural transmission cycles.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=35100289&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McKeon, Grace</author><author>Papadopoulos, Emelia</author><author>Firth, Joseph</author><author>Joshi, Rohina</author><author>Teasdale, Scott</author><author>Newby, Jill</author><author>Rosenbaum, Simon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social media interventions targeting exercise and diet behaviours in people with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs): A systematic review.</title><secondary-title>Internet interventions</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Internet interventions</full-title><abbr-1>Internet interventions</abbr-1></periodical><pages>100497</pages><volume>27</volume><keywords><keyword>Diet</keyword><keyword>Non-communicable diseases</keyword><keyword>Physical activity</keyword><keyword>Social media</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022-01-28</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2214-7829</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.invent.2022.100497</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death globally. Promoting physical activity and healthy eating is essential to help manage the NCD burden and reduce mortality. Social media may be a potential platform for delivering and scaling health promotion initiatives. In this systematic review, we aimed to examine i) the feasibility and acceptability of social media interventions targeting physical activity and/or diet for people with NCDs, ii) the effectiveness of improving exercise and diet behaviours, iii) specific design components used to promote user engagement and iv) the effectiveness on other health outcomes.; Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SPORTDiscus from inception until June 2021. Social media interventions targeting physical activity and/or diet were included. Participants were any age, with a diagnosis of one of the following categories of NCDs; cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or mental illness. Interventions using social media alone or as part of an intervention with other modes of delivery were included. Eligible study designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials, feasibility or pilot studies, or quasi-experimental studies.; Results: A total of 2358 publications were identified. After removal of duplicates, 2233 publication titles and abstracts were screened, and 10 publications were eligible, describing 8 individual studies. The study designs included five RCTs and three pilot or feasibility studies, all published between 2016 and 2020. Sample sizes ranged from nÂ =Â 11 to nÂ =Â 312. Half of the studies were conducted in the United States of America. Clinical populations included severe mental illness (2 studies), cardiovascular disease (2 studies), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2 studies), cancer (1 study) and Type 2 diabetes (1 study). Facebook (three studies) and WeChat (three studies) were the most used social media platforms. The majority utilised social media to deliver health education and facilitate social support and all studies reported &gt;70% retention. Four of the five included RCTS reported significant improvements in exercise behaviours (e.g., step count, exercise capacity) while diet was only assessed in two studies and results were non-significant.; Conclusions: Social media interventions appear to be feasible and acceptable among specific NCD populations and preliminary evidence suggests interventions they may be effective for improving exercise behaviours. The evidence for diet behaviours remains unclear. While overall there is an emerging evidence base, more rigorous evaluation including replication studies are needed to determine the efficacy of social media interventions.; Competing Interests: JF is supported by a UK Research and Innovation Future Leaders Fellowship (MR/T021780/1) and has received honoraria/consultancy fees from Atheneum, ParachuteBH and Nirakara, independent of this work.

Here, using 23 phenotypes and genotypes from two independent laboratories, we obtained a sample size of 3076 commercially available outbred mice and identified 70 loci, more than double the number of loci identified in the component studies. Fine-mapping in the combined sample reduced the number of likely causal variants, with a median reduction in set size of 51%, and indicated novel gene associations, including Pnpo, Ttll6, and GM11545 with bone mineral density, and Psmb9 with weight. However, replication at a nominal threshold of 0.05 between the two component studies was low, with less than one-third of loci identified in one study replicated in the second. In addition to overestimates in the effect size in the discovery sample (Winner's Curse), we also found that heterogeneity between studies explained the poor replication, but the contribution of these two factors varied among traits. Leveraging these observations, we integrated information about replication rates, study-specific heterogeneity, and Winner's Curse corrected estimates of power to assign variants to one of four confidence levels. Our approach addresses concerns about reproducibility and demonstrates how to obtain robust results from mapping complex traits in any genome-wide association study. (Â© The Author(s) 2021.

However, the cccDNA-interacting host factors that limit HBV replication remain elusive.; Methods: Minicircle HBV (MC-HBV), a recombinant cccDNA, was constructed based on chimeric intron and minicircle DNA technology. By mass spectrometry based on pull-down with biotinylated MC-HBV, the cccDNA-hepatocyte interaction profile was mapped. HBV replication was assessed in different cell models that support cccDNA formation.; Results: MC-HBV supports persistent HBV replication and mimics the cccDNA minichromosome. The MC-HBV-based screen identified cohesin complex as a cccDNA binding host factor, leading to reduced HBV replication. Mechanistically, with the help of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which has specific binding sites on cccDNA, cohesin loads on cccDNA and reshapes cccDNA confirmation to prevent RNA polymerase II enrichment. Interestingly, HBV X protein transcriptionally reduces structural maintenance of chromosomes complex expression to partially relieve the inhibitory role of the cohesin complex on HBV replication.; Conclusions: Our data not only provide a feasible approach to explore cccDNA-binding factors, but also identify cohesin/CTCF complex as a critical host restriction factor for cccDNA-driven HBV replication. These findings provide a novel insight into cccDNA-host interaction and targeted therapeutic intervention for HBV infection. (Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The motivation for the session was the recognition that progress in the extracellular vesicle (EV) field is limited by the availability of rigorous and reproducible EV measurement tools. These tools are absolutely required for EVs to evolve from a research lab curiosity to something that will improve our ability to understand, diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. The program focused on guidelines for EV measurement and characterization as laid out in the recent MISEV2018 and MIFlowCyt-EV publications, their implementation in routine practice, and their continued evolution as new EV measurement technologies are introduced. The conclusion of the workshop was that more effort focused on pre-analytical issues and benchmarking of isolation methods is needed to strengthen collaborations and advance more effective biomarkers.; Competing Interests: Conflict of interests JPN holds equity in Cellarcus Biosciences Inc.

The diagnosis is made based on reliable positive clinical signs, but clinicians often require additional time- and cost consuming medical tests and examinations. Resting-state functional connectivity (RS FC) showed its potential as an imaging-based adjunctive biomarker to help distinguish patients from healthy controls and could represent a "rule-in" procedure to assist in the diagnostic process. However, the use of RS FC depends on its applicability in a multi-centre setting, which is particularly susceptible to inter-scanner variability. The aim of this study was to test the robustness of a classification approach based on RS FC in a multi-centre setting.; Methods: This study aimed to distinguish 86 FND patients from 86 healthy controls acquired in four different centres using a multivariate machine learning approach based on whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity. First, previously published results were replicated in each centre individually (intra-centre cross-validation) and its robustness across inter-scanner variability was assessed by pooling all the data (pooled cross-validation). Second, we evaluated the generalizability of the method by using data from each centre once as a test set, and the data from the remaining centres as a training set (inter-centre cross-validation).; Results: FND patients were successfully distinguished from healthy controls in the replication step (accuracy of 74%) as well as in each individual additional centre (accuracies of 73%, 71% and 70%). The pooled cross validation confirmed that the classifier was robust with an accuracy of 72%. The results survived post-hoc adjustment for anxiety, depression, psychotropic medication intake, and symptom severity. The most discriminant features involved the angular- and supramarginal gyri, sensorimotor cortex, cingular- and insular cortex, and hippocampal regions. The inter-centre validation step did not exceed chance level (accuracy below 50%).; Conclusions: The results demonstrate the applicability of RS FC to correctly distinguish FND patients from healthy controls in different centres and its robustness against inter-scanner variability. In order to generalize its use across different centres and aim for clinical application, future studies should work towards optimization of acquisition parameters and include neurological and psychiatric control groups presenting with similar symptoms.

ACT-DL+TAU consisted of 8 ACT-sessions augmented with an EMI-app. The primary outcome was psychotic distress assessed with the Comprehensive Assessment scale of At Risk Mental State (CAARMS) at post-intervention and 6- and 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were functioning, symptom severity, and momentary psychotic distress. We performed multivariate mixed models according to intent-to-treat principles.; Results: Between June 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018, 668 participants were referred, of whom 148 were randomized to ACT-DL+TAU (n = 71) or TAU (n = 77). One hundred and fifteen (78%) provided primary outcome data at least at one follow-up assessment. There was no evidence of greater reduction in the primary outcome measure CAARMS distress in ACT-DL+TAU compared to TAU (Ï2(3) = 2.36; p = 0.50). However, out of the tested secondary outcomes, global functioning (Ï2(3) = 9.05; p = 0.033), and negative symptoms (Ï2(3) = 19.91; p&lt;0.001) improved in ACT-DL+TAU compared to TAU, as did momentary psychotic distress (Ï2(3) = 21.56; p &lt; 0.001).; Conclusions: INTERACT did not support a significant effect of ACT-DL over TAU on the primary outcome measure of psychotic distress as assessed with the CAARMS. Although significant improvements were found for some secondary outcome measures, further replication studies are needed to confirm the strength and specificity of these effects. (Â© 2022 S.

A finding is elevated from single observation to scientific evidence when the procedures that were used to obtain it can be reproduced and the finding itself can be replicated. Recent replication attempts show that some high profile results---most notably in psychology, but in many other disciplines as well---cannot be replicated consistently. These replication attempts have generated a considerable amount of controversy and the issue of whether direct replications have value has, in particular, proven to be contentious. However, much of this discussion has occurred in published commentaries and social media outlets, resulting in a fragmented discourse. To address the need for an integrative summary, we review various types of replication studies and then discuss the most commonly voiced concerns about direct replication. We provide detailed responses to these concerns and consider different statistical ways to evaluate replications. We conclude there are no theoretical or statistical obstacles to making direct replication a routine aspect of psychological science.

We evaluated whether a rule learning mechanism may serve to explain such generalisation. To this end, we assessed whether inference rules communicated through verbal instructions affect generalisation. Expectancy ratings, but not valence ratings, proved sensitive to this manipulation. In addition to revealing a role for inference rules in generalisation, our study has clinical implications as well. More specifically, we argue that targeting inference rules might prove to be an effective strategy to affect the excessive generalisation that is often observed in psychopathology.

These conclusions are based on an assessment of the replicability of four different network models for symptoms of major depression and generalized anxiety across two samples; in addition, Forbes et al. analyzed the stability of the network models within the samples using split-halves. Our reanalysis of the same data with the same methods led to results directly opposed to theirs: All network models replicated very well across the two data sets and across the split-halves. We trace the differences between Forbes et al.âs results and our own to the fact that they did not appear to accurately implement all network models and used debatable metrics to assess replicability. In particular, they deviated from existing estimation routines for relative importance networks, did not acknowledge the fact that the skip structure used in the interviews strongly distorted correlations between symptoms, and incorrectly assumed that network structures and metrics should be the same not only across the different samples but also across the different network models used. In addition to a comprehensive reanalysis of the data, we end with a discussion of best practices concerning future research into the replicability of psychometric networks.

In the commentary, there was an error in the References list. The publishing year for the 18th article was cited incorrectly as 2016. The in-text acronym associated with this citation should read instead as LCL2017. The correct References list citation should read as follows: LeBel, E. P., Campbell, L., &amp; Loving, T. J. (2017).

The online version of this article has been corrected.] Finkel, Eastwick, and Reis (2015; FER2015) argued that psychological science is better served by responding to apprehensions about replicability rates with contextualized solutions than with one-size-fits-all solutions. Here, we extend FER2015âs analysis to suggest that much of the discussion of best research practices since 2011 has focused on a single feature of high-quality scienceâreplicabilityâwith insufficient sensitivity to the implications of recommended practices for other features, like discovery, internal validity, external validity, construct validity, consequentiality, and cumulativeness. Thus, although recommendations for bolstering replicability have been innovative, compelling, and abundant, it is difficult to evaluate their impact on our science as a whole, especially because many research practices that are beneficial for some features of scientific quality are harmful for others. For example, FER2015 argued that bigger samples are generally better, but also noted that very large samples ('those larger than required for effect sizes to stabilize'; p. 291) could have the downside of commandeering resources that would have been better invested in other studies. In their critique of FER2015, LeBel, Campbell, and Loving (2016) concluded, based on simulated data, that ever-larger samples are better for the efficiency of scientific discovery (i.e., that there are no tradeoffs). As demonstrated here, however, this conclusion holds only when the replicatorâs resources are considered in isolation. If we widen the assumptions to include the original researcherâs resources as well, which is necessary if the goal is to consider resource investment for the field as a whole, the conclusion changes radicallyâand strongly supports a tradeoff-based analysis. In general, as psychologists seek to strengthen our science, we must complement our much-needed work on increasing replicability with careful attention to the other features of a high-quality science.

We sought to examine how variations in structural and functional brain networks relate to depressive symptoms in premanifest HD and healthy controls. Brain networks were constructed using diffusion tractography (70 preHD and 81 controls) and resting state fMRI (92 preHD and 94 controls) data. A sub-network associated with depression was identified in a data-driven fashion and network-based statistics was used to investigate which specific connections correlated with depression scores. A replication analysis was then performed using data from a separate study. Correlations between depressive symptoms with increased functional connectivity and decreased structural connectivity were seen for connections in the default mode network (DMN) and basal ganglia in preHD.

The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology was set up to provide evidence about the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology by repeating selected experiments from high-impact papers. A total of 50 experiments from 23 papers were repeated, generating data about the replicability of a total of 158 effects. Most of the original effects were positive effects (136), with the rest being null effects (22). A majority of the original effect sizes were reported as numerical values (117), with the rest being reported as representative images (41). We employed seven methods to assess replicability, and some of these methods were not suitable for all the effects in our sample. One method compared effect sizes: for positive effects, the median effect size in the replications was 85% smaller than the median effect size in the original experiments, and 92% of replication effect sizes were smaller than the original. The other methods were binary - the replication was either a success or a failure - and five of these methods could be used to assess both positive and null effects when effect sizes were reported as numerical values. For positive effects, 40% of replications (39/97) succeeded according to three or more of these five methods, and for null effects 80% of replications (12/15) were successful on this basis; combining positive and null effects, the success rate was 46% (51/112). A successful replication does not definitively confirm an original finding or its theoretical interpretation. Equally, a failure to replicate does not disconfirm a finding, but it does suggest that additional investigation is needed to establish its reliability.; Competing Interests: TE, AD Employed by the Center for Open Science, a non-profit organization that has a mission to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research, MM No competing interests declared, CS Was employed by the Center for Open Science, a non-profit organization that has a mission to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research, NP Was employed by and holds shares in Science Exchange Inc, EI Employed by and holds shares in Science Exchange Inc, BN Employed by the nonprofit Center for Open Science that has a mission to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research (Â© 2021, Errington et al.)</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=34874005&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fuess, Scott M., Jr.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On Replication in Business and Economics Research: The QJBE Case</title><secondary-title>Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics</full-title><abbr-1>Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3-13</pages><volume>35</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Sociology of Economics A14</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>07475535</isbn><abstract>In 1984 the Quarterly Journal of Business and Economic (QJBE) became the first journal to give priority to publishing econometric replications. This study is a retrospective on the research published in the QJBE under this policy. Over the 1984-94 period, replications occupied more than 21% of the journal's contents. Further, the acceptance rate for replications has been higher than for other studies. The journal also devoted more than 5% of its pages to reviews of empirical literature. Replication articles have focused on financial economics and industrial organization; they tended to use publicly available data sets and not to contradict entirely the findings of earlier studies. Econometric replications have been more heavily represented in the QJBE than in other outlets, but they have not dominated the contents of the journal. This finding suggests that editorial policy can bring forth a supply of replication research, but other active measures are necessary before such studies become more common.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=0383031&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cobos, Pedro L.</author><author>GutiÃ©rrez-Cobo, MarÃ­a J.</author><author>MorÃ­s, JoaquÃ­n</author><author>Luque, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dependent measure and time constraints modulate the competition between conflicting feature-based and rule-based generalization processes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition</abbr-1></periodical><pages>515-527</pages><volume>43</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Cognitive Generalization</keyword><keyword>Cognitive Processes</keyword><keyword>Cues</keyword><keyword>feature-based</keyword><keyword>generalization</keyword><keyword>Judgment</keyword><keyword>judgments</keyword><keyword>priming</keyword><keyword>Priming</keyword><keyword>rule-based</keyword><keyword>Stimulus Onset</keyword><keyword>Time</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0278-7393</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1037/xlm0000335</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In our study, we tested the hypothesis that feature-based and rule-based generalization involve different types of processes that may affect each other producing different results depending on time constraints and on how generalization is measured. For this purpose, participants in our experiments learned cueâoutcome relationships that followed the opposites rule: Single cues that signaled the same outcome (e.g., A-1/B-1) predicted the opposite outcome when presented in compound (e.g., AB-2). Some cues were only presented in compound during training (e.g., EF-1) to see if at test participants tended to generalize according to rule-based (i.e., E-2/F-2) or according to feature-based generalization (i.e., E-1/F-1). The generalization test used 2 different tasks: a predictive judgment task, and a cued-response priming task. In Experiment 1, participantsâ verbal ratings were consistent with rule-based generalization. However, participantsâ reaction times (RTs) in the cued-response priming task were consistent with feature-based generalization. Experiment 2 replicated the results from Experiment 1, and it also provided evidence consistent with feature-based or rule-based generalization depending on whether a short stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA; 200 ms) or a long SOA (1300 ms), respectively, was used in the priming task. Our results are interpreted as supporting the idea that feature-based generalization process relies on fast, associative processes, whereas rule-based generalization is slow and depends on executive control resources. The latter generalization process would inhibit the former when enough time and resources are available. Otherwise, feature-based generalization would take control of responses.

The IMIâC is based on the assumption that a target personâs interpersonal styles can validly be measured by assessing the internal (cognitive and emotional) reactions of the IMIâC respondent (e.g., therapists), interacting with the target person (e.g., psychotherapy patients). This replication study tested the circumplexity of a computer-delivered Dutch IMIâC. The computer-delivered Dutch IMIâC approached circumplexity in a large clinical sample (N = 812) of psychotherapy and psychiatric patients, after removing 3 items from the Submissive octant scale. These 3 items clearly disturbed the IMIâC circumplex structure. It is concluded that, even with the inevitable problem of nested data, circumplexity was approached sufficiently to justify the interpretation of the IMIâC at the octant level, provided that the 3 troublesome Submissive items are removed from the calculations of octant scores. Our replication test of the Dutch IMIâC circumplexity might be an impetus for researchers in the United States to invest in the further validation of the original American version.

Replication studies are critical for building a cumulative body of research knowledge. This article discusses and provides a typology of different types of replications, compares replications with other approaches to cumulating knowledge, and provides guidelines toward producing highâquality replication studies. The articles in this Special Issue provide examples of replication studies in strategic management. Managerial summary: Research studies sometimes draw implications for managerial practice. A single empirical study, however, is specific to a particular context, relies on a particular set of data, and uses a particular research design. As a consequence, a single study cannot establish whether the findings generalize to a different context and whether the research design is robust to alternative approaches. Replication studies can help to establish the range of applicability of prior studies and better support what implications can be drawn for managerial practice.

In this review, we examined the extent and nature of replication of intervention research in special education using an 'article progeny' approach and a three-pronged definition of replication (direct, conceptual, intervention overlap). In this approach, original articles (i.e., parent studies) were selected via a stratified, random sampling procedure. Next, we examined all articles that referenced the parent articles (i.e., child studies) to determine the extent and nature of the replication of the original studies. Seventy-five percent of the parent studies were replicated by at least one child study. Across all parent studies, there were 39 replication child studies. Although there was a high overall replication rate, there were a limited number of conceptual replications, and no direct replication studies were identified.

We conducted a review of replication rates in special education journals similar to the review conducted by Makel et al. in this issue. Unknowingly conducting independent reviews allowed for an unexpected opportunity to examine how two teams of researchers attempted to replicate a previously published study and explore similarities and differences between the outcomes. In our review, we identified 70 replication studies published between 1997 and 2013, indicating that 0.41% of published articles in special education journals are replication studies. Similar to findings reported by Makel et al., our review indicates that most replications are successful and that successful replications are more likely when author overlap occurs. Although there are similar patterns in the two data sets, an examination of exact agreement on article inclusion revealed an agreement rate of 15.2%. Possible explanations for the discrepancy and implications for future directions are provided.

The conditions contributing to irreproducibility in other disciplines are also present in ecology. These include a large discrepancy between the proportion of "positive" or "significant" results and the average statistical power of empirical research, incomplete reporting of sampling stopping rules and results, journal policies that discourage replication studies, and a prevailing publish-or-perish research culture that encourages questionable research practices. We argue that these conditions constitute sufficient reason to systematically evaluate the reproducibility of the evidence base in ecology and evolution. In some cases, the direct replication of ecological research is difficult because of strong temporal and spatial dependencies, so here, we propose metaresearch projects that will provide proxy measures of reproducibility.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28596617&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinothraj, S</author><author>Subramaniyan, A</author><author>Venkataramanan, R</author><author>Joseph, Cecilia</author><author>Sivaselvam, S N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic evaluation of reproduction performance of Jersey Ã Red Sindhi crossbred cows.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary world</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary world</full-title><abbr-1>Veterinary world</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1012-1017</pages><volume>9</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>genetic parameters</keyword><keyword>Jersey crossbred</keyword><keyword>reproductive performance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0972-8988</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.14202/vetworld.2016.1012-1017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aim: The present investigation was undertaken to study the reproduction performance and effect of non-genetic factors on reproduction performance of Jersey crossbred cows.; Materials and Methods: Data on 355 Jersey crossbred cattle maintained at the Post-graduate Research Institute in Animal Sciences, Kattupakkam, Tamil Nadu, distributed over 30 years (1985 to 2014). The effect of various non-genetic factors including the period of birth, season of birth, period of calving, season of calving and parity were analyzed through least-squares analyses using univariate general linear model. The different (co)variance components for calculation of genetic parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood method by fitting an animal model.; Results: The overall least-squares means (Â±standard error) of age at first service, age at first calving, weight at first calving, service period, calving interval, dry period, and number of services per conception were 848.06Â±9.72 days, 1204Â±12.20 days, 289.81Â±1.71 kg, 210.01Â±6.41 days, 489.12Â±6.45 days, 137.96Â±5.58 days, 2.50Â±0.07, respectively. Period of calving had either significant (p&lt;0.05) or highly significant (p&lt;0.01) effect on all reproduction traits studied except service period, calving interval, and dry period. Number of services per conception was affected by season of calving. Parity had significant influence (p&lt;0.05) or highly significant (p&lt;0.01) influence on all the traits studied except service period and dry period. Heritability estimates of age at first service, age at first calving, weight at first calving, service period, calving interval, dry period, and number of services per conception were 0.299, 0.220, 0.017, 0.142, 0.222, 0.177, and 0.042, respectively. The estimates of repeatability for service period, calving interval, dry period, and number of services per conception were 0.219, 0.234, 0.420, and 0.001, respectively.; Conclusions: The reproduction performances of Jersey Ã Red Sindhi crossbreds were lower when compared to the earlier reports on Jersey crossbreds. Heritability and repeatability values were also low to moderate, indicating limited scope for improvement through selection.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27733805&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bierhals, Christine Garcia</author><author>Howard, Alison</author><author>Hirst, Barry H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reduction of Rapid Proliferating Tumour Cell Lines by Inhibition of the Specific Glycine Transporter GLYT1.</title><secondary-title>Biomedicines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomedicines</full-title><abbr-1>Biomedicines</abbr-1></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>colorectal cancer</keyword><keyword>glycine metabolism</keyword><keyword>glycine transport</keyword><keyword>GLYT1</keyword><keyword>NSCLC</keyword><keyword>rapid proliferating tumour</keyword><keyword>tumour</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-11-25</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2227-9059</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/biomedicines9121770</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Studies have highlighted the relevance of extracellular glycine and serine in supporting high growth rates of rapidly proliferating tumours. The present study analysed the role of the specific glycine transporter GLYT1 in supplying glycine to cancer cells and maintaining cell proliferation. GLYT1 knockdown in the rapidly proliferating tumour cell lines A549 and HT29 reduced the number of viable cells by approximately 30% and the replication rate presented a decrease of about 50% when compared to cells transfected with control siRNA. In contrast, when compared to control, GLYT1 siRNA had only a minimal effect on cell number of the slowly proliferating tumour cell line A498, reducing the number of viable cells by 7% and no significant difference was observed when analysing the replication rate between GLYT1 knockdown and control group. When utilising a specific GLYT1 inhibitor, ALX-5407, the doubling time of rapidly proliferating cells increased by about 8 h presenting a significant reduction in the number of viable cells after 96 h treatment when compared to untreated cells. Therefore, these results suggest that GLYT1 is required to maintain high proliferation rates in rapidly proliferating cancer cells and encourage further investigation of GLYT1 as a possible target in a novel therapeutic approach.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=34944586&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sy, Karla Therese L</author><author>White, Laura F</author><author>Nichols, Brooke E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducible Science Is Vital for a Stronger Evidence Base During the COVID-19 Pandemic.</title><secondary-title>Geographical analysis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geographical analysis</full-title><abbr-1>Geographical analysis</abbr-1></periodical><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-11-16</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0016-7363</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gean.12314</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reproducible research becomes even more imperative as we build the evidence base on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. In his study, Paez assessed the reproducibility of COVID-19 research during the pandemic, using a case study of population density. He found that most articles that assess the relationship of population density and COVID-19 outcomes do not publicly share data and code, except for a few, including our paper, which he stated "illustrates the importance of good reproducibility practices". Paez recreated our analysis using our code and data from the perspective of spatial analysis, and his new model came to a different conclusion. The disparity between our and Paez's findings, as well as other existing literature on the topic, give greater impetus to the need for further research. As there has been near exponential growth of COVID-19 research across a wide range of scientific disciplines, reproducible science is a vital component to produce reliable, rigorous, and robust evidence on COVID-19, which will be essential to inform clinical practice and policy in order to effectively eliminate the pandemic.

It involves identifying a topic and selecting a cross-section of studies for replication. We apply the method to research on the psychological consequences of scarcity. Starting with the papers citing a seminal publication in the field, we conducted replications of 20 studies that evaluate the role of scarcity priming in pain sensitivity, resource allocation, materialism, and many other domains. There was considerable variability in the replicability, with some strong successes and other undeniable failures. Empirical audit and review does not attempt to assign an overall replication rate for a heterogeneous field, but rather facilitates researchers seeking to incorporate strength of evidence as they refine theories and plan new investigations in the research area. This method allows for an integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches to review and enables the growth of a cumulative science.; Competing Interests: The authors declare no competing interest.

To assess the role of chIL4 in velogenic NDV pathogenesis we created a vNDV infectious clone expressing chIL4. We hypothesized that co-expression of chIL4 during virus replication would result in decreased inflammation caused by the Th1 response and thereby increasing survival to challenge with vNDV.; Methods: To evaluate the effect of chIL4 during early infection with velogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in chickens, recombinant NDV clones expressing either chIL4 (rZJ1-IL4) or a control expressing green fluorescent protein (rZJ1-GFP) were created by inserting an expression cassette in an intergenic region of the NDV genome. The pathogenesis of rZJ1-IL4 was assessed in 4-week-old specific pathogen free chickens. The extent of virus replication was evaluated by titration in mucosal secretions and immunohistochemistry in multiple tissues. Expression of chIL4 was confirmed in tissues using immunohistochemistry.; Results: Infection of birds with the rZJ1-IL4 resulted in successful viral replication in vivo and in vitro and generation of the chIL4 in tissues. All birds were clinically normal 2 DPI, with one bird in each group showing conjunctival swelling and enlarged spleens grossly. At 5 DPI, moderate or severe depression was observed in birds infected with rZJ1-GFP or rZJ1-IL4, respectively. Neurological signs and thymic atrophy were observed in one bird infected with rZJ1-IL4. Grossly, conjunctival swelling, mottled spleen and proventricular hemorrhages were observed at 5 DPI in one bird from each group. At 5 DPI, severe necrosis in the spleen, bursa and cecal tonsils were observed in birds infected with rZJ1-GFP, along with minimal evidence of chIL4 expression. In contrast, splenic atrophy, and moderate necrosis in the bursa and cecal tonsils were observed in birds infected with rZJ1-IL4. In addition, chIL4 signal was found in all tissues of rZJ1-IL4 birds at 5DPI.; Conclusions: The production of chIL4 by a recombinant NDV strain resulted in the activation of the positive feedback loop associated with IL4 production. Insertion of chIL4 into NDV may decrease necrosis to lymphoid organs while increasing the severity of lymphoid atrophy and prolonged disease. However, with a low number of birds it is difficult to determine whether these results are significant to disease outcome. (Copyright Â© 2021.

Based on WHO estimates, a staggering 190 million people struggle with this health condition, and male factor is the sole or contributing factor in roughly 20-50% of these cases. Nowadays, urologists are confronted with a wide spectrum of conditions ranging from the typical infertile male to more complex cases of either unexplained or idiopathic male infertility, requiring a specific patient-tailored diagnostic approach and management. Strikingly enough, no identifiable cause in routine workup can be found in 30% to 50% of infertile males. The medical term male oxidative stress infertility (MOSI) was recently coined to describe infertile men with abnormal sperm parameters and oxidative stress (OS), including those previously classified as having idiopathic infertility. OS is a critical component of male infertility, entailing an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants. ROS abundance has been implicated in sperm abnormalities, while the exact impact on fertilization and pregnancy has long been a subject of considerable debate. In an attempt to counteract the deleterious effects of OS, urologists resorted to antioxidant supplementation. Mounting evidence indicates that indiscriminate consumption of antioxidants has led in some cases to sperm cell damage through a reductive-stress-induced state. The "antioxidant paradox", one of the biggest andrological challenges, remains a lurking danger that needs to be carefully avoided and thoroughly investigated. For that reason, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) emerged as a viable ancillary tool to basic semen analysis, measuring the overall balance between oxidants and antioxidants (reductants). A novel biomarker, the Male infertility Oxidative System (MiOXSYS Â® ), is a paradigm shift towards that goal, offering a quantification of OS via a quick, reliable, and reproducible measurement of the ORP. Moderation or " ÎÎ­ÏÏÎ¿Î½ " according to the ancient Greeks is the key to successfully safeguarding redox balance, with MiOXSYS Â® earnestly claiming its position as a guarantor of homeostasis in the intracellular redox milieu. In the present paper, we aim to offer a narrative summary of evidence relevant to redox regulation in male reproduction, analyze the impact of OS and reductive stress on sperm function, and shed light on the "antioxidant paradox" phenomenon. Finally, we examine the most up-to-date scientific literature regarding ORP and its measurement by the recently developed MiOXSYS Â® assay.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=34679669&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stepnov, Andrey</author><author>Chernykh, Vladimir</author><author>Konovalov, Alexey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Seismo-Performer: A Novel Machine Learning Approach for General and Efficient Seismic Phase Recognition from Local Earthquakes in Real Time.</title><secondary-title>Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)</abbr-1></periodical><volume>21</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>attention</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>CNN</keyword><keyword>computational efficiency</keyword><keyword>deep learning</keyword><keyword>Earthquakes*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>local seismic network</keyword><keyword>Machine Learning</keyword><keyword>Motion</keyword><keyword>real-time automation</keyword><keyword>seismic phase</keyword><keyword>seismogram</keyword><keyword>spectrogram</keyword><keyword>transformer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-09-19</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-8220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s21186290</electronic-resource-num><abstract>When recording seismic ground motion in multiple sites using independent recording stations one needs to recognize the presence of the same parts of seismic waves arriving at these stations. This problem is known in seismology as seismic phase picking. It is challenging to automate the accurate picking of seismic phases to the level of human capabilities. By solving this problem, it would be possible to automate routine processing in real time on any local network. A new machine learning approach was developed to classify seismic phases from local earthquakes. The resulting model is based on spectrograms and utilizes the transformer architecture with a self-attention mechanism and without any convolution blocks. The model is general for various local networks and has only 57 k learning parameters. To assess the generalization property, two new datasets were developed, containing local earthquake data collected from two different regions using a wide variety of seismic instruments. The data were not involved in the training process for any model to estimate the generalization property. The new model exhibits the best classification and computation performance results on its pre-trained weights compared with baseline models from related work. The model code is available online and is ready for day-to-day real-time processing on conventional seismic equipment without graphics processing units.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=34577497&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Killen, Shaun S</author><author>Christensen, Emil A F</author><author>Cortese, Daphne</author><author>ZÃ¡vorka, Libor</author><author>Norin, Tommy</author><author>Cotgrove, Lucy</author><author>Crespel, AmÃ©lie</author><author>Munson, Amelia</author><author>Nati, Julie J H</author><author>Papatheodoulou, Magdalene</author><author>McKenzie, David J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Guidelines for reporting methods to estimate metabolic rates by aquatic intermittent-flow respirometry.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of experimental biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of experimental biology</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of experimental biology</abbr-1></periodical><volume>224</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>Aerobic metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Basal Metabolism</keyword><keyword>Experimental design</keyword><keyword>Fish</keyword><keyword>Metabolic rate</keyword><keyword>Oxygen</keyword><keyword>Oxygen Consumption*</keyword><keyword>Oxygen*</keyword><keyword>Replication</keyword><keyword>Temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-09-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1477-9145</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jeb.242522</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Interest in the measurement of metabolic rates is growing rapidly, because of the importance of metabolism in advancing our understanding of organismal physiology, behaviour, evolution and responses to environmental change. The study of metabolism in aquatic animals is undergoing an especially pronounced expansion, with more researchers utilising intermittent-flow respirometry as a research tool than ever before. Aquatic respirometry measures the rate of oxygen uptake as a proxy for metabolic rate, and the intermittent-flow technique has numerous strengths for use with aquatic animals, allowing metabolic rate to be repeatedly estimated on individual animals over several hours or days and during exposure to various conditions or stimuli. There are, however, no published guidelines for the reporting of methodological details when using this method. Here, we provide the first guidelines for reporting intermittent-flow respirometry methods, in the form of a checklist of criteria that we consider to be the minimum required for the interpretation, evaluation and replication of experiments using intermittent-flow respirometry. Furthermore, using a survey of the existing literature, we show that there has been incomplete and inconsistent reporting of methods for intermittent-flow respirometry over the past few decades. Use of the provided checklist of required criteria by researchers when publishing their work should increase consistency of the reporting of methods for studies that use intermittent-flow respirometry. With the steep increase in studies using intermittent-flow respirometry, now is the ideal time to standardise reporting of methods, so that - in the future - data can be properly assessed by other scientists and conservationists.; Competing Interests: Competing interests The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

genetic variants affect complex phenotypes primarily via regulatory mechanisms on the transcriptome. To investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88% of genes, and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL (detected for 37% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested) showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication power and confounding by cell type composition. However, replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors. Expression of 13% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex phenotypes. (Â© 2021.

Research findings suggest that quarterly stock market returns are to some extent predictable but only marginal attention has been paid to possible nonlinearities in the return-generating process. The paper discusses input selection, elaborates on how to generate out-of-sample predictions to estimate generalization performance, motivates the choice for a particular network, examines backpropagation training, and evaluates network performance. The out-of-sample predictions are used to calculate several performance metrics and to determine added value when applying a straightforward tactical asset allocation policy. A nonparametric test is selected to evaluate generalization behavior and sensitivity analysis examines the selected network's qualitative behavior. Strong nonlinear effects appear to be absent, but the proposed backpropagation network generates an asset allocation policy that outperforms the linear model.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=0389575&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Rooden, Stephanie M.</author><author>Verbaan, Dagmar</author><author>Jeukens-Visser, Martine</author><author>van Hilten, Jacobus J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Studying reproducibility of data-driven Parkinson's disease subtypes</title><secondary-title>Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders</full-title><abbr-1>Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders</abbr-1></periodical><pages>251-252</pages><volume>62</volume><keywords><keyword>Biological Markers</keyword><keyword>Clinical subtypes</keyword><keyword>Data-driven</keyword><keyword>Delphi technique</keyword><keyword>Disease Progression</keyword><keyword>Heterogeneity</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Parkinson disease</keyword><keyword>Parkinson Disease</keyword><keyword>Parkinson's Disease</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Subtypes (Disorders)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1353-8020</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.parkreldis.2018.12.027</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Comments on an article by T. A. Mestre et al. (see record [rid]2018-65867-004[/rid]). The article by Mestre et al. dealt with Parkinson's disease (PD) subtypes. Assessing the reproducibility of data-driven subtypes is one approach to value the relevance of PD subtypes. Replication of previous studies on data-driven PD subtypes is necessary to perform further research based on these classifications. It is crucial that meaningful subtypes can be detected in other study populations than the original population and by other research groups. However, to determine whether studies can be replicated, it is essential that the methodology resembles the original methodology. Mestre et al. could not confirm the classification of our data-driven subtypes in the Dutch PROPARK cohort, which has been validated on the Spanish ELEP cohort. Based on the description in their publication, it appears that there are differences in the methodology, which may have prevented reproducibility of the original classification. In this replication study, autonomic symptoms were not included, whereas the patient characteristics gender, disease duration, age-at-onset, and disease severity were included. Another clustering technique was applied, namely K-means instead of model based clustering. The K-means method has certain drawbacks, and one of the risks is to end up in a local minimum, leading to a suboptimal solution. Therefore it is recommended to repeat the cluster analyses with a large number of starting points. Whether this was applied in the study of Mestre and colleagues is unclear.

Method: Caregivers of young children were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling. Participants were 395 caregivers of children (222 males, 173 females) aged from 1 month to 5 years and 11 months. Demographic items and the home section of the Young Children's Participation and Environment Measure were administered online, followed by completion of the daily activities, mobility, and social/cognitive domains of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test by telephone interview. Results: A structural equation model fitted the data well (comparative fit index = 0.91) and explained 31.2% of the variance in perceived environmental support and 42.5% of the variance in home involvement. Functional limitations and performance had an indirect effect on young children's participation through their effect on perceived environmental support. Specifically, fewer functional limitations and higher task performance were associated with greater environmental support, which in turn predicted higher levels of home involvement. Interpretation: Results suggest the importance of a young child's functional abilities and task performance on caregiver perceptions of environmental support at home, and the impact of environmental support on a child's participation in homeâbased activities during the early childhood period. Results warrant replication with more diverse samples to evaluate model generalizability.

However, a developing synergy between emerging analysis techniques and data-sharing initiatives has the potential to transform the role of neuroimaging in clinical applications. We review the state of translational neuroimaging and outline an approach to developing brain signatures that can be shared, tested in multiple contexts and applied in clinical settings. The approach rests on three pillars: (i) the use of multivariate pattern-recognition techniques to develop brain signatures for clinical outcomes and relevant mental processes; (ii) assessment and optimization of their diagnostic value; and (iii) a program of broad exploration followed by increasingly rigorous assessment of generalizability across samples, research contexts and populations. Increasingly sophisticated models based on these principles will help to overcome some of the obstacles on the road from basic neuroscience to better health and will ultimately serve both basic and applied goals.

Indeed, a distress response to benign stimuli that 'resemble' aspects of the trauma is a central feature of the disorder. To date, the link between overgeneralization of conditioned fear and PTSD derives largely from clinical observations, with limited empirical work on the subject. This represents the first effort to examine behavioral and brain indices of generalized conditioned fear in PTSD using systematic methods developed in animals known as generalization gradients: the gradual decline in conditioned responding as the presented stimulus gradually differentiates from CS+. Method: Gradients of conditioned fear generalization were assessed using functional MRI and behavioral measures in U.S. combat veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan and had PTSD (N = 26), subthreshold PTSD (N = 19), or no PTSD (referred to as trauma control subjects) (N = 17). Presented stimuli included rings of graded size, with extreme sizes serving as CS+ (paired with shock) and as a nonreinforced conditioned stimulus (CSâ, a conditioned safety cue), and with intermediate sizes forming a continuum of similarity between CS+ and CSâ. Generalization gradients were assessed as response slopes from CS+, through intermediate ring sizes, to CSâ, with less steep slopes indicative of stronger generalization. Results: Relative to trauma control subjects, PTSD patients showed stronger conditioned generalization, as evidenced by less steep generalization gradients in both behavioral risk ratings and brain responses in the left and right anterior insula, left ventral hippocampus, dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus. Severity of PTSD symptoms across the three study groups was positively correlated with levels of generalization at two such loci: the right anterior insula and left ventral hippocampus. Conclusions: The results point to evidence of brain-based markers of overgeneralized fear conditioning related to PTSD. These findings provide further understanding of a central yet understudied symptom of trauma-related psychopathology.

However, there is a paucity of studies that demonstrate such outcomes because many empirically-based behavioral parent training programs are typically assessed in controlled research settings, rather than in 'real world' settings where behavior change is intended. The limited body of literature that has reported investigations of the effects of parent skill generalization on child problem behavior in nontraining settings is examined here. Specifically, a quantitative analysis of generalization outcomes was conducted. In this analysis, amount of generalization found in nontraining settings was quantified by calculating a 'generalization score' for parent skills evaluated in each study. The formula used to compute a generalization score was 'percent change.' Generalization scores were calculated by dividing percent change scores for the nontraining setting by percent change scores for the training setting. Although generalization was not consistently shown across all parents, children, and/or variables in a number of studies, results suggest that parents can generalize skills to nontraining settings. However, knowledge of critical variables that produce generalization, techniques that reliably increase its likelihood, and individual variables that influence its occurrence, is incomplete. Recommendations for future research to increase parent skill generalization in real world settings are discussed.

Previous studies have examined the phenomenon of fear generalization among individuals with anxiety disorders and high trait anxiety. However, state anxiety is more common in populations and its impact on fear generalization has not been paid attention to. Thus, in this study, we induced state anxiety in healthy individuals and tested the impact of state anxiety on fear generalization. The results showed that exposure to the fear video significantly increased participants' state anxiety. The experimental group displayed stronger generalization than control group. Conditioned fear in the experimental group was generalized to rings with up to GSâ, GSâ, and GSâ in both skin conductance responses (SCR) and online expectancy ratings, whereas generalization in control group was restricted to rings with only GSâ in SCR or GSâ and GSâ in online expectancy ratings. The duration of generalization for the experimental group was longer than the control group in both SCR and online expectancy ratings, indicating that state anxiety slowed generalization extinction. Additionally, state anxiety enhanced the identification of conditioned stimuli in SCR.

At the end of 2020, a variant named 20I/501Y.V1 (lineage B.1.1.7) emerged and replaced other circulating strains in several regions. This phenomenon has been poorly associated with biological evidence that this variant and the original strain exhibit different phenotypic characteristics. Here, we analyze the replication ability of this new variant in different cellular models using for comparison an ancestral D614G European strain (lineage B1). Results from comparative replication kinetics experiments in vitro and in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium showed no difference. However, when both viruses were put in competition in human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, the 20I/501Y.V1 variant outcompeted the ancestral strain. All together, these findings demonstrate that this new variant replicates more efficiently and may contribute to a better understanding of the progressive replacement of circulating strains by the severe acute respiratory CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) 20I/501Y.V1 variant. IMPORTANCE The emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants raised numerous questions concerning the future course of the pandemic. We are currently observing a replacement of the circulating viruses by the variant from the United Kingdom known as 20I/501Y.V1, from the B.1.1.7 lineage, but there is little biological evidence that this new variant exhibits a different phenotype. In the present study, we used different cellular models to assess the replication ability of the 20I/501Y.V1 variant. Our results showed that this variant replicates more efficiently in human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, which may explain why it spreads so rapidly in human populations.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=34225487&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacEacheron, Melanie</author><author>Kohut, Taylor</author><author>Fisher, William A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>No Gender Differences in Enrollment for Replicated, Minimally-Different 'Pornographic' Versus 'Photographic' Studies.</title><secondary-title>International journal of sexual health : official journal of the World Association for Sexual Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of sexual health : official journal of the World Association for Sexual Health</full-title><abbr-1>International journal of sexual health : official journal of the World Association for Sexual Health</abbr-1></periodical><pages>130-143</pages><volume>34</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>minimal difference procedure</keyword><keyword>Pornography</keyword><keyword>self-selection into studies</keyword><keyword>survey research</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-08-27</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1931-762X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/19317611.2021.1944420</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: Since women tend to use pornography less, they may enroll less in studies concerning it and/or those who do may be gender-atypical.

In particular, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is frequently promoted as the gold standard in psychological sciences. However, the application of EFA to executive functioning, a core concept in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, has led to divergent conceptual models. This heterogeneity severely limits the generalizability and replicability of findings. To tackle this issue, in this study, we propose to capitalize on a machine learning approach, OPNMF (Orthonormal Projective Non-Negative Factorization), and leverage internal cross-validation to promote generalizability to an independent dataset. We examined its application on the scores of 334 adults at the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS), while comparing to standard EFA and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We further evaluated the replicability of the derived factorization across specific gender and age subsamples. Overall, OPNMF and PCA both converge towards a two-factor model as the best data-fit model. The derived factorization suggests a division between low-level and high-level executive functioning measures, a model further supported in subsamples. In contrast, EFA, highlighted a five-factor model which reflects the segregation of the D-KEFS battery into its main tasks while still clustering higher-level tasks together. However, this model was poorly supported in the subsamples. Thus, the parsimonious two-factors model revealed by OPNMF encompasses the more complex factorization yielded by EFA while enjoying higher generalizability.

It is unknown if this is an effective strategy.; Methods: Adult patients receiving a kidney and/or pancreas transplant were included if converted from PPX to PEM between 9/1/19 and 3/1/20 due to leukopenia. A positive CMV viral load (VL) was defined as CMV PCR greater than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) based on local lab testing. A CMV VL of &gt;500Â IU/mL was chosen as the preemptive treatment (PET) threshold. Primary objective was to describe the impact of conversion on resolution of leukopenia. Secondary objectives were to assess PEM associated outcomes.; Results: There were 49 patients converted from PPX to PEM due to leukopenia in the study period; 88% were KTRs and 96% received lymphocyte-depleting induction; 84% were seropositive at transplant (R+) and 16% were high-risk (D+/R-). Mean WBC at time of enrollment was 1.4Â Â±Â 0.4. After PEM conversion, WBC recovered to &gt;3 in 87.8% of the population in a mean of 26.8Â Â±Â 24.5Â days. Immunosuppression was modified in 96% of the population and GCSF was required in 46.9% of patients. CMV viremia occurred in 36.7% of the population; 78% were KTRs and 94% were R+. Time from PEM enrollment to PET was 64Â Â±Â 34Â days. Median VL at first detection was 587Â IU/mL, median peak was 1920Â IU/mL. Five patients (27.8%) presented with symptoms consistent with CMV syndrome, none had end organ disease. Six patients (33%) presented with a VL &lt;500Â IU/mL at first detection, but all subsequently surpassed the threshold and required PET. Mean duration of PET was 25Â Â±Â 11Â days. Mean change in WBC in response to PET was -0.4Â Â±Â 1.3. Immunosuppression required further adjustment in 61% of patients. There were no deaths or graft loss due to CMV at last follow-up.; Conclusion: In kidney and pancreas transplant recipients who undergo PEM conversion due to leukopenia, withholding of VGC can improve leukopenia, but other concomitant measures are necessary. This population should be considered fairly high risk, with a threshold of treatment of first quantifiable replication. Our findings suggest lack of harm from this approach but highlight the importance of close monitoring to prevent symptomatic replication. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to better evaluate the impact of PEM conversion on late-onset CMV and patient and graft outcomes.

It remains unclear if differences exist between these two threat-related emotions in conditioning and generalization. Evaluating different patterns of fear and disgust learning would facilitate a deeper understanding of how anxiety disorders develop. In this study, 32 college students completed threat conditioning tasks, including conditioned stimuli paired with frightening or disgusting images. Fear and disgust were divided into two randomly ordered blocks to examine differences by recording subjective US expectancy ratings and eye movements in the conditioning and generalization process. During conditioning, differing US expectancy ratings (fear vs. disgust) were found only on CS-, which may demonstrated that fear is associated with inferior discrimination learning. During the generalization test, participants exhibited greater US expectancy ratings to fear-related GS1 (generalized stimulus) and GS2 relative to disgust GS1 and GS2. Fear led to longer reaction times than disgust in both phases, and the pupil size and fixation duration for fear stimuli were larger than for disgust stimuli, suggesting that disgust generalization has a steeper gradient than fear generalization. These findings provide preliminary evidence for differences between fear- and disgust-related stimuli in conditioning and generalization, and suggest insights into treatment for anxiety and other fear- or disgust-related disorders.

This study sought to profile and identify determinants of scores from a reflection spectroscopy device (the Veggie Meter (VM) Â® ) among 297 urban, primarily Hispanic low-income adults served by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The repeatability of the scores and bi- and multivariate relationships between VM scores, self-reported FV intake measured by a brief screener, and participant characteristics were examined. The mean VM score was 270 (range 0-695); 3- and 6-month test-retest correlations were positive and strong (r = 0.79 and 0.55, respectively). VM scores were negatively associated with body mass index (BMI; r = -0.22) and were higher among participants of Ecuadorian, Dominican, and Mexican Hispanic origin relative to those of Puerto Rican origin; foreign- vs. US-born participants, breastfeeding vs. non-breastfeeding participants, nonsmokers vs. smokers, and participants who consumed three or more cups of FV/day relative to those who consumed less than three cups of FV/day. Foreign-born nativity, consumption of three or more cups of FV/day, and smaller body size were determinants of increased VM scores. Although replication studies are needed to confirm these findings, investigators working with similar populations are encouraged to use the VM to longitudinally track FV intake and to target determinants of the scores in observational and intervention studies of FV intake as measured by the VM.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=34209048&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mayer, Andrew R</author><author>Ling, Josef M</author><author>Dodd, Andrew B</author><author>Rannou-Latella, Julie G</author><author>Stephenson, David D</author><author>Dodd, Rebecca J</author><author>Mehos, Carissa J</author><author>Patton, Declan A</author><author>Cullen, D Kacy</author><author>Johnson, Victoria E</author><author>Pabbathi Reddy, Sharvani</author><author>Robertson-Benta, Cidney R</author><author>Gigliotti, Andrew P</author><author>Meier, Timothy B</author><author>Vermillion, Meghan S</author><author>Smith, Douglas H</author><author>Kinsler, Rachel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility and Characterization of Head Kinematics During a Large Animal Acceleration Model of Traumatic Brain Injury.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in neurology</full-title><abbr-1>Frontiers in neurology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>658461</pages><volume>12</volume><keywords><keyword>diffuse axonal injuries</keyword><keyword>dynamic acceleration</keyword><keyword>head kinematics</keyword><keyword>large animal model</keyword><keyword>sensors</keyword><keyword>traumatic brain injury</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-06-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1664-2295</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fneur.2021.658461</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Acceleration parameters have been utilized for the last six decades to investigate pathology in both human and animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI), design safety equipment, and develop injury thresholds. Previous large animal models have quantified acceleration from impulsive loading forces (i.e., machine/object kinematics) rather than directly measuring head kinematics. No study has evaluated the reproducibility of head kinematics in large animal models. Nine (five males) sexually mature Yucatan swine were exposed to head rotation at a targeted peak angular velocity of 250 rad/s in the coronal plane. The results indicated that the measured peak angular velocity of the skull was 51% of the impulsive load, was experienced over 91% longer duration, and was multi- rather than uni-planar. These findings were replicated in a second experiment with a smaller cohort ( N = 4). The reproducibility of skull kinematics data was mostly within acceptable ranges based on published industry standards, although the coefficients of variation (8.9% for peak angular velocity or 12.3% for duration) were higher than the impulsive loading parameters produced by the machine (1.1 vs. 2.5%, respectively). Immunohistochemical markers of diffuse axonal injury and blood-brain barrier breach were not associated with variation in either skull or machine kinematics, suggesting that the observed levels of variance in skull kinematics may not be biologically meaningful with the current sample sizes. The findings highlight the reproducibility of a large animal acceleration model of TBI and the importance of direct measurements of skull kinematics to determine the magnitude of angular velocity, refine injury criteria, and determine critical thresholds.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

The Reproducibility Project is an open, large-scale, collaborative effort to systematically examine the rate and predictors of reproducibility in psychological science. So far, 72 volunteer researchers from 41 institutions have organized to openly and transparently replicate studies published in three prominent psychological journals in 2008. Multiple methods will be used to evaluate the findings, calculate an empirical rate of replication, and investigate factors that predict reproducibility.

A subset of words containing each of 3 target vowel teams (aw, oi, and au) was trained in lists, and generalization was assessed to untrained words in lists, trained and untrained words in target passages, and novel words in generalization passages. A multiple probe design across vowel teams revealed generalized increases in oral reading accuracy for target words presented in both lists and passages for all 3 students on 2 vowel teams and for 1 student on all 3 vowel teams. Generalized increases in oral reading fluency in both lists and passages were found for all 3 students on the vowel team that was trained to a fluency criterion, with two students showing increases prior to training on the other two vowel teams.

With aphasia therapy aiming to promote change in everyday communication, there is a temptation to 'fish' for any evidence of improvement; multiple tasks, elicitation methods, and measures may be used to identify any change that might then be attributed to therapy. Examining the evidence about generalisation will allow us to develop our theoretical understanding of change following aphasia intervention and strengthen our ability to form robust predictions for generalisation that can be tested. Aims: We explore what is meant by generalisation, considering it within the broader context of impact of intervention. We propose a framework focusing on linguistic generalisation at the levels of word, sentence, and connected speech. The discussion draws on the therapy literature for spoken production, exploring single-word therapies for nouns and verbs, sentence production therapies, and discourse therapies. Main Contribution: This article introduces a framework to conceptualise and describe generalisation within level, i.e., change to untreated stimuli within the same linguistic level as the focus of treatment, and across level, i.e., change at a different linguistic level to the focus of treatment. The existing evidence base for spoken production is reviewed using the framework, considering our current knowledge, the predictions we are able to make, and areas for future focus. Conclusions: There is an urgent need for further research in this area. While within-level generalisation has often been addressed systematically, there have been more limited attempts to systematically define, predict, and measure generalisation across linguistic levels. This has resulted in a limited evidence base from which to make decisions regarding when and how to best facilitate generalisation and where and how to best measure generalisation. We propose it is time to stop fishing for change in an opportunistic way and to develop a greater understanding of the relationship between change at the different linguistic levels of words, sentences, and connected speech. We need to use theory and evidence to predict change (selecting the right 'pond' within which to fish) and identify valid and reliable ways to measure both targeted and generalised therapy effects (selecting the right 'bait').

The present study examines the extent to which replications are conducted in criminology. We conduct a content analysis of the five most influential journals in criminology. We also compare the replication rate in criminology with that in the social sciences and natural sciences. The results show that replication research is rarely published in these disciplines. In criminology journals in particular, replication studies constitute just over 2 percent of the articles published between 2006 and 2010. Further, those replication studies that were published in criminology journals in that period tended to conflict with the original studies. These findings call into question the utility of empirical results published in criminology journals for developing theory and policy. Strategies for promoting replication research in criminology are suggested.

This can be time consuming when there are large numbers of items on the test. In this study, a G-theory framework was used to determine if a subset of items can be used to make generalizable cut-score recommendations. Angoff ratings (i.e., probability judgments) from previously conducted standard setting studies were used first in a re-sampling study, followed by D-studies. For the re-sampling study, proportionally stratified subsets of items were extracted under various sampling and test-length conditions. The mean cut score, variance components, expected standard error (SE) around the mean cut score, and root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) across 1,000 replications were estimated at each study condition. The SE and the RMSD decreased as the number of items increased, but this reduction tapered off after approximately 45 items. Subsequently, D-studies were performed on the same datasets. The expected SE was computed at various test lengths. Results from both studies are consistent with previous research indicating that between 40â50 items are sufficient to make generalizable cut score recommendations.

To study this process, artist and nonartist raters assessed in-progress states of high- and low-quality emerging artworks. States were presented sequentially, as a methodological variant to previous research using random order presentation. Results for nonartists replicated earlier findings of a reliably shallower slope for the quality trajectories of high-quality drawings, as defined by artists. Results for artists were more complex; ratings of artists with different aesthetic judgment criteria were examined separately. Artists not valuing abstraction showed mostly similar results as nonartist raters. Inconsistent with earlier findings, abstraction-valuing showed no difference in high- versus low-quality drawings' trajectory slopes. Analyses of time-quality correlations for individual raters suggest abstraction-valuing artists gave lower ratings to later stages of low-quality drawings, producing null effects for slope. This implies that although sequential presentation may be more ecologically valid, random presentation yields results which allow better inferences as to the differences in the creative process.

To contribute data about replicability in economics, we replicated 18 studies published in the American Economic Review and the Quarterly Journal of Economics between 2011 and 2014. All of these replications followed predefined analysis plans that were made publicly available beforehand, and they all have a statistical power of at least 90% to detect the original effect size at the 5% significance level. We found a significant effect in the same direction as in the original study for 11 replications (61%); on average, the replicated effect size is 66% of the original. The replicability rate varies between 67% and 78% for four additional replicability indicators, including a prediction market measure of peer beliefs.

Here, we apply a novel statistical algorithm called Covariate-Modulated Mixture Modeling (CM3), which incorporates auxiliary information (heterozygosity, total linkage disequilibrium, genomic annotations, pleiotropy) for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to enable more accurate estimation of replication probabilities, conditional on the observed test statistic ("z-score") of the SNP. We use a multiple logistic regression on z-scores to combine information from auxiliary information to derive a "relative enrichment score" for each SNP. For each stratum of these relative enrichment scores, we obtain nonparametric estimates of posterior expected test statistics and replication probabilities as a function of discovery z-scores, using a resampling-based approach that repeatedly and randomly partitions meta-analysis sub-studies into training and replication samples. We fit a scale mixture of two Gaussians model to each stratum, obtaining parameter estimates that minimize the sum of squared differences of the scale-mixture model with the stratified nonparametric estimates. We apply this approach to the recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of SCZ (n = 82,315), obtaining a good fit between the model-based and observed effect sizes and replication probabilities. We observed that SNPs with low enrichment scores replicate with a lower probability than SNPs with high enrichment scores even when both they are genome-wide significant (p &lt; 5x10-8). There were 693 and 219 independent loci with model-based replication rates â¥80% and â¥90%, respectively. Compared to analyses not incorporating relative enrichment scores, CM3 increased out-of-sample yield for SNPs that replicate at a given rate. This demonstrates that replication probabilities can be more accurately estimated using prior enrichment information with CM3.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26808560&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vacha-Haase, Tammi</author><author>Thompson, Bruce</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Score reliability: A retrospective look back at 12 years of reliability generalization studies</title><secondary-title>Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development</full-title><abbr-1>Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development</abbr-1></periodical><pages>159-168</pages><volume>44</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>data analysis</keyword><keyword>generalization studies</keyword><keyword>psychometrics</keyword><keyword>Psychometrics</keyword><keyword>Statistical Analysis</keyword><keyword>test reliability</keyword><keyword>Test Reliability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0748-1756</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0748175611409845</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The present study was conducted to characterize (a) the features of the thousands of primary reports synthesized in 47 reliability generalization (RG) measurement meta-analysis studies and (b) typical methodological practice within the RG literature to date.

The 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is widely used but inconsistently and incompletely characterized throughout the literature. This hinders comparisons between studies and influences the low rate of translation of effective preclinical molecules. The purpose of this study was to categorize TNBS-induced colitis, based on macroscopic and microscopic scoring systems, and to identify basic routine parameters that could anticipate those categories. We retrospectively analysed male Wistar Rattus norvegicus (n=28 for the control group and n=87 for the TNBS group) and categorized TNBS-induced colitis in three phenotypes: Mild, Moderate and Severe colitis, as for human IBD. Also, we showed that the time course of food intake and fecal excretion (but not body weight, fluid intake or welfare scores) could foresee those categories. So, routine evaluation of food intake and fecal excretion may guide researchers in planning their experiments, selecting the animals with the severity of colitis that better matches their aims, or applying early humane endpoints to animals that will not be used in the experiments. In conclusion, categorizing TNBS-induced colitis enhances the reproducibility of data gathered with this experimental model and strengths its translational relevance.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=33536378&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hernandez-Pacheco, Natalia</author><author>Vijverberg, Susanne J</author><author>Herrera-Luis, Esther</author><author>Li, Jiang</author><author>Sio, Yang Yie</author><author>Granell, Raquel</author><author>Corrales, Almudena</author><author>Maroteau, Cyrielle</author><author>Lethem, Ryan</author><author>Perez-Garcia, Javier</author><author>Farzan, Niloufar</author><author>Repnik, Katja</author><author>Gorenjak, Mario</author><author>Soares, Patricia</author><author>Karimi, Leila</author><author>Schieck, Maximilian</author><author>PÃ©rez-MÃ©ndez, Lina</author><author>Berce, Vojko</author><author>Tavendale, Roger</author><author>Eng, Celeste</author><author>Sardon, Olaia</author><author>Kull, Inger</author><author>Mukhopadhyay, Somnath</author><author>Pirmohamed, Munir</author><author>Verhamme, Katia M C</author><author>Burchard, Esteban G</author><author>Kabesch, Michael</author><author>Hawcutt, Daniel B</author><author>MelÃ©n, Erik</author><author>PotoÄnik, UroÅ¡</author><author>Chew, Fook Tim</author><author>Tantisira, Kelan G</author><author>Turner, Steve</author><author>Palmer, Colin N</author><author>Flores, Carlos</author><author>Pino-Yanes, Maria</author><author>Maitland-van der Zee, Anke H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide association study of asthma exacerbations despite inhaled corticosteroid use.</title><secondary-title>The European respiratory journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The European respiratory journal</full-title><abbr-1>The European respiratory journal</abbr-1></periodical><volume>57</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Administration, Inhalation</keyword><keyword>Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Anti-Asthmatic Agents*/therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Asthma*/drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-05-13</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1399-3003</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1183/13993003.03388-2020</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Rationale: Substantial variability in response to asthma treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has been described among individuals and populations, suggesting the contribution of genetic factors. Nonetheless, only a few genes have been identified to date. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with asthma exacerbations despite ICS use in European children and young adults and to validate the findings in non-Europeans. Moreover, we explored whether a gene-set enrichment analysis could suggest potential novel asthma therapies.; Methods: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of asthma exacerbations was tested in 2681 children of European descent treated with ICS from eight studies. Suggestive association signals were followed up for replication in 538 European asthma patients. Further evaluation was performed in 1773 non-Europeans. Variants revealed by published GWAS were assessed for replication. Additionally, gene-set enrichment analysis focused on drugs was performed.; Results: 10 independent variants were associated with asthma exacerbations despite ICS treatment in the discovery phase (pâ¤5Ã10 -6 ). Of those, one variant at the CACNA2D3-WNT5A locus was nominally replicated in Europeans (rs67026078; p=0.010), but this was not validated in non-European populations. Five other genes associated with ICS response in previous studies were replicated. Additionally, an enrichment of associations in genes regulated by trichostatin A treatment was found.; Conclusions: The intergenic region of CACNA2D3 and WNT5A was revealed as a novel locus for asthma exacerbations despite ICS treatment in European populations. Genes associated were related to trichostatin A, suggesting that this drug could regulate the molecular mechanisms involved in treatment response.; Competing Interests: Conflict of interest: N.

Studies aimed at defining the proper rearing density have been performed with regard to behavioural and physiological stress response, sex ratio and reproduction. Studies concerning the effect of rearing density on the skeletal phenotype are lacking. This study analyses the response of the skeleton to different rearing densities and describes the skeletal deformities. Wild-type zebrafish were reared up to 30 dpf (days post-fertilization) in a common environment. From 30 to 90 dpf, animals were reared at three different densities: high density (HD), 32 fish l -1 ; medium density (MD), 8 fish l -1 and low density (LD), 2 fish l -1 . Animals at 30 and 90 dpf were collected and whole-mount stained with Alizarin red S to visualize mineralized tissues. The entire skeleton was analysed for meristic counts and 172 types of deformities. The results showed that the rearing density significantly influenced the specimens' average standard length, which decreased with the increase in the rearing density. Differences in meristic counts among the three groups were not observed. Rearing density-independent malformations affected the ribs, neural arches and the spines of the abdominal region, as well as vertebrae of the caudal complex. The HD group showed the highest number of deformities per specimen, the highest number of observed types of deformities and, together with the MD group, the highest frequency of specimens affected by severe deformities. In particular, the HD group showed deformities affecting arches, spines and vertebral centra in the caudal region of the vertebral column. This study provides evidence of an effect of the rearing density on the development of different skeletal phenotypes.

Reproduction results were compared to original results, focusing on cost-effectiveness outcomes, and the resulting reproduction success was assessed by published criteria. Replication facilitators and hurdles were identified and transferred into related reporting standards.; Results: All four case studies were state-transition models simulating costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Comparing original versus reproduction outcomes, the following deviation ranges were observed: costs -Â 3.9 to 16.1% (mean over all model simulations 3.78%), QALYs -Â 3.7 to 2.1% (mean -Â 0.11%), and average cost-utility ratios -Â 3.0 to 17.9% (mean 4.28%). Applying different published criteria, an overall reproduction success was observed for three of four models. Key replication facilitators were input data tables and model diagrams, while missing standard deviations and missing formulas for equations were considered as key hurdles.; Conclusions: This study confirms the feasibility of rebuilding health economic obesity models, but minor to major assumptions were needed to fill reporting gaps. Model replications can help to assess the quality of health economic model documentation and can be used to validate current model reporting practices.

The objective of this study was to assess the completeness of reporting for systematic reviews assessing the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) checklist that was published in 2018.; Design and Setting: In this meta-research study, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched, with no date restriction, on March 1st, 2020 for systematic reviews assessing the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS. Adherence to PRISMA-DTA for the main text and abstract was scored independently and in duplicate using a modified checklist. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed.; Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was the mean PRISMA-DTA checklist adherence for the full-text and abstract.; Results: A total of 71 studies published from 2008 to 2020 met the inclusion criteria. The overall adherence for the full-text was moderate: 19.8 out of 26.0 items (76%) and for the abstract was 7.0 out of 11.0 items (64%). Although many items in the PRISMA-DTA checklist were frequently reported, several were r infrequently reported (&lt;33% of studies), including item 5 (protocol registration), item D2 (minimally acceptable test accuracy) and item 14 (variability in target condition, index test and reference standards). Subgroup analyses showed a higher PRISMA-DTA mean adherence (SD) for high impact journals (20.9 (2.52) vs 18.9 (1.95); p&lt;0.001), studies including supplemental materials (20.6 (2.48) vs 18.9 (2.28); p=0.004), studies citing adherence to PRISMA reporting guidelines (20.4 (1.95) vs 19.0 (3.00); p=0.038) and studies published in journals endorsing PRISMA guidelines (20.2 (2.47) vs 18.6 (2.37); p=0.025). There was variable adherence based on journal of publication (p=0.006), but not for study population (adult vs paediatric vs mixed) (p=0.62), year of publication (p=0.94), body region (p=0.78) or country (p=0.40). There was no variability in abstract adherence based on whether the abstract was structured with subheadings or not (p=0.25). A Spearman's correlation found moderate correlation between higher word counts and abstractand full-text adherence (R=0.45, p&lt;0.001 and R=0.38, p=0.001), respectively.; Conclusions: Overall, the reporting of POCUS diagnostic accuracy systematic reviews and meta-analyses was moderate. We identified deficits in several key areas including the preregistration of systematic reviews in an online repository, handling of multiple definitions of target conditions, index tests and reference standards and specifying minimally acceptable test accuracy. Prospective registration of reviews and detailed reporting as per PRISMA-DTA during the research process could improve reporting completeness. At an editorial level, word count and supplemental material limitations may impede reporting completeness, whereas endorsement of reporting guidelines on journal websites could improve reporting.; Competing Interests: Competing interests: DJK is on the medical advisory board for the ultrasound company Clarius Mobile Health, however, has no relevant financial or other competing interests with respect to this study.

Similar to classical Batesian and MÃ¼llerian mimicry related to distastefulness, such 'evasive aposematism' may also lead to convergence in warning colours, known as evasive mimicry. A prime candidate group for evasive mimicry are Adelpha butterflies, which are agile insects and show remarkable colour pattern convergence. We tested the ability of naive blue tits to learn to avoid and generalize Adelpha wing patterns associated with the difficulty of capture and compared their response to that of birds that learned to associate the same wing patterns with distastefulness. Birds learned to avoid all wing patterns tested and generalized their aversion to other prey to some extent, but learning was faster with evasive prey compared to distasteful prey. Our results on generalization agree with longstanding observations of striking convergence in wing colour patterns among Adelpha species, since, in our experiments, perfect mimics of evasive and distasteful models were always protected during generalization and suffered the lowest attack rate. Moreover, generalization on evasive prey was broader compared to that on distasteful prey. Our results suggest that being hard to catch may deter predators at least as effectively as distastefulness. This study provides empirical evidence for evasive mimicry, a potentially widespread but poorly understood form of morphological convergence driven by predator selection.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=33715434&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hussein, Mohammad</author><author>Toraih, Eman</author><author>Elshazli, Rami</author><author>Fawzy, Manal</author><author>Houghton, August</author><author>Tatum, Danielle</author><author>Killackey, Mary</author><author>Kandil, Emad</author><author>Duchesne, Juan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meta-analysis on Serial Intervals and Reproductive Rates for SARS-CoV-2.</title><secondary-title>Annals of surgery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of surgery</full-title><abbr-1>Annals of surgery</abbr-1></periodical><pages>416-423</pages><volume>273</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Basic Reproduction Number</keyword><keyword>COVID-19/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>COVID-19/*transmission</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2/*pathogenicity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-03-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1528-1140</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/SLA.0000000000004400</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze all literature reporting the basic reproductive number (R0), effective reproductive number (Re or Rt), and the serial interval (SI) values of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.; Summary Background Data: To assess the rate at which an infectious disease can spread in a population, the 2 measures, R0 and Re or Rt, are widely used. One of the parameters which influence the calculations is the SI, the period between symptom onset in an infector and an infectee.; Methods: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct searching up to May 10, 2020, was performed. A continuous random-effect model was applied using the DerSimonian-Laird (inverse variance) method. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed.; Results: A total of 39 articles met the eligibility criteria. Our results demonstrated the mean SI was 5.45 days, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4.23 to 6.66. Pooled estimates for reproduction rates was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.69-3.59) for R0 and 3.18 (95% CI: 2.89-3.47) for Rt. Subgroup analysis by geographical region and date of publication revealed variations over both time and geography in calculated R0 and Rt values. As time has progressed, predicted R0 and Rt values had decreased globally.; Conclusions: The study findings indicate that one SARS-CoV-2-infected person is likely to infect 3 persons, supporting that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease. As an essential objective metrics implied in risk assessment for this emerging pandemic, monitoring R0 and Re is necessary to indicate the effectiveness or failures of mitigation efforts.; Competing Interests: The authors report no conflicts of interests.

DBR is a behavioral assessment tool with specific instrumentation and procedures that can be used by a variety of service delivery providers (e.g., teacher, teacher aide, parent, etc.) to collect time-series data on student behavior. The purpose of this study was to extend the findings presented by Chafouleas et al. with an examination of DBR outcomes as they are generalized across raters and rating occasions. One hundred twenty-five undergraduates viewed and rated student behavior on video clips while the children engaged in an unsolvable Lego puzzle task. A series of decision studies were used to evaluate the effects of alternate assessment conditions (variable numbers of raters and rating occasions) and interpretive assumptions (definitions of the universe of generalization). Results support the general conclusion that ratings from individual or small groups of simultaneous raters, when generalized only to that specific individual or group of individuals, can approach reliability criteria for low- and high-stakes decisions. Implications are discussed.

Between-group differences were converted to effect sizes for each study and compared to assess replication. Mothers of children with cancer reported significantly more anxiety, less family conflict, and more social support than controls. Fathers did not differ between groups. Effect sizes were small for most comparisons of parental distress, family environment, and social support. Social support had little effect on distress. Despite the 10-year gap between studies, agreement on group differences was high, especially when evaluating effect sizes (94%) in addition to significance testing (67%). Parents of children with cancer exhibited significant resilience during treatment. Direct study replication and effect size comparisons may have some advantages when used in conjunction with significance testing. Future replications and meta-analytic work may be helpful in this area.

C. Hulette and colleagues (in press; see also A. Cholankeril et al., 2007). The factors represent dissociation and posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. The present study also examined the extent to which these 2 factor scores varied depending on specific maltreatment experiences. Results indicated that children who experienced both physical and sexual abuse in addition to neglect had significantly higher levels of dissociation than children who experienced (a) sexual abuse alone or with neglect, (b) physical abuse alone or with neglect, or (c) only neglect. The current study provides evidence that children who experience multiple forms of maltreatment are more likely to be dissociative, perhaps due to a greater need for a coping mechanism to manage the distress of that maltreatment.

Despite their wide use, little basic research has explored canine olfactory generalization and discrimination. In the present study, we assessed canine odor discrimination amongst a series of chemically-related aliphatic alcohols. Domestic dogs were trained to discriminate 1-pentanol from air in a two-choice operant discrimination procedure until reaching an 85% accuracy criterion. In a series of transfer tasks, we assessed dogsâ generalization and discrimination between related odorants by replacing the Sâ stimulus with an alcohol related to pentanol, differing only in the length of the carbon chain. Dogs showed an increase in discrimination performance with an increase in the difference in the number of carbon atoms between pentanol and the comparison alcohol (p &lt;0.001). These results indicate that this graded series of alcohols may be a useful stimulus set for studying olfactory generalization and discrimination processes in dogs, and that dogs show the same relationship between chemical similarity and discrimination performance as has been observed with humans, monkeys, honeybees, elephants, and rats.

The authors of the review, however, noted considerable differences across the rubrics when addressing the generalization of findings. One critical finding is that the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) review process does not capture details needed for report readers to evaluate generalization. This conclusion is reasonable if considering only the WWCâs SCD design standards. It is important to note that these standards are not used in isolation, and thus generalization details cannot be fully understood without also considering the review protocols and a tool called the WWC SCD review guide. Our purpose in this commentary is to clarify how the WWC review procedures gather information on generalization criteria and to describe a threshold for judging how much evidence is available. It is important to clarify how the system works so that the SCD research community understands the standards, which in turn might facilitate use of future WWC reports and possibly influence both the conduct and the reporting of SCD studies.

This approach comprises formal tests of measurement invariance applied to the flexible ESEM framework and overcomes the limitations of congruence measures that have traditionally been used to assess factor replicability in personality research. On the basis of 1566 responses to the widely-used NEO Five-Factor-Inventory (NEO-FFI), we demonstrate this ESEM approach in the context of examining the invariance of the NEO-FFI factor structure across gender. The approach is shown to converge with traditional congruence measures and extend these measures for examining factorial structure consistency. In addition, more general replicative data supporting the validity of the NEO-FFI are reported. We discuss the ESEM approach as a viable alternative to the congruence approach and acknowledge some important limitations of the method.

Although both have extensive research support, no study to date has compared these methods with children who have autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Utilizing an adaptive alternating treatments design, the present study compared TDP and IR with a second-grade student, educated in a substantially separate classroom, who was diagnosed with ASD (N = 1). Retention, maintenance, and generalization results suggested that both methods were effective interventions for enhancing sight-word recognition. However, TDP was more effective and efficient than IR across retention, maintenance, and generalization measures. Limitations and implications of the study for school-based professionals are discussed.

Most current studies on reproduction-related genes have been conducted on cultured shrimp. However, gene expression is intimately linked to physiological and environmental conditions, and therefore an organism's growth environment has a great influence on reproduction. Thus, gene expression profiling, should be applied in fisheries studies. Here, we identified the expression patterns of 76 reproduction-related genes in P. vannamei via the analysis of pooled transcriptomes from a time-series experiment encompassing a full circadian cycle. The expression patterns of genes associated both directly ( Vtg , ODP , and ProR ) and indirectly ( FAMet , CruA1 , and CruC1 ) with reproduction were evaluated, as these genes could be used as molecular markers of previtellogenic and vitellogenic maturation stages. The evaluated genes were prominently upregulated during vitellogenic stages, with specific expression patterns depending on the organism's environment, diet, and season. Vtg , ProR , ODP , and FaMet could serve as molecular markers for both wild and cultured organisms.; Competing Interests: Fernando Marino Pinzon-Miranda is an employee of Fitmar.

Changes in glycosylation patterns are associated with many human diseases and conditions. Understanding the biological determinants of protein glycome provides a basis for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allow to study biology via a hypothesis-free search of loci and genetic variants associated with a trait of interest. Sixteen loci were identified by three previous GWAS of human plasma proteome N-glycosylation. However, the possibility that some of these loci are false positives needs to be eliminated by replication studies, which have been limited so far. Here, we use the largest set of samples so far (4802 individuals) to replicate the previously identified loci. For all but one locus, the expected replication power exceeded 95%. Of the 16 loci reported previously, 15 were replicated in our study. For the remaining locus (near the KREMEN1 gene), the replication power was low, and hence, replication results were inconclusive. The very high replication rate highlights the general robustness of the GWAS findings as well as the high standards adopted by the community that studies genetic regulation of protein glycosylation. The 15 replicated loci present a good target for further functional studies. Among these, eight loci contain genes encoding glycosyltransferases: MGAT5, B3GAT1, FUT8, FUT6, ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, ST3GAL4 and MGAT3. The remaining seven loci offer starting points for further functional follow-up investigation into molecules and mechanisms that regulate human protein N-glycosylation in vivo.

In Phase I, a common protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) were implemented by independent investigators using the Aetion Evidence PlatformÂ® (AEP), a rapid-cycle analytics tool, and SAS statistical software as a gold standard for statistical analyses. Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) dataset, the study included patients newly diagnosed with MM within primary care setting and assessed baseline demographics, conditions, drug exposure, and laboratory procedures. Phase II incorporated analysis revisions based on our initial comparison of the Phase I findings. Reproducibility of findings was evaluate by calculating the match rate and absolute difference in prevalence between the SAS and AEP study results.; Results: Phase I yielded slightly discrepant results, prompting amendments to SAP to add more clarity to operational decisions. After detailed specification of data and operational choices, exact concordance was achieved for the number of eligible patients (N = 2646), demographics, comorbidities (i.e., osteopenia, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease [CVD], and hypertension), bone pain, skeletal-related events, drug exposure, and laboratory investigations in the Phase II analyses.; Conclusions: In this reproducibility study, a rapid-cycle analytics tool and traditional statistical software achieved near-exact findings after detailed specification of data and operational choices. Transparency and communication of the study design, operational and analytical choices between independent investigators were critical to achieve this reproducibility. (Â© 2020 The Authors.

(2009) devised a questionnaire for measuring children's awareness of stuttering and showed that even very young children were often aware of their stuttering. There has been no replication of studies using Boey et al.'s parent-reported questionnaire. The aim of this study was to test whether using Boey et al.'s seven questions, developed for a Dutch speaking population could be effective for measuring the awareness of stuttering in Japanese children.; Methods: Participants were 54 children who stutter (CWS) aged 3-7Â years. Parents answered seven questions about their child's awareness of stuttering according to the questions developed Boey et al. RESULTS: Parental-reported observations of the child responses citing at least one awareness incident were 76%. The percentage of stuttering children with awareness of their own speech difficulties, according to chronological age, were as follows: 70% at age 3Â years; 67% at age 4Â years; 75% at age 5Â years; 81% at age 6Â years; and 90% at age 7Â years.; Conclusions: We found that even at age 3Â years, many CWS were already aware of their stuttering. The similarity of the data with the seminal study by Boey et al. suggests that the question-based assessment is reproducible even in a country with a different spoken language. The seven questions in Boey et al. are useful for evaluating whether children's awareness of stuttering could contribute to a clinical decision as well as stuttering severity.

Researchers have used various models to predict the maximum extent of the number of cases and the time of peak. This yielded varying numbers. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (R) for COVID-19 over time using incident number of cases that are reported by the government.; Methods: Exponential Growth method to estimate basic reproduction rate R 0 , and Time dependent method to calculate the effective reproduction number (dynamic) were used. "R0" package in R software was used to estimate these statistics.; Results: The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for India was estimated at 1.379 (95% CI: 1.375, 1.384). This was 1.450 (1.441, 1.460) for Maharashtra, 1.444 (1.430, 1.460) for Gujarat, 1.297 (1.284, 1.310) for Delhi and 1.405 (1.389, 1.421) for Tamil Nadu. In India, the R at the first week from March 2-8, 2020 was 3.2. It remained around 2 units for three weeks, from March 9-29, 2020. After March 2020, it started declining and reached around 1.3 in the following week suggesting a stabilisation of the transmissibility rate.; Conclusion: The study estimated a baseline R 0 of 1.379 for India. It also showed that the R was getting stabilised from first week of April (with an average RÂ of 1.29), despite the increase in March. This suggested that in due course there will be a reversal of epidemic. However, these analyses should be revised periodically.; Competing Interests: None of the authors have conflicts of interest to report. (Â© 2020 INDIACLEN.

Recently, a genome-wide association study in Alzheimer's disease has identified the PICALM rs3851179 polymorphism as one of the most significant susceptibility genes for Alzheimer's disease after APOE. The aim of this study was to determine the potential role of PICALM and its genetic interaction with APOE in the development of cognitive decline in PD.; Methods: A discovery cohort of 712 patients with PD were genotyped for PICALM (rs3851179) and APOE (rs429358 and rs7412) polymorphisms. The association of PICALM and APOE-PICALM genetic interaction with cognitive dysfunction in PD was studied using logistic regression models, and the relationship of PICALM with cognitive decline onset was assessed with Cox regression analysis. PICALM effect was then replicated in an international, independent cohort (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, N = 231).; Results: PICALM rs3851179 TT genotype was significantly associated with a decreased risk of cognitive impairment in PD (TT vs. CC + CT, P =â0.041, odds ratio = 0.309). Replication studies further demonstrated its protective effect on cognitive impairment in PD. In addition, the protective effect of the PICALM rs3851179 TT genotype was more pronounced in the APOE Îµ4 (-) carriers from the discovery cohort (P =â0.037, odds ratio = 0.241), although these results were not replicated in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort.; Conclusions: Our results support the fact that PICALM is associated with cognitive impairment in PD. The understanding of its contribution to cognitive decline in PD could provide new targets for the development of novel therapies. Â© 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

The substantial resources required by these projects limits the number of studies that can be repeated and consequently the generalizability of the findings. We extend the use of a method from Jager and Leek to estimate the false discovery rate for 94 journals over a 5-year period using p values from overÂ 30,000 abstracts enabling the study of how the false discovery rate varies by journal characteristics.; Results: We find that the empirical false discovery rate is higher for cancer versus general medicine journals (pâ=â9.801E-07, 95% CI: 0.045, 0.097; adjusted mean false discovery rate cancerâ=â0.264 vs. general medicineâ=â0.194). We also find that false discovery rate is negatively associated with log journal impact factor. A two-fold decrease in journal impact factor is associated with an average increase of 0.020 in FDR (pâ=â2.545E-04). Conversely, we find no statistically significant evidence of a higher false discovery rate, on average, for Open Access versus closed access journals (pâ=â0.320, 95% CI -â0.015, 0.046, adjusted mean false discovery rate Open Accessâ=â0.241 vs. closed accessâ=â0.225).; Conclusions: Our results identify areas of research that may need additional scrutiny and support to facilitate replicable science. Given our publicly available R code and data, others can complete a broad assessment of the empirical false discovery rate across other subject areas and characteristics of published research.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=33297936&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pereira Junior, Amilcar Machado</author><author>Camargo-Mathias, M I</author><author>Daemon, E</author><author>Peconick, A P</author><author>Lima-Souza, J R</author><author>Oliveira, P R</author><author>Braga, A S</author><author>Lara, L J</author><author>Remedio, R N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficacy of carvacrol on Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus engorged female ticks (Canestrini, 1887) (Acari: Ixodidae): effects on mortality and reproduction.</title><secondary-title>Natural product research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Natural product research</full-title><abbr-1>Natural product research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3428-3431</pages><volume>34</volume><number>23</number><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Acaricides/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>cattle</keyword><keyword>control</keyword><keyword>Cymenes/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fertility</keyword><keyword>LC50</keyword><keyword>Lethal Dose 50</keyword><keyword>Mortality</keyword><keyword>Oviposition/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Phytotherapy</keyword><keyword>Reproduction</keyword><keyword>Rhipicephalus/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Rhipicephalus/*physiology</keyword><keyword>ticks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1478-6427</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14786419.2019.1569657</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The activity of carvacrol was evaluated in R. microplus female ticks by estimating the mean lethal concentration (LC 50 ) and the acaricidal efficacy.

Analyzing ratings outcomes of 7,355 small-ensemble and solo events from two consecutive midwestern state festivals (2001 and 2002), Bergee and Platt found statistically significant differences in the main effects of time of day, type of event (solo/ensemble), and school size. In the replication phase of the present study, we used their procedures to analyze data from the 2003 festival (N = 3,853), finding significant differences in the same three main effects and also performing medium (vocal/instrumental). In both studies, the type of event by performing medium interaction was significant. The extension phase consisted of applying logistic regression techniques to the fitting of a theoretical model of prediction. Two variables were added to the original four--geographical location and district level of expenditure per average daily attendance. All main effects except geographical location (eliminated owing to high collinearity), plus the type of event by performing medium interaction, emerged as strong predictors of ratings outcomes. Afternoon scheduling, entering from a large, relatively high-expenditure school, and performing as a vocalist and a soloist significantly predicted the highest rating.

Successful replication attempts increase researchersâ confidence in the presence of an effect, whereas failed replication attempts induce skepticism and doubt. However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attempt results in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes we propose a novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of 2 competing hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic and holds that the effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis that postulates a zero effect size, Hâ : Î´ = 0. The 2nd hypothesis is that of the proponent and holds that the effect is consistent with the one found in the original study, an effect that can be quantified by a posterior distribution. Hence, the 2nd hypothesisâthe replication hypothesisâis given by Hr : Î´ â¼ 'posterior distribution from original study.' The weighted-likelihood ratio between Hâ and Hr quantifies the evidence that the data provide for replication success and failure. In addition to the new test, we present several other Bayesian tests that address different but related questions concerning a replication study. These tests pertain to the independent conclusions of the separate experiments, the difference in effect size between the original experiment and the replication attempt, and the overall conclusion based on the pooled results. Together, this suite of Bayesian tests allows a relatively complete formalization of the way in which the result of a replication attempt alters our knowledge of the phenomenon at hand. The use of all Bayesian replication tests is illustrated with 3 examples from the literature. For experiments analyzed using the t test, computation of the new replication test only requires the t values and the numbers of participants from the original study and the replication study.

They respond well to treatment with a daily massage protocol directed at tactile abnormalities (QST massage for autism). Treatment is based on a model for autism proposing that tactile impairment poses a barrier to development. Two previous randomized controlled trials evaluating five months of massage treatment reported improvement of behavior, social/communication skills, and tactile and other sensory symptoms. This is the first report from a two-year replication study evaluating the protocol in 103 preschool children with autism. Parents gave daily treatment; trained staff gave weekly treatment and parent support. Five-month outcomes replicated earlier studies and showed normalization of receptive language (18%, P = .03), autistic behavior (32%, P = .006), total sensory abnormalities (38%, P = .0000005), tactile abnormalities (49%, P = .0002), and decreased autism severity (medium to large effect size, P = .008). In addition, parents reported improved child-to-parent interactions, bonding, and decreased parenting stress (44%, P = .00008). Early childhood special education programs are tasked with addressing sensory abnormalities and engaging parents in effective home programs. Until now, they have lacked research-based methods to do so. This program fulfills the need. It is recommended to parents and ECSE programs (ages 3-5) at autism diagnosis.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25878901&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yoo, Ji Young</author><author>Hurwitz, Brian S</author><author>Bolyard, Chelsea</author><author>Yu, Jun-Ge</author><author>Zhang, Jianying</author><author>Selvendiran, Karuppaiyah</author><author>Rath, Kellie S</author><author>He, Shun</author><author>Bailey, Zachary</author><author>Eaves, David</author><author>Cripe, Timothy P</author><author>Parris, Deborah S</author><author>Caligiuri, Michael A</author><author>Yu, Jianhua</author><author>Old, Matthew</author><author>Kaur, Balveen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bortezomib-induced unfolded protein response increases oncolytic HSV-1 replication resulting in synergistic antitumor effects.</title><secondary-title>Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</full-title><abbr-1>Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3787-3798</pages><volume>20</volume><number>14</number><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Boronic Acids/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Bortezomib</keyword><keyword>Cell Line, Tumor</keyword><keyword>Combined Modality Therapy</keyword><keyword>Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP</keyword><keyword>Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Human/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice, Nude</keyword><keyword>Necrosis</keyword><keyword>Oncolytic Virotherapy</keyword><keyword>Oncolytic Viruses/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Pyrazines/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Unfolded Protein Response/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword><keyword>Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-07-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1557-3265</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0553</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Bortezomib is an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor, and oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (oHSV) is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer. We tested the impact of combining bortezomib with oHSV for antitumor efficacy.; Experimental Design: The synergistic interaction between oHSV and bortezomib was calculated using Chou-Talalay analysis. Viral replication was evaluated using plaque assay and immune fluorescence. Western blot assays were used to evaluate induction of estrogen receptor (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR). Inhibitors targeting Hsp90 were utilized to investigate the mechanism of cell killing. Antitumor efficacy in vivo was evaluated using subcutaneous and intracranial tumor xenografts of glioma and head and neck cancer. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and two-sided log-rank test.; Results: Combination treatment with bortezomib and oHSV (34.5ENVE), displayed strong synergistic interaction in ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer, glioma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells. Bortezomib treatment induced ER stress, evident by strong induction of Grp78, CHOP, PERK, and IRE1Î± (Western blot analysis) and the UPR (induction of hsp40, 70, and 90). Bortezomib treatment of cells at both sublethal and lethal doses increased viral replication (P &lt; 0.001), but inhibition of Hsp90 ablated this response, reducing viral replication and synergistic cell killing. The combination of bortezomib and 34.5ENVE significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy in multiple different tumor models in vivo.; Conclusions: The dramatic synergy of bortezomib and 34.5ENVE is mediated by bortezomib-induced UPR and warrants future clinical testing in patients.

The switch from the plasmid-encoded sequence 5'-CATCATCA-3' to the alternative sequence 5'-CTATCTAT-3' in the ITRs was found to be a general in vitro propagation phenomenon, as shown for several vectors carrying different transgenes or being derived from different adenovirus serotypes. In each tested case, the plasmid-encoded ITR sequence changed to exactly the same alternative ITR sequence, 5'-CTATCTAT-3'. The outgrowth of this alternative ITR version should result from a growth advantage conferred by the alternative ITR sequence. Indeed, replication kinetics studies of rAd35 harbouring either the original or alternative ITR sequence confirmed an increase in replication speed for rAd35 vectors with the alternative ITR sequence. These findings can be applied to generate recombinant adenoviral vectors harbouring the alternative ITR sequence, which will facilitate the generation of genetically homogeneous seed virus batches. Moreover, vector production may be accelerated by taking advantage of the observed improved replication kinetics associated with the alternative ITR sequence.

More recently, the concept of attachment has been extended to adults, and several measures that purport to measure attachment style have been developed. The purpose of the present study was to provide a reliability generalization study of five of the most prominent adult attachment style measures. Reliability generalization, a relatively new meta-analytic reliability procedure, was used to (a) identify the typical reliability of scores across instruments and studies and (b) examine sources of measurement error across instruments and studies. Results from this investigation of 154 previously published research studies indicated that the average score reliability across studies varied considerably across instruments and subscales. Implications for the use of self-report measures of adult attachment style are offered.

We used a repeated measures design with 14 healthy volunteers. Measures of velocity replication were performed in two ranges of knee joint flexion, across four testing velocities (5, 10, 15, and 30Â°/s in two movement directions. Statistical analysis included intraclass correlation coefficients and associated standard error of the measures calculated between day 1 and 2. We performed z-tests between all possible combinations of ICC pairs using Fisher's Z transformations to determine if any significant differences existed between observed ICCs. We also calculated correlation ratios to explain the source of variability in the calculated ICCs. To assess measurement accuracy, we calculated constant error and absolute error between criterion and replication velocities. Results on ICCs and standard error of the measurements (SEMs) ranged from r = -0.44 Â±7.00 to 0.88Â±0.72Â°/s. Significantly more absolute error occurred at 30 and 15Â°/s compared with 5Â°/s. Significantly less constant error was observed for 30Â°/s compared with 15Â°/s. The data support the use of velocity replication in future investigations on proprioceptive function.

The intrinsic generalization of a representation provides a novel way to measure its generalization and leads to more fundamental insights than the commonly used recognition performance, which is heavily influenced by the choice of training and test data. We demonstrate the limitations of linear subspace representations by sampling their intrinsic generalization, and propose a nonlinear representation that overcomes these limitations. The proposed representation projects images nonlinearly into the marginal densities of their filter responses, followed by linear projections of the marginals. We use experiments on large datasets to show that the representations that have better intrinsic generalization also lead to better recognition performance.

A male (aged 61 yrs) with severe agraphia completed a copy and recall treatment for 2 sets of words trained sequentially. Assessed was generalization of training improvements to untrained words with similar beginning or ending spellings and nonwords. Results show that the S improved spelling of the 2 sets of trained words. He also demonstrated generalized improvements in spelling some untrained whole words. Generalization was greater for parts of untrained words that were similar in spelling to trained words, and was also greater for the beginnings compared to the endings of words. Findings suggest that the pattern of spelling generalization observed implicates improvements affecting 2 stages of spelling. Greater improvements when spelling beginning or ending parts of untrained words with similar spellings to trained words implicates changes mediated by the orthographic output lexicon. Improvements for some untrained words and an advantage to beginning over ending spellings suggests strengthening of the graphemic buffer.

A total of 816 research articles utilizing the STAI between 1990 and 2000 were reviewed and classified as having (a) ignored reliability (73%), (b) mentioned reliability or reported reliability coefficients from another source (21 %), or (c) computed reliability for the data at hand (6%). Articles in medically oriented journals were shorter and somewhat less likely to mention or compute reliability than nonmedically oriented articles, perhaps due to paradigm differences. Average reliability coefficients were acceptable for both internal consistency and test-retest, but variation was present among the estimates. State test-retest coefficients were lower than internal consistency coefficients. Score variability was predictive of internal consistency reliability for scores on both scales. Other predictors were the age of research participants, the form of the STAI, and the type research design.

The main components of the pathway are the integral membrane heterotrimeric SecYEG complex and the peripheral membrane ATPase, SecA. In this study, we have applied an in vitro assay using inverted cytoplasmic membrane vesicles to investigate the complex cycle that leads to translocation. We compared the apparent rate constants for nine precursors under two experimental conditions, single turnover and multiple turnovers. For each precursor, the rate constant for a single turnover was higher than for multiple turnovers, indicating that a different step limits the rate under the two conditions. We conclude that the rate-limiting step for a single turnover is an early step in the initial phase of transit through the channel, whereas the rate of multiple turnovers is limited by the resetting of the translocon. The presence of the chaperone SecB during multiple turnovers increased the maximal amplitude translocated for the three precursor species tested, pGBP, pPhoA, and proOmpA, and also increased the apparent rate constants for both pGBP and pPhoA. The rate constant for proOmpA was decreased by the presence of SecB. IMPORTANCE Vastly different experimental techniques and conditions have been used to study export in E. coli We demonstrated that altering experimental conditions can change the step that is observed during study. Investigators should consider specific experimental conditions when comparing data from different laboratories, as well as when comparing data from different experiments within a laboratory. We have shown that each precursor species has inherent properties that determine the translocation rate; thus generalizations from studies of a single species must be made with caution. A summary of advantages and disadvantages in use of nine precursors is presented.

This resource was mined to identify emerging mutations and trends in mutations as the outbreak progressed over time. Information on transmission dynamics, prevalence, and persistence of intra-host mutants, and the position of a mutation on a protein were then used to prioritize 544 reported mutations based on their ability to impact ZIKV phenotype. Using this criteria, six mutants (representing naturally occurring mutations) were generated as synthetic infectious clones using a 2015 Puerto Rican epidemic strain PRVABC59 as the parental backbone. The phenotypes of these naturally occurring variants were examined using both cell culture and murine model systems. Mutants had distinct phenotypes, including changes in replication rate, embryo death, and decreased head size. In particular, a NS2B mutant previously detected during in vivo studies in rhesus macaques was found to cause lethal infections in adult mice, abortions in pregnant females, and increased viral genome copies in both brain tissue and blood of female mice. Additionally, mutants with changes in the region of NS3 that interfaces with NS5 during replication displayed reduced replication in the blood of adult mice. This analytical pathway, integrating both bioinformatic and wet lab experiments, provides a foundation for understanding how naturally occurring single mutations affect disease outcome and can be used to predict the of severity of future ZIKV outbreaks. To determine if naturally occurring individual mutations in the Zika virus epidemic genotype affect viral virulence or replication rate in vitro or in vivo, we generated an infectious clone representing the epidemic genotype of stain Puerto Rico, 2015. Using this clone, six mutants were created by changing nucleotides in the genome to cause one to two amino acid substitutions in the encoded proteins. The six mutants we generated represent mutations that differentiated the early epidemic genotype from genotypes that were either ancestral or that occurred later in the epidemic. We assayed each mutant for changes in growth rate, and for virulence in adult mice and pregnant mice. Three of the mutants caused catastrophic embryo effects including increased embryonic death or significant decrease in head diameter. Three other mutants that had mutations in a genome region associated with replication resulted in changes in in vitro and in vivo replication rates. These results illustrate the potential impact of individual mutations in viral phenotype.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=33198111&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>TatÃ¡r-Kis, Timea</author><author>Fischer, Egil A J</author><author>Cazaban, Christophe</author><author>WalkÃ³-KovÃ¡cs, Edit</author><author>Homonnay, Zalan G</author><author>Velkers, Francisca C</author><author>Palya, Vilmos</author><author>Stegeman, J Arjan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Herpesvirus of Turkey-Based Vector Vaccine Reduces Transmission of Newcastle Disease Virus in Commercial Broiler Chickens with Maternally Derived Antibodies.</title><secondary-title>Vaccines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccines</full-title><abbr-1>Vaccines</abbr-1></periodical><volume>8</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>challenge experiment</keyword><keyword>Newcastle disease</keyword><keyword>poultry</keyword><keyword>R</keyword><keyword>recombinant vaccine</keyword><keyword>reproduction number</keyword><keyword>shedding control</keyword><keyword>transmission</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-10-16</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2076-393X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/vaccines8040614</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Newcastle Disease is one of the most important infectious poultry diseases worldwide and is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. In several countries, vaccination is applied to prevent and control outbreaks; however, information on the ability of vaccines to reduce transmission of ND virus (NDV) is sparse. Here we quantified the transmission of velogenic NDV among 42-day-old broilers. Chickens were either vaccinated with a single dose of a vector vaccine expressing the F protein (rHVT-ND) at day-old in the presence of maternally derived antibodies or kept unvaccinated. Seeders were challenged 8 h before the co-mingling with the corresponding contacts from the same group. Infection was monitored by daily testing of cloacal and oro-nasal swabs with reverse transcription-real-time PCR and by serology. Vaccinated birds were completely protected against clinical disease and virus excretion was significantly reduced compared to the unvaccinated controls that all died during the experiment. The reproduction ratio, which is the average number of secondary infections caused by an infectious bird, was significantly lower in the vaccinated group (0.82 (95% CI 0.38-1.75)) than in the unvaccinated group (3.2 (95% CI 2.06-4.96)). Results of this study demonstrate the potential of rHVT-ND vaccine in prevention and control of ND outbreaks.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=33081359&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bingham, Paul</author><author>Wada, Masako</author><author>van Andel, Mary</author><author>McFadden, Andrew</author><author>Sanson, Robert</author><author>Stevenson, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-Time Standard Analysis of Disease Investigation (SADI)-A Toolbox Approach to Inform Disease Outbreak Response.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</full-title><abbr-1>Frontiers in veterinary science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>563140</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>big data</keyword><keyword>centralised data warehouse</keyword><keyword>decision support tool</keyword><keyword>foot-and-mouth disease</keyword><keyword>outbreak investigations</keyword><keyword>outbreak response</keyword><keyword>real-time analyses</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-09-29</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2297-1769</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2020.563140</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An incursion of an important exotic transboundary animal disease requires a prompt and intensive response. The routine analysis of up-to-date data, as near to real time as possible, is essential for the objective assessment of the patterns of disease spread or effectiveness of control measures and the formulation of alternative control strategies. In this paper, we describe the Standard Analysis of Disease Investigation (SADI), a toolbox for informing disease outbreak response, which was developed as part of New Zealand's biosecurity preparedness. SADI was generically designed on a web-based software platform, Integrated Real-time Information System (IRIS). We demonstrated the use of SADI for a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak scenario in New Zealand. The data standards were set within SADI, accommodating a single relational database that integrated the national livestock population data, outbreak data, and tracing data. We collected a well-researched, standardised set of 16 epidemiologically relevant analyses for informing the FMD outbreak response, including farm response timelines, interactive outbreak/network maps, stratified epidemic curves, estimated dissemination rates, estimated reproduction numbers, and areal attack rates. The analyses were programmed within SADI to automate the process to generate the reports at a regular interval (daily) using the most up-to-date data. Having SADI prepared in advance and the process streamlined for data collection, analysis and reporting would free a wider group of epidemiologists during an actual disease outbreak from solving data inconsistency among response teams, daily "number crunching," or providing largely retrospective analyses. Instead, the focus could be directed into enhancing data collection strategies, improving data quality, understanding the limitations of the data available, interpreting the set of analyses, and communicating their meaning with response teams, decision makers and public in the context of the epidemic.

Patients resident in the area covered by ATS-MI with symptom onset between February and May 2020 were selected. Different epidemic periods were considered based on the timeline of the various regional and national containment measures.; Main Outcome Measures: case fatality ratios, incidence rates, and reproduction number by epidemic period and sub-area of ATS-MI.; Results: a total of 27,017 swab-positive COVID-19 cases were included. Mean age was 65 years and males were 45%. Incidence in the ATS-MI area was 776 per 100,000 population. The number of deaths was 4,660, the crude case fatality ratio was 17.3%, higher in males (21.2%) than in females (14.0%). The estimated reproduction number registered its peak (3.0) in the early stages of the epidemic and subsequently decreased. Territorial differences were observed in the epidemic spread, with a higher incidence in the Lodi area.; Conclusions: estimated incidence and case fatality ratios were higher than national estimates for Italy.

Study 1 examined the extent to which the magnitude of replication and 2 aspects of replication, consistency and symmetry indicate recovery of true clusters for 10 CluAn algorithms. Cluster size, number of clusters, covariance structure, number of variables, sample size, and error perturbation were systematically varied. Replication indices significantly predicted recovery. Study 2 evaluated replication as an indicator of the number of true clusters within a sample. Although on the average replication indices peak in the region of the true number of clusters, choosing the number of clusters by maximum replication results in a negatively biased estimate. A proposed 'scree test' attenuates this bias, however, and improves accuracy.

Specifically, this study explored correlations between PPAT's symbolic content with cognitive (executive functions) and emotional behaviors, self-potency, and motivation of 126 children who were measured by valid tools, respectively: four BRIEF scales (Gioia, Isquith, Guy, &amp; Kenworthy, 2000), three CBCL scalesâChild Behavior Check List (Achenbach, 1991), CAMPâChild Adaptation and Measure of Potency (Lev-Weizel, Besser, &amp; Laish, 2005); and the CMS: Children's Motivation Scale (Gerring et al., 1996). The SC-PPAT/c was found to be a reliable tool in terms of inter-rater reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient range r =.785â.969) and valid in terms of significant associations with cognitive and emotional aspects. Significant negative correlations were found between low cognitive executive functions and the degree the person was drawn as being active in the picking process (r = â.259, p &lt; 0.01), with trunk inclines toward the person (r = â.283, p &lt; 0.01), and with degree of success in the picking process (r = â.210, p &lt; 0.05). Significant and meaningful gender differences were found in regards to the relation of PPAT with all validity criterion variables. For example, while a positive strong correlation was found between girlsâ aggressiveness and the strength of the tree r = .363 (p &lt; 0.01), a negative correlation was found between boy's aggressiveness and the quantity of apples on the tree r = â.392 (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, while boysâ PPAT was related to motivation, girlsâ PPAT was related to self-potency. The discussion deals with the possible meanings of the current results, especially in regard to gender differences in PPAT drawings. Replication studies using clinical groups and samples from different cultures will be needed to assess the generalizability of the results and the diagnostic potential of the SC-PPAT/c with clinical populations.

Consequently we aimed to study cognitive functions in euthymic bipolar patients and factors affecting them. Methods: It is a cross sectional case-control study of 60 euthymic bipolar patients and 30 matched healthy controls. They were subjected to: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders, (SCID-I) to ascertain clinical diagnosis, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) to validate euthymia. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) for general intellectual abilities, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) for memory, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) for executive functions, Continuous Performance Test (CPT) for attention and impulsivity, and an information sheet gathering patient data. Results: Bipolar patients had statistically significant lower mean IQ scores in all WAIS subscales (p = 0.000), significantly lower memory abilities especially digit span and visual memory, higher impulsivity and inattention (p = 0.000) but no significant difference in response time by CPT. They displayed significantly lower executive performance on WCST. Patientsâ years of education correlated positively with IQ. Hospital admission, number, type of episodes and total number of episodes affected memory functions. Hospital admission and number of hypomanic episodes correlated with attention and impulsivity. Previous hospitalization correlated with executive functions. Conclusions: Euthymic bipolar patients exhibit cognitive deficits, which correlated with clinical variables as number, type of episodes and previous hospitalization, this knowledge could help minimize cognitive impairments for future patients. Limitations: The small sample size, cross sectional design and lack of premorbid cognitive assessment limit generalization of findings.

Method: A search of 9 databases was used to find peer-reviewed treatment articles from 1970 to 2012 of all levels of evidence with published communication outcomes for children with CAS. Improvement rate differences (IRDs) were calculated for articles with replicated (n &gt; 1), statistically compared treatment and generalization evidence. Results: Forty-two articles representing Phase I and II single-case experimental designs (SCEDs; n = 23) or case series or description studies (n = 19) were analyzed. Six articles showed high CAS diagnosis confidence. Of the 13 approaches within the 23 SCED articles, treatments were primarily for speech motor skills (n = 6), linguistic skills (n = 5), or augmentative and alternative communication (n = 2). Most participants responded positively to treatment, but only 7 of 13 approaches in SCED studies reported maintenance and/or generalization of treatment effects. Three approaches had preponderant evidence (Smith, 1981). IRD effect sizes were calculated for Integral Stimulation/Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cueing, Rapid Syllable Transition Treatment, and Integrated Phonological Awareness Intervention. Conclusions: At least 3 treatments have sufficient evidence for Phase III trials and interim clinical practice. In the future, efficacy needs to be established via maintenance and generalization measures.

Due to the absence of conditioning studies assessing generalization in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), results of this meta-analysis do not reveal whether such generalization abnormalities also apply to GAD. The current study fills this gap by behaviorally and psychophysiologically assessing levels of conditioned fear generalization across adults with and without GAD. Methods: Twenty-two patients with a DSM-IV-Text Revision diagnosis of GAD and 26 healthy comparison subjects were recruited and tested. The employed generalization paradigm consisted of quasi-randomly presented rings of gradually increasing size, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+) and conditioned safety cues. The rings of intermediary size served as generalization stimuli, creating a continuum of similarity between CS+ and conditioned safety cues across which to assess response slopes, referred to as generalization gradients. Primary outcome variables included slopes for fear-potentiated startle (electromyography) and self-reported risk ratings. Results: Behavioral and psychophysiological findings demonstrated overgeneralization of conditioned fear among patients with GAD. Specifically, generalization gradients were abnormally shallow among GAD patients, reflecting less degradation of the conditioned fear response as the presented stimulus differentiated from the CS+. Conclusions: Overgeneralization of conditioned fear to safe encounters resembling feared situations may contribute importantly to the psychopathology of GAD by proliferating anxiety cues in the individualâs environment that are then capable of evoking and maintaining anxiety and worry associated with GAD.

We summarized these studies based on the year of publication, prediction tasks, machine learning algorithm, dataset(s) used to build the models, the scope, category, and evaluation of the XAI methods. We further assessed the reproducibility of the studies in terms of the availability of data and code and discussed open issues and challenges.; Results: Forty-two articles were included in this review. We reported the research trend and most-studied diseases. We grouped XAI methods into 5 categories: knowledge distillation and rule extraction (Nâ=â13), intrinsically interpretable models (Nâ=â9), data dimensionality reduction (Nâ=â8), attention mechanism (Nâ=â7), and feature interaction and importance (Nâ=â5).; Discussion: XAI evaluation is an open issue that requiresÂ a deeper focus in the case of medical applications. We also discuss the importance of reproducibility of research work in this field, as well as the challenges and opportunities of XAI from 2 medical professionals' point of view.; Conclusion: Based on our review, we found that XAI evaluation in medicine has not been adequately and formally practiced. Reproducibility remains a critical concern. Ample opportunities exist to advance XAI research in medicine. (Â© The Author(s) 2020.

Here, we report the discovery, using RNA-seq, of three new partiti-like viruses from African armyworm, Spodoptera exempta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), which are all vertically-transmitted transovarially from mother to offspring with high efficiency. Experimental studies show that the viruses reduce their host's growth rate and reproduction, but enhance their resistance to a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV). Via microinjection, these partiti-like viruses were transinfected into a novel host, a newly-invasive crop pest in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the Fall armyworm, S. frugiperda. This revealed that in this new host, these viruses appear to be deleterious without any detectable benefit; reducing their new host's reproductive rate and increasing their susceptibility to NPV. Thus, the partiti-like viruses appear to be conditional mutualistic symbionts in their normal host, S. exempta, but parasitic in the novel host, S. frugiperda. Transcriptome analysis of S. exempta and S. frugiperda infected, or not, with the partiti-like viruses indicates that the viruses may regulate pathways related to immunity and reproduction. These findings suggest a possible pest management strategy via the artificial host-shift of novel viruses discovered by NGS.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=32569314&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foo, Jia Nee</author><author>Chew, Elaine Guo Yan</author><author>Chung, Sun Ju</author><author>Peng, Rong</author><author>Blauwendraat, Cornelis</author><author>Nalls, Mike A</author><author>Mok, Kin Y</author><author>Satake, Wataru</author><author>Toda, Tatsushi</author><author>Chao, Yinxia</author><author>Tan, Louis C S</author><author>Tandiono, Moses</author><author>Lian, Michelle M</author><author>Ng, Ebonne Y</author><author>Prakash, Kumar-M</author><author>Au, Wing-Lok</author><author>Meah, Wee-Yang</author><author>Mok, Shi Qi</author><author>Annuar, Azlina Ahmad</author><author>Chan, Anne Y Y</author><author>Chen, Ling</author><author>Chen, Yongping</author><author>Jeon, Beom S</author><author>Jiang, Lulu</author><author>Lim, Jia Lun</author><author>Lin, Juei-Jueng</author><author>Liu, Chunfeng</author><author>Mao, Chengjie</author><author>Mok, Vincent</author><author>Pei, Zhong</author><author>Shang, Hui-Fang</author><author>Shi, Chang-He</author><author>Song, Kyuyoung</author><author>Tan, Ai Huey</author><author>Wu, Yih-Ru</author><author>Xu, Yu-Ming</author><author>Xu, Renshi</author><author>Yan, Yaping</author><author>Yang, Jing</author><author>Zhang, BaoRong</author><author>Koh, Woon-Puay</author><author>Lim, Shen-Yang</author><author>Khor, Chiea Chuen</author><author>Liu, Jianjun</author><author>Tan, Eng-King</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of Risk Loci for Parkinson Disease in Asians and Comparison of Risk Between Asians and Europeans: A Genome-Wide Association Study.</title><secondary-title>JAMA neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA neurology</full-title><abbr-1>JAMA neurology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>746-754</pages><volume>77</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Asian People/genetics</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Parkinson Disease/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>White People/genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-06-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2168-6157</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.0428</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Importance: Large-scale genome-wide association studies in the European population have identified 90 risk variants associated with Parkinson disease (PD); however, there are limited studies in the largest population worldwide (ie, Asian).; Objectives: To identify novel genome-wide significant loci for PD in Asian individuals and to compare genetic risk between Asian and European cohorts.; Design Setting, and Participants: Genome-wide association data generated from PD cases and controls in an Asian population (ie, Singapore/Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, mainland China, and South Korea) were collected from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, as part of an ongoing study. Results were combined with inverse variance meta-analysis, and replication of top loci in European and Japanese samples was performed. Discovery samples of 31â¯575 individuals passing quality control of 35â¯994 recruited were used, with a greater than 90% participation rate. A replication cohort of 1â¯926â¯361 European-ancestry and 3509 Japanese samples was analyzed. Parkinson disease was diagnosed using UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Genotypes of common variants, association with disease status, and polygenic risk scores.; Results: Of 31â¯575 samples identified, 6724 PD cases (mean [SD] age, 64.3â[10] years; age at onset, 58.8 [10.6] years; 3472 [53.2%] men) and 24â¯851 controls (age, 59.4 [11.4] years; 11â¯030 [45.0%] men) were analyzed in the discovery study. Eleven genome-wide significant loci were identified; 2 of these loci were novel (SV2C and WBSCR17) and 9 were previously found in Europeans. Replication in European-ancestry and Japanese samples showed robust association for SV2C (rs246814; odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.11-1.21; Pâ=â1.17âÃâ10-10 in meta-analysis of discovery and replication samples) but showed potential genetic heterogeneity at WBSCR17 (rs9638616; I2=67.1%; Pâ=â3.40âÃâ10-3 for hetereogeneity). Polygenic risk score models including variants at these 11 loci were associated with a significant improvement in area under the curve over the model based on 78 European loci alone (63.1% vs 60.2%; Pâ=â6.81âÃâ10-12).; Conclusions and Relevance: This study identified 2 apparently novel gene loci and found 9 previously identified European loci to be associated with PD in this large, meta-genome-wide association study in a worldwide population of Asian individuals and reports similarities and differences in genetic risk factors between Asian and European individuals in the risk for PD. These findings may lead to improved stratification of Asian patients and controls based on polygenic risk scores. Our findings have potential academic and clinical importance for risk stratification and precision medicine in Asia.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=32310270&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scarsellone, Jana M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of observational data in speech and language research using generalizability theory</title><secondary-title>Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1341-1347</pages><volume>41</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>analysis of observational data in speech &amp; language research using generalizability theory</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Language</keyword><keyword>Language Disorders</keyword><keyword>Models, Theoretical</keyword><keyword>Observation Methods</keyword><keyword>Research</keyword><keyword>Speech</keyword><keyword>Speech Disorders</keyword><keyword>Theories</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1092-4388</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1044/jslhr.4106.1341</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Most research in speech-language pathology relies on observational data collected by human observers or judges. The reliability and generalizability of such measurements are always important considerations. This article reviews classical methods of estimating reliability and proposes that a more powerful approach capable of estimating the dependability of behavioral measurements is available. This approach, based on generalizability theory, provides a practical framework for estimating multiple sources of measurement error in the collection of observational data. Concepts central to generalizability theory are discussed, and a hypothetical data set illustrates the usefulness of generalizability measurements in speech and language research.

Previous studies of coronavirus replication complex organization and protein interactions have utilized protein overexpression studies and immunofluorescence of fixed cells. Additionally, live-imaging studies of coronavirus replicase proteins have used fluorescent reporter molecules fused to replicase proteins, but expressed from nonnative locations, mostly late-transcribed subgenomic mRNAs, in the presence or absence of the native protein. Thus, the timing and targeting of native replicase proteins expressed in real time from native locations in the genome remain unknown. In this study, we tested whether reporter molecules could be expressed from the replicase polyprotein of murine hepatitis virus as fusions with nonstructural protein 2 or 3 and whether such reporters could define the targeting and activity of replicase proteins during infection. We demonstrate that the fusion of green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase with either nonstructural protein 2 or 3 is tolerated and that these reporter-replicase fusions can be used to quantitate replication complex formation and virus replication. The results show that the replicase gene has flexibility to accommodate a foreign gene addition and can be used directly to study replicase complex formation and evolution during infection as well as to provide highly sensitive and specific markers for protein translation and genome replication.; Importance: Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that are important agents of disease, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Replication is associated with multiple virus-induced membrane structures that evolve during infection; however, the dynamics of this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we tested whether reporter molecules expressed from native locations within the replicase polyprotein of murine hepatitis virus as fusions with nonstructural proteins could define the expression and targeting of replicase proteins during infection in live cells. We demonstrate that the replicase gene tolerates the introduction of green fluorescent protein or firefly luciferase as fusions with replicase proteins. These viruses allow early quantitation of virus replication as well as real-time measurement of replication complexes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24623413&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wright, Tessa S.</author><author>Wolery, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the effectiveness of roadside instruction in teaching youth with visual impairments street crossings</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Special Education</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Special Education</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of Special Education</abbr-1></periodical><pages>46-58</pages><volume>48</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>blind</keyword><keyword>Blindness</keyword><keyword>Educational Program Evaluation</keyword><keyword>graduated guidance</keyword><keyword>Highway Safety</keyword><keyword>roadside instruction</keyword><keyword>school based intervention</keyword><keyword>School Based Intervention</keyword><keyword>street crossing</keyword><keyword>teaching methods</keyword><keyword>Teaching Methods</keyword><keyword>verbal rehearsal</keyword><keyword>Vision Disorders</keyword><keyword>visual impairments</keyword><keyword>youth education</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-4669</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0022466912453770</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A single-participant multiple probe design across participants was used to evaluate the effectiveness of verbal rehearsal and graduated guidance to teach youth who were blind how to cross the street.

Students were assessed on their essay writing, the WoodcockâJohnson Fluency subtest, writing probes, and were interviewed post instruction. Findings revealed that all students mastered the components of effective persuasive essay writing, included counterarguments, and improved from baseline to postinstruction and postfluency phases in length and essay quality.

Impaired discrimination between threat and safety is considered a hallmark of clinical anxiety. Here, we investigated the circuit-wide structural and functional mechanisms underlying vmPFC threatâsafety assessment in humans. We tested patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 32, female) and healthy controls (n = 25, age-matched female) on a task that assessed the generalization of conditioned threat during fMRI scanning. The task consisted of seven rectangles of graded widths presented on a screen; only the midsize one was paired with mild electric shock [conditioned stimulus (CS)], while the others, safety cues, systematically varied in width by Â± 20, 40, and 60% [generalization stimuli (GS)] compared with the CS. We derived an index reflecting vmPFC functioning from the BOLD reactivity on a continuum of threat (CS) to safety (GS least similar to CS); patients with GAD showed less discrimination between threat and safety cues, compared with healthy controls (Greenberg et al., 2013b). Using structural, functional (i.e., resting-state), and diffusion MRI, we measured vmPFC thickness, vmPFC functional connectivity, and vmPFC structural connectivity within the corticolimbic systems. The results demonstrate that all three factors predict individual variability of vmPFC threat assessment in an independent fashion. Moreover, these neural features are also linked to GAD, most likely via an vmPFC fear generalization. Our results strongly suggest that vmPFC threat processing is closely associated with broader corticolimbic circuit anomalies, which may synergistically contribute to clinical anxiety.

In a replication study of 229 adults, a series of CFAs showed that Revised NEO-PI scales are not simple-structured but do approximate the normative 5-factor structure. CFA goodness-of-fit indices, however, were not high. Comparability analyses showed that no more than 5 factors were replicable, which calls into question some assumptions underlying the use of CFA. An alternative method that uses targeted rotation was presented and illustrated with data from Chinese and Japanese versions of the Revised NEO-PI that clearly replicated the 5-factor structure.

These critiques as well as failures to replicate several high-profile studies have been used as justification to proclaim a 'replication crisis' in psychology. Psychologists are encouraged to conduct more 'exact' replications of published studies to assess the reproducibility of psychological research. This article argues that the alleged 'crisis of replicability' is primarily due to an epistemological misunderstanding that emphasizes the phenomenon instead of its underlying mechanisms. As a consequence, a replicated phenomenon may not serve as a rigorous test of a theoretical hypothesis because identical operationalizations of variables in studies conducted at different times and with different subject populations might test different theoretical constructs. Therefore, we propose that for meaningful replications, attempts at reinstating the original circumstances are not sufficient. Instead, replicators must ascertain that conditions are realized that reflect the theoretical variable(s) manipulated (and/or measured) in the original study.

While plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are known to induce plant defenses, endosymbiotic bacteria hosted by herbivorous insects are often beneficial to the host. Here, we aimed to assess whether PGPR-induced defenses in broad bean plants impact the pea aphid, depending on its genotype and the presence of endosymbionts. We estimated aphid reproduction, quantified defense- and growth-related phytohormones by GC-MS, and measured different plant growth and physiology parameters, after PGPR treatment. In addition, we recorded the feeding behavior of aphids by electropenetrography. We found that the PGPR treatment of broad bean plants reduced the reproduction of one of the pea aphid clones. We highlighted a phenomenon of PGPR-induced plant defense priming, but no noticeable plant growth promotion. The main changes in aphid probing behavior were related to salivation events into phloem sieve elements. We suggest that the endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa played a key role in plant-insect interactions, possibly helping aphids to counteract plant-induced resistance and allowing them to develop normally on PGPR-treated plants. Our results imply that plant- and aphid-associated microorganisms add greater complexity to the outcomes of aphid-plant interactions.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=32276327&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ertugrul, Itir Onal</author><author>Cohn, Jeffrey F</author><author>Jeni, LÃ¡szlÃ³ A</author><author>Zhang, Zheng</author><author>Yin, Lijun</author><author>Ji, Qiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Crossing Domains for AU Coding: Perspectives, Approaches, and Measures.</title><secondary-title>IEEE transactions on biometrics, behavior, and identity science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE transactions on biometrics, behavior, and identity science</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE transactions on biometrics, behavior, and identity science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>158-171</pages><volume>2</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cross-domain generalizability</keyword><keyword>facial action unit detection</keyword><keyword>transfer learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2637-6407</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/tbiom.2020.2977225</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Facial action unit (AU) detectors have performed well when trained and tested within the same domain. How well do AU detectors transfer to domains in which they have not been trained? We review literature on cross-domain transfer and conduct experiments to address limitations of prior research. We evaluate generalizability in four publicly available databases. EB + (an expanded version of BP4D + ), Sayette GFT, DISFA and UNBC Shoulder Pain (SP). The databases differ in observational scenarios, context, participant diversity, range of head pose, video resolution, and AU base rates. In most cases performance decreased with change in domain, often to below the threshold needed for behavioral research. However, exceptions were noted. Deep and shallow approaches generally performed similarly and average results were slightly better for deep model compared to shallow one. Occlusion sensitivity maps revealed that local specificity was greater for AU detection within than cross domains. The findings suggest that more varied domains and deep learning approaches may be better suited for generalizability and suggest the need for more attention to characteristics that vary between domains. Until further improvement is realized, caution is warranted when applying AU classifiers from one domain to another.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=32377637&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Batrakou, Dzmitry G</author><author>MÃ¼ller, Carolin A</author><author>Wilson, Rosemary H C</author><author>Nieduszynski, Conrad A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DNA copy-number measurement of genome replication dynamics by high-throughput sequencing: the sort-seq, sync-seq and MFA-seq family.</title><secondary-title>Nature protocols</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature protocols</full-title><abbr-1>Nature protocols</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1255-1284</pages><volume>15</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>DNA Copy Number Variations*</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication</keyword><keyword>DNA, Fungal/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Flow Cytometry</keyword><keyword>Genome, Fungal*</keyword><keyword>Genomics/methods</keyword><keyword>High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1750-2799</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41596-019-0287-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genome replication follows a defined temporal programme that can change during cellular differentiation and disease onset. DNA replication results in an increase in DNA copy number that can be measured by high-throughput sequencing. Here we present a protocol to determine genome replication dynamics using DNA copy-number measurements. Cell populations can be obtained in three variants of the method. First, sort-seq reveals the average replication dynamics across S phase in an unperturbed cell population; FACS is used to isolate replicating and non-replicating subpopulations from asynchronous cells. Second, sync-seq measures absolute replication time at specific points during S phase using a synchronized cell population. Third, marker frequency analysis can be used to reveal the average replication dynamics using copy-number analysis in any proliferating asynchronous cell culture. These approaches have been used to reveal genome replication dynamics in prokaryotes, archaea and a wide range of eukaryotes, including yeasts and mammalian cells. We have found this approach straightforward to apply to other organisms and highlight example studies from across the three domains of life. Here we present a Saccharomyces cerevisiae version of the protocol that can be performed in 7-10 d. It requires basic molecular and cellular biology skills, as well as a basic understanding of Unix and R.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=32051615&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Montecino-Latorre, Diego</author><author>Goldstein, Tracey</author><author>Gilardi, Kirsten</author><author>Wolking, David</author><author>Van Wormer, Elizabeth</author><author>Kazwala, Rudovick</author><author>Ssebide, Benard</author><author>Nziza, Julius</author><author>Sijali, Zikankuba</author><author>Cranfield, Michael</author><author>Mazet, Jonna A K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproduction of East-African bats may guide risk mitigation for coronavirus spillover.</title><secondary-title>One health outlook</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>One health outlook</full-title><abbr-1>One health outlook</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2</pages><volume>2</volume><keywords><keyword>Bats</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>East-Africa</keyword><keyword>Reproductive cycle</keyword><keyword>Seasonal</keyword><keyword>Shedding</keyword><keyword>Weaning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-02-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2524-4655</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s42522-019-0008-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Bats provide important ecosystem services; however, current evidence supports that they host several zoonotic viruses, including species of the Coronaviridae family. If bats in close interaction with humans host and shed coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, spillover may occur. Therefore, strategies aiming to mitigate potential spillover and disease emergence, while supporting the conservation of bats and their important ecological roles are needed. Past research suggests that coronavirus shedding in bats varies seasonally following their reproductive cycle; however, shedding dynamics have been assessed in only a few species, which does not allow for generalization of findings across bat taxa and geographic regions.; Methods: To assess the generalizability of coronavirus shedding seasonality, we sampled hundreds of bats belonging to several species with different life history traits across East Africa at different times of the year. We assessed, via Bayesian modeling, the hypothesis that chiropterans, across species and spatial domains, experience seasonal trends in coronavirus shedding as a function of the reproductive cycle.; Results: We found that, beyond spatial, taxonomic, and life history differences, coronavirus shedding is more expected when pups are becoming independent from the dam and that juvenile bats are prone to shed these viruses.; Conclusions: These findings could guide policy aimed at the prevention of spillover in limited-resource settings, where longitudinal surveillance is not feasible, by identifying high-risk periods for coronavirus shedding. In these periods, contact with bats should be avoided (for example, by impeding or forbidding people access to caves). Our proposed strategy provides an alternative to culling - an ethically questionable practice that may result in higher pathogen levels - and supports the conservation of bats and the delivery of their key ecosystem services.; Competing Interests: Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.

The present paper asks what comparative cognition should expect if its studies were directly replicated, and how researchers can use this information to improve the reliability of future research. Because published effect sizes are likely overestimated, comparative cognition researchers should not expect findings with p -values just below the significance level to replicate consistently. Nevertheless, there are several statistical and design features that can help researchers identify reliable research. However, researchers should not simply aim for maximum replicability when planning studies; comparative cognition faces strong replicability-validity and replicability-resource trade-offs. Next, the paper argues that it may not even be possible to perform truly direct replication studies in comparative cognition because of: 1) a lack of access to the species of interest; 2) real differences in animal behavior across sites; and 3) sample size constraints producing very uncertain statistical estimates, meaning that it will often not be possible to detect statistical differences between original and replication studies. These three reasons suggest that many claims in the comparative cognition literature are practically unfalsifiable, and this presents a challenge for cumulative science in comparative cognition. To address this challenge, comparative cognition can begin to formally assess the replicability of its findings, improve its statistical thinking and explore new infrastructures that can help to form a field that can create and combine the data necessary to understand how cognition evolves.; Competing Interests: Conflict of Interest Statement The authors report no conflicts of interest in the publication of this manuscript.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=32626823&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Chao</author><author>Laxminarayan, Srinivas</author><author>David Cashmere, J</author><author>Germain, Anne</author><author>Reifman, Jaques</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inter-channel phase differences during sleep spindles are altered in Veterans with PTSD.</title><secondary-title>NeuroImage.

To date, however, objective markers of PTSD during sleep remain elusive. Sleep spindles are distinctive bursts of brain oscillatory activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and have been implicated in sleep protection and sleep-dependent memory processes. In healthy sleep, spindles observed in electroencephalogram (EEG) data are highly synchronized across different regions of the scalp. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the spatiotemporal synchronization patterns between EEG channels during sleep spindles, as quantified by the phase-locking value (PLV) and the mean phase difference (MPD), are altered in PTSD. Using high-density (64-channel) EEG data recorded from 78 combat-exposed Veteran men (31 with PTSD and 47 without PTSD) during two consecutive nights of sleep, we examined group differences in the PLV and MPD for slow (10-13Â Hz) and fast (13-16Â Hz) spindles separately. To evaluate the reproducibility of our findings, we set apart the first 47 consecutive participants (18 with PTSD) for the initial discovery and reserved the remaining 31 participants (13 with PTSD) for replication analysis. In the discovery analysis, compared to the non-PTSD group, the PTSD group showed smaller MPDs during slow spindles between the frontal and centro-parietal channel pairs on both nights. We obtained reproducible results in the replication analysis in terms of statistical significance and effect size. The PLVs during slow or fast spindles did not significantly differ between groups. The reduced inter-channel phase difference during slow spindles in PTSD may reflect pathological changes in the underlying thalamocortical circuits. This novel finding, if independently validated, may prove useful in developing sleep-focused PTSD diagnostics and interventions.

This tool can be used to identify origins of replication, assess of directionality of forks, and measure fork speed. Over the years, the method has been used extensively to study nuclear DNA replication. The first step involves the incorporation of thymidine analogs (CldU and IdU) into nascent DNA chains and followed by their visualization with immunofluorescence using antibodies that can distinguish the two analogs. Recently, we adapted and fine-tuned DNA combing technology to the specifics of mitochondrial DNA (Phillips et al., 2017, p. 155). The protocol, which we termed mito-SMARD (mitochondrial single molecule analysis of replication DNA), provides in vivo insight into mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication with high resolution.; Competing Interests: Competing interests Agnel Sfeir is a cofounder and shareholder in Repare Therapeutics.

Three strategies are presented that social scientists and psychologists can use to empirically investigate the likely replicability of their research results. The 1st method, cross-validation, involves splitting the sample into roughly equal sized groups; one subgroups's results can then be confirmed using the 2nd subgroup's data and vice versa. The jackknife method involves conducting separate analyses with groups of Ss of an equal size deleted from each analysis one time and conducting all possible k analyses under these conditions. An analysis in which no Ss are dropped is also performed. Bootstrapping, the 3rd method, allows the consideration of many configurations of Ss and informs the researcher regarding the extent to which results generalize across types of Ss.

The model proposes that, when faced with the stressor of negative emotionality, an individual with low expectations for coping with or changing the negative emotionality (low emotion self-confidence) is more likely to consider suicidal ideation. A preliminary study in adolescents supported this hypothesis. The present paper investigated the model more fully; following up 71 adolescents 2.2â3.7 years later. The main aims were to: (a) provide further validation of the ESC-SI Model through replication; (b) evaluate stability and change in key variables over time; (c) assess the causal hypothesis that emotion self-confidence appraisals would predict later suicidal ideation. Cross-sectional analysis replicated results obtained at baseline, supporting the model. Longitudinal analysis showed negative emotionality to be moderately stable, emotion self-confidence highly stable, and suicidal ideation highly variable, over time. Baseline emotion self-confidence did not explain unique variance in later suicidal ideation, failing to establish a causal relationship over this time frame. Links between emotion self-confidence and suicidal ideation were strongest during concurrent observations; a future focus on specific emotional experiences is recommended.

However, the reproducibility of interventions can be a barrier to their dissemination. A systematic review of controlled clinical trials on the effectiveness of staff training for reducing BPSD, published between 1990 and 2013 on the EMBASE, PUBMED, LILACS, PSYCHINFO and CINAHL databases, was carried out to evaluate the reproducibility of these interventions by 3 independent raters. The presence of sufficient description of the intervention in each trial to allow its reproduction elsewhere was evaluated. Descriptive analyses were carried out. Despite reference to a detailed procedures manual in the majority of trials, these manuals were not easily accessible, limiting the replication of studies. The professional expertise requirement for training implementation was not clearly described, although most studies involved trainers with moderate to extensive expertise, further limiting training reproducibility.

The national recruitment system allows pharmacy students to apply for the 52âweeks training programmes (mandatory requirement for registration as a pharmacist), through a single application system prior to undertaking a nationally administered assessment. This study aimed to explore experiences of pharmacy students on the national recruitment scheme, particularly their views on the selection methodology, application process, and offer outcomes.; Methods: This mixed method study involved a) an online survey of all (approximate nÂ =â2800) year 4 (final year of MPharm degree) pharmacy students in England and Wales and b) a qualitative focus group with four students. The study population was eligible to participate in the 2017/18 national recruitment scheme. Survey respondents were invited to participate in a focus group. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and inferential analysis. Qualitative data were analysed using the framework technique. Participation was voluntary. Ethical approval from University of Birmingham was obtained.; Results: A total of 307 completed surveys were returned (approximate response rate 11%). Respondents were generally satisfied with the application process and commended the fairness of the selection methodology and convenience in allowing them to apply to multiple training providers. Most survey respondents (nÂ =â181, 72.9%) were either satisfied or highly satisfied with the training programme they were offered based on their assessment performances. Three themes and eight sub-themes obtained from the analysis of over 200 open comments data from the survey and transcript of a focus group with four participants. Results suggested the need to widen the timeframe available for applicants to shortlist their preferred employers, improve the method of programme listing in the application system, and consideration of prior achievements including academic performances and placement experiences to be included in the selection methodology.; Conclusions: Experiences of pharmacy students on the national recruitment scheme suggest that respondents considered the selection methodology to be fair. Student engagement and satisfaction with the recruitment system can be maximised through improved listing of employers and widening the timescales for students to shortlist their preferred employers during application process. Inclusion of University achievements in the selection methodology will require consideration of evidence based approaches. Low response rate limits generalisation of findings.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31801519&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Contina, J B</author><author>Dandurand, L M</author><author>Knudsen, G R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Predictive Risk Model Analysis of the Potato Cyst Nematode Globodera pallida in Idaho.</title><secondary-title>Plant disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant disease</full-title><abbr-1>Plant disease</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3117-3128</pages><volume>103</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Agriculture*/methods</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Globodera pallida</keyword><keyword>Idaho</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological*</keyword><keyword>potato cyst nematode</keyword><keyword>risk model analysis</keyword><keyword>Soil*/parasitology</keyword><keyword>Solanum tuberosum</keyword><keyword>Solanum tuberosum*/parasitology</keyword><keyword>SUBSTOR-DSSAT crop simulation model</keyword><keyword>Tylenchoidea*/physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0191-2917</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1094/PDIS-04-19-0717-RE</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Globodera pallida is a major nematode pest of potato ( Solanum tuberosum ) and is of great economic importance for the potato industry. Assessing potato yield loss caused by the Idaho G. pallida population under field conditions was not performed due to its quarantine status in Idaho, where it is prohibited by regulatory statutes to grow potato in any infested fields. The experimental data came from three trials that were conducted under greenhouse conditions. A predictive risk model analysis was performed to: (i) determine the effect of the Idaho population of G. pallida on potato yield; (ii) estimate reproduction rate from different initial nematode densities; and (iii) simulate potato yield losses in Idaho field conditions by integrating the coefficients of potato yield into the SUBSTOR-DSSAT crop simulation model. Experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions using five initial G. pallida soil infestation levels (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 eggs/g soil). The coefficients of potato yield achieved under each initial nematode density were integrated into the SUBSTOR-DSSAT potato growth simulation model. The model showed that tuber weight reached a maximum yield of 96 ton/ha in noninfested soil. Based on the greenhouse trials, the model predicted a minimum yield of 12 and 58 ton/ha in trial 1 and trial 2/3 respectively, when initial nematode density was 80 eggs/g soil. In trial 1, tuber weight was significantly reduced by 44% at 40 eggs/g soil and by 87% at 80 eggs/g soil, and 20% at 40 eggs/g soil and by 39% at 80 eggs/g soil in trial 2/3. The outputs of this study should facilitate common understanding between regulators, policymakers, and potato growers on the challenges and opportunities for controlling this economically important pest in Idaho.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31634034&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brezgin, Sergey</author><author>Kostyusheva, Anastasiia</author><author>Bayurova, Ekaterina</author><author>Gordeychuk, Ilya</author><author>Isaguliants, Maria</author><author>Goptar, Irina</author><author>Nikiforova, Anastasiia</author><author>Smirnov, Valery</author><author>Volchkova, Elena</author><author>Glebe, Dieter</author><author>Kostyushev, Dmitry</author><author>Chulanov, Vladimir</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replenishment of Hepatitis B Virus cccDNA Pool Is Restricted by Baseline Expression of Host Restriction Factors In Vitro.</title><secondary-title>Microorganisms</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microorganisms</full-title><abbr-1>Microorganisms</abbr-1></periodical><volume>7</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>cccDNA</keyword><keyword>CRISPR/Cas9</keyword><keyword>DNA damage</keyword><keyword>DNMT3A</keyword><keyword>gene editing</keyword><keyword>innate immunity</keyword><keyword>maintenance</keyword><keyword>methylation</keyword><keyword>persistence</keyword><keyword>rcDNA</keyword><keyword>viral replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-11-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2076-2607</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/microorganisms7110533</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major cause of viral persistence in patients with chronic HBV infection. Understanding the mechanisms underlying stability and persistence of HBV cccDNA in hepatocytes is critical for developing novel therapeutics and managing chronic hepatitis B. In this study, we observed an unexpected increase in HBV cccDNA levels upon suppression of transcription by de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and uncovered additional mechanisms potentially involved in HBV cccDNA maintenance.; Methods: HBV-expressing cell lines were transfected with a DNMT3A-expressing plasmid. Real-time PCR and HBsAg assays were used to assess the HBV replication rate. Cell cycling was analyzed by fluorescent cell sorting. CRISPR/Cas9 was utilized to abrogate expression of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B . Alterations in the expression of target genes were measured by real-time PCR.; Results: Similar to previous studies, HBV replication induced DNMT3A expression, which in turn, led to reduced HBV transcription but elevated HBV cccDNA levels (4- to 6-fold increase). Increased levels of HBV cccDNA were not related to cell cycling, as DNMT3A accelerated proliferation of infected cells and could not contribute to HBV cccDNA expansion by arresting cells in a quiescent state. At the same time, DNMT3A suppressed transcription of innate immunity factors including cytidine deaminases APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated silencing of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B transcription had minor effects on HBV transcription, but significantly increased HBV cccDNA levels, similar to DNMT3A. In an attempt to further analyze the detrimental effects of HBV and DNMT3A on infected cells, we visualized Î³-H2AX foci and demonstrated that HBV inflicts and DNMT3A aggravates DNA damage, possibly by downregulating DNA damage response factors. Additionally, suppression of HBV replication by DNMT3A may be related to reduced ATM/ATR expression.; Conclusion: Formation and maintenance of HBV cccDNA pools may be partially suppressed by the baseline expression of host inhibitory factors including APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B . HBV inflicts DNA damage both directly and by inducing DNMT3A expression.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31698767&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Duffy, Frank H.</author><author>McAnulty, Gloria B.</author><author>Albert, Marylin S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporoparietal electrophysiological differences characterize patients with Alzheimer's disease: A split-half replication study</title><secondary-title>Cerebral Cortex</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cerebral Cortex</full-title><abbr-1>Cerebral Cortex</abbr-1></periodical><pages>215-221</pages><volume>5</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>50â86 yr olds with probable Alzheimer's disease</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Alzheimer Disease</keyword><keyword>Alzheimer's Disease</keyword><keyword>Brain Mapping</keyword><keyword>Discriminant Analysis</keyword><keyword>Electroencephalography</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Parietal Lobe</keyword><keyword>Psychiatric Status Rating Scales</keyword><keyword>Stereotaxic Atlas</keyword><keyword>Temporal Lobe</keyword><keyword>topographic changes in EEG during resting wake state</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1047-3211</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cercor/5.3.215</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Examined 60 Ss with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 129 healthy controls (aged 50.55â86.58 yrs) using quantified EEG (qEEG) during the resting awake state. Differences between Ss and controls by topographic mapping demonstrated a pattern of group difference maximal posteriorly, primarily in posterior temporal and/or parietal regions. Frontal regions were much less frequently involved. Long-latency evoked potential derived difference showed similar spatial patterns of difference. By EEG spectral analysis, theta was increased and beta decreased for AD Ss. The qEEG measures were significantly correlated with neuropsychological test scores related to abilities that are impaired in the early stages of disease. To assess replicability, regions of interest derived from half the sample provided numerical measures for discriminant function analysis. The analysis correctly identified 86% of all 2nd-half Ss.

The Mobilization of Vulnerable Elders (MOVE) program is an evidence-informed early mobilization intervention that was previously evaluated in Ontario, Canada. The program was effective at improving mobilization rates and decreasing length of stay in academic hospitals. The aim of this study was to scale-up the program and conduct a replication study evaluating the impact of the evidence-informed mobilization intervention on various units in community hospitals within a different Canadian province.; Methods: The MOVE program was tailored to the local context at four community hospitals in Alberta, Canada. The study population was patients aged 65âyears and older who were admitted to medicine, surgery, rehabilitation and intensive care units between July 2015 and July 2016. The primary outcome was patient mobilization measured by conducting visual audits twice a week, three times a day. The secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay obtained from hospital administrative data, and perceptions of the intervention assessed through a qualitative assessment. Using an interrupted time series design, the intervention was evaluated over three time periods (pre-intervention, during, and post-intervention).; Results: A total of 3601 patients [mean age 80.1âyears (SDâ=â8.4âyears)] were included in the overall analysis. There was a significant increase in mobilization at the end of the intervention period compared to pre-intervention, with 6% more patients out of bed (95% confidence interval (CI) 1, 11; p-valueâ=â0.0173). A decreasing trend in median length of stay was observed, where patients on average stayed an estimated 3.59 fewer days (95%CI -15.06, 7.88) during the intervention compared to pre-intervention period.; Conclusions: MOVE is a low-cost, effective and adaptable intervention that improves mobilization in older hospitalized patients. This intervention has been replicated and scaled up across various units and hospital settings.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31653204&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mori, Jiro F</author><author>Chen, Lin-Xing</author><author>Jessen, Gerdhard L</author><author>Rudderham, Sarah B</author><author>McBeth, Joyce M</author><author>Lindsay, Matthew B J</author><author>Slater, Gregory F</author><author>Banfield, Jillian F</author><author>Warren, Lesley A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Putative Mixotrophic Nitrifying-Denitrifying Gammaproteobacteria Implicated in Nitrogen Cycling Within the Ammonia/Oxygen Transition Zone of an Oil Sands Pit Lake.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Frontiers in microbiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2435</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>nitrifier denitrification</keyword><keyword>nitrogen cycle</keyword><keyword>oil sands</keyword><keyword>shotgun metagenomics</keyword><keyword>tailings deposits</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-10-24</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1664-302X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fmicb.2019.02435</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Anthropogenically-impacted environments offer the opportunity to discover novel microbial species and metabolisms, which may be undetectable in natural systems. Here, a combined metagenomic and geochemical study in Base Mine Lake, Alberta, Canada, which is the only oil sands end pit lake to date, revealed that nitrification was performed by members from Nitrosomonadaceae, Chloroflexi and unclassified Gammaproteobacteria "MBAE14." While Nitrosomonadaceae and Chloroflexi groups were relatively abundant in the upper oxygenated zones, MBAE14 dominated the hypoxic hypolimnetic zones (approximately 30% of total microbial communities); MBAE14 was not detected in the underlying anoxic tailings. Replication rate analyses indicate that MBAE14 grew in metalimnetic and hypolimnetic water cap regions, most actively at the metalimnetic, ammonia/oxygen transition zone consistent with it putatively conducting nitrification. Detailed genomic analyses of MBAE14 evidenced both ammonia oxidation and denitrification into dinitrogen capabilities. However, the absence of known CO 2 -fixation genes suggests a heterotrophic denitrifying metabolism. Functional marker genes of ammonia oxidation ( amo and hao ) in the MBAE14 genome are homologous with those conserved in autotrophic nitrifiers, but not with those of known heterotrophic nitrifiers. We propose that this novel MBAE14 inhabits the specific ammonia-rich, oxygen and labile organic matter-limited conditions occurring in Base Mine Lake which selectively favors mixotrophic coupled nitrifier denitrification metabolism. Our results highlight the opportunities to better constrain biogeochemical cycles from the application of metagenomics to engineered systems associated with extractive resource sectors.

The reasons for these differences are unclear since both lesions similarly alter the Watson-Crick binding face of T. To rationalize these replication outcomes at a molecular level, this work uses density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to probe the lesion base-pairing properties as well as lesion accommodation by human polymerase Î· (pol Î·) and post-extension DNA duplexes. O4-Me-T forms two strong hydrogen bonds with an opposing G in the active site of pol Î·, which rationalizes the observed lesion mutagenicity. Nevertheless, dATP insertion opposite O4-Me-T can proceed through water-mediated hydrogen bonding, which is similar to the pathway previously proposed for pol Î· bypass of abasic sites and other T alkylation lesions. In contrast, the position of O2-Me-T in the pol Î· active site is dynamic due to the presence of the aberrant methyl group on the minor groove side of DNA. In fact, the experimental replication outcomes can only be rationalized when the syn glycosidic orientation of O2-Me-T is considered, which stabilizes the pre-insertion complex by placing the damage in the polymerase open pocket on the major groove side of DNA. Although dATP insertion can occur opposite syn -O2-Me-T through a water-mediated pathway similar to O4-Me-T replication, rotation about the glycosidic bond precludes a stable pol Î· ternary complex corresponding to dGTP insertion, which correlates with the reported nonmutagenic bypass of O2-Me-T. In addition to providing structural insights into the differential mutagenicity of methylated T adducts, our data highlight an emerging theme in the literature for the replication of pyrimidine alkylation products in noncanonical glycosidic orientations and sets the stage for future work on the replication of other alkylated lesions by TLS polymerases.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31446753&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aung, Nay</author><author>Vargas, Jose D</author><author>Yang, Chaojie</author><author>Cabrera, Claudia P</author><author>Warren, Helen R</author><author>Fung, Kenneth</author><author>Tzanis, Evan</author><author>Barnes, Michael R</author><author>Rotter, Jerome I</author><author>Taylor, Kent D</author><author>Manichaikul, Ani W</author><author>Lima, Joao A C</author><author>Bluemke, David A</author><author>Piechnik, Stefan K</author><author>Neubauer, Stefan</author><author>Munroe, Patricia B</author><author>Petersen, Steffen E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-Wide Analysis of Left Ventricular Image-Derived Phenotypes Identifies Fourteen Loci Associated With Cardiac Morphogenesis and Heart Failure Development.</title><secondary-title>Circulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation</full-title><abbr-1>Circulation</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1318-1330</pages><volume>140</volume><number>16</number><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Loci</keyword><keyword>genome-wide association study</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study*</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>heart failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure/*pathology</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure/genetics</keyword><keyword>Heart Ventricles/*diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>Heart/*growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>left ventricle</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Morphogenesis/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Ventricular Function, Left</keyword><keyword>Ventricular Remodeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-10-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1524-4539</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041161</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The genetic basis of left ventricular (LV) image-derived phenotypes, which play a vital role in the diagnosis, management, and risk stratification of cardiovascular diseases, is unclear at present.; Methods: The LV parameters were measured from the cardiovascular magnetic resonance studies of the UK Biobank. Genotyping was done using Affymetrix arrays, augmented by imputation. We performed genome-wide association studies of 6 LV traits-LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, LV stroke volume, LV ejection fraction, LV mass, and LV mass to end-diastolic volume ratio. The replication analysis was performed in the MESA study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). We identified the candidate genes at genome-wide significant loci based on the evidence from extensive bioinformatic analyses. Polygenic risk scores were constructed from the summary statistics of LV genome-wide association studies to predict the heart failure events.; Results: The study comprised 16â923 European UK Biobank participants (mean age 62.5 years; 45.8% men) without prevalent myocardial infarction or heart failure. We discovered 14 genome-wide significant loci (3 loci each for LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, and LV mass to end-diastolic volume ratio; 4 loci for LV ejection fraction, and 1 locus for LV mass) at a stringent P &lt;1Ã10 -8 . Three loci were replicated at Bonferroni significance and 7 loci at nominal significance ( P &lt;0.05 with concordant direction of effect) in the MESA study (n=4383). Follow-up bioinformatic analyses identified 28 candidate genes that were enriched in the cardiac developmental pathways and regulation of the LV contractile mechanism. Eight genes ( TTN, BAG3, GRK5, HSPB7, MTSS1, ALPK3, NMB , and MMP11 ) supported by at least 2 independent lines of in silico evidence were implicated in the cardiac morphogenesis and heart failure development. The polygenic risk scores of LV phenotypes were predictive of heart failure in a holdout UK Biobank sample of 3106 cases and 224â134 controls (odds ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.26 - 1.58, for the top quintile versus the bottom quintile of the LV end-systolic volume risk score).; Conclusions: We report 14 genetic loci and indicate several candidate genes that not only enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of prognostically important LV phenotypes but also shed light on potential novel therapeutic targets for LV remodeling.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31554410&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McManus, Emma</author><author>Turner, David</author><author>Gray, Ewan</author><author>Khawar, Haseeb</author><author>Okoli, Toochukwu</author><author>Sach, Tracey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Barriers and Facilitators to Model Replication Within Health Economics.</title><secondary-title>Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research</full-title><abbr-1>Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1018-1025</pages><volume>22</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Cost-Benefit Analysis</keyword><keyword>Decision Making*</keyword><keyword>decision-analytic modeling</keyword><keyword>Economics, Medical*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Models, Economic*</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword><keyword>reporting transparency</keyword><keyword>reproducibility</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1524-4733</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jval.2019.04.1928</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Model replication is important because it enables researchers to check research integrity and transparency and, potentially, to inform the model conceptualization process when developing a new or updated model.; Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the replicability of published decision analytic models and to identify the barriers and facilitators to replication.; Methods: Replication attempts of 5 published economic modeling studies were made. The replications were conducted using only publicly available information within the manuscripts and supplementary materials. The replicator attempted to reproduce the key results detailed in the paper, for example, the total cost, total outcomes, and if applicable, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio reported. Although a replication attempt was not explicitly defined as a success or failure, the replicated results were compared for percentage difference to the original results.; Results: In conducting the replication attempts, common barriers and facilitators emerged. For most case studies, the replicator needed to make additional assumptions when recreating the model. This was often exacerbated by conflicting information being presented in the text and the tables. Across the case studies, the variation between original and replicated results ranged fromÂ -4.54% to 108.00% for costs andÂ -3.81% to 0.40% for outcomes.; Conclusion: This study demonstrates that although models may appear to be comprehensively reported, it is often not enough to facilitate a precise replication. Further work is needed to understand how to improve model transparency and in turn increase the chances of replication, thus ensuring future usability.

At present, little is known about the defense mechanisms of the PWN, which limits PWD control. Although autophagy plays an important role in the physiological and pathological processes of eukaryotes, its significance in the PWN remains unknown. In this study, we prepared an anti-BxATG8 polyclonal antibody and identified two PWN autophagy marker proteins: BxATG8-I and BxATG8-II. By western blot analysis, we found that the ratio of BxATG8-II to BxATG8-I, which represents autophagic activity, was decreased significantly when samples were treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. As such, we were able to successfully detect and quantify autophagic activity in the PWN. Thereafter, we investigated the effects of low and high temperatures on PWN growth and reproduction. The results revealed that feeding rate, reproduction rate, and mobility decreased at 15Â°C and increased at 35Â°C. By contrast, autophagic activity was high at 15Â°C and low at 35Â°C, suggesting that the PWN regulates autophagic activity in response to changes in temperature to maintain physiological homeostasis. When autophagy was inhibited at 15Â°C, feeding rate, reproductive rate, and mobility declined further, indicating that autophagy is crucial for PWN growth and reproduction at low temperature. These results indicate that autophagy in the PWN is an important response mechanism to temperature changes. (Â© The Author(s) 2019.

A single experiment may be linked to hundreds of data acquisitions, which are frequently stored in proprietary file formats. Together with community-, repository-, as well as publisher-specific reporting standards, this state of affairs frequently leads to manual -and thus error prone-metadata extraction and formatting. Data extracted from a single file also often stand in for an entire file set, implying a risk for unreported parameter divergence. To support quality control and data reporting, the C# application MARMoSET extracts and reduces publication relevant metadata from Thermo Fischer Scientific RAW files. It is integrated with an R package for easy reporting. The tool is expected to be particularly useful to high throughput environments such as service facilities with large project numbers and/or sizes.

We evaluated a new obstetric quality of recovery score (ObsQoR-11, initially formulated for elective CD) following non-elective CD.; Methods: ObsQoR-11 questionnaires were completed by women at day one post non-elective CD. Convergent validity was assessed by correlation of ObsQoR-11 with a 100â¯mm numerical rating scale (NRS) of general health status; discriminant validity by correlation with good vs poor recovery (NRS of â¥70 vs 0.15; split-half reliability 0.96; and intra-class correlation &gt;0.6; no floor or ceiling effects. One hundred percent completed the ObsQoR-11 (median [IQR] completion time 117 [89-156] s).; Conclusions: ObsQoR-11 is valid and reliable in assessing recovery after non-elective CD. Further research should assess generalisability and use following vaginal delivery. (Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We describe a provider-focused care model to reduce unwarranted or unwanted acute health care utilization.; Objective: Assess the capability of the Reducing Avoidable Facility Transfers (RAFT) model to reduce unwanted and unwarranted acute health care utilization among residents in 3 rural SNFs between January 1, 2016 and June 30,Â 2017.; Design: Prospective cohort, pre/post study.; Setting: Three rural SNFs in collaboration with a geriatric practice in a tertiary academic medical center.; Participants: Post-acute care (PAC) and long-term care (LTC) residents of 3 rural SNFs.; Intervention: RAFT includes the following components: (1) a small team of providers who manage longitudinal care and after hours call; (2) elicitation of advance care plans and preferences regarding acute care; (3) standardized communication process engaging the provider at the identification of an acute care event; (4) a biweekly case review of all emergency department (ED) transfers.; Measures: ED and hospital utilization.; Results: RAFT demonstrated a 35% reduction in monthly ED transfers and a 30.5% reduction in monthly hospitalizations. These reductions were greatest for LTC residents.; Conclusions/implications: The RAFT approach substantially reduced unwarranted ED and hospital utilization in this study. Results support replication and evaluation in a larger, more diverse setting and population. (Copyright Â© 2019 AMDA â The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

Of the 9578 participants, 1150 accessed our questionnaire (12.0% access rate), 1053 completed at least 1 portion, and 904 completed the questionnaire in its entirety (85.8% completion rate). Of the participants, 60.1% (n = 569/947) were female, 66.6% (n = 632/949) held a master's degree, 39.3% (n = 414/1053) worked in a collegiate or university setting, and 36.1% (n = 381/1053) worked in a secondary school setting.; Main Outcome Measure(s): We used a 31-item questionnaire with demographics (12 items), medical documentation behaviors (16 items), barriers (2 items), and perceptions (1 multipart item) sections. The questionnaire explored athletic trainers' behaviors as well as confidence in, comfort with, and concerns about their documentation practices (Cronbach Î± = 0.887). We used descriptive statistics to identify characteristics of central tendency (mean, standard deviation, mode, frequency).; Results: Participants always (45.7%, n = 478/1046) or very frequently (39.0%, n = 408/1046) used a double documentation system consisting of electronic and paper records (50.4%, n = 523/1038). They most often documented to provide legal protection (86.8%, n = 914/1053), because it is a legal obligation (79.1%, n = 833/1053), or to track patient progress (83.9%, n = 883/1053). The most frequently cited barriers to medical documentation were time (76.5%, n = 806/1053), managing too many patients (51.9%, n = 547/1053), technological concerns (17.2%, n = 181/1053), and software limitations (17.2%, n = 181/1053). Respondents believed they were competent, comfortable, and confident in their documentation practices.; Conclusions: We were able to evaluate the generalizability of previous research while adding to the understanding of the behaviors toward, barriers to, and perceptions about medical documentation. We confirmed that time and patient load affected the ability to perform high-quality medical documentation.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31386576&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foxx, Richard M.</author><author>Faw, Gerald D.</author><author>Nisbeth, Irene</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social skills training for inpatient emotionally disturbed children: An analysis of generalization</title><secondary-title>Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy</full-title><abbr-1>Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy</abbr-1></periodical><pages>11-37</pages><volume>12</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Emotional Disturbances</keyword><keyword>emotionally disturbed 9â14 yr old males</keyword><keyword>generalization</keyword><keyword>Generalization (Learning)</keyword><keyword>social skills training</keyword><keyword>Social Skills Training</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0731-7107</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1300/J019v12n04_02</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Assessed the generalization of social skills in a training program for 6 emotionally disturbed boys (aged 9â14 yrs) who were inpatients.

Method: Undergraduate participants played a computer game requiring them to learn which stimuli (beans) would increase/decrease their points. Later, participants classified the valence of game beans and novel ones varying in resemblance to game beans. The weighting bias in attitude generalization was estimated as the average response to novel beans, controlling for game bean learning. We examined whether this bias related to judgments of hypothetical situations concerning interpersonal relationships (Study 1), threat assessment (Study 2), risk propensities (Study 3), and risk behavior (Study 6).We also assessed whether valence weighting is specifically predictive of novel situations (Studies 4 and 5). Finally,we explored participantsâ ability to self-report their weighting bias (Study 7). Results: Valence weighting in attitude generalization was related to judgments of novel situations and risk behavior. The performance-based measure did not correlate with responses to various questionnaires related to valence weighting. Conclusions: There is a fundamental individual difference associated with valence weighting, resulting in the relation between two processes unrelated in content, but sharing the essential characteristic of valence weightingâattitude generalization and evaluation of novel situations.

Trained adult male rats performed a discrete trial, go/no-go procedure, touching a bar in the presence of an S+ odor for water reward. Series of stimuli composed of different levels of adulteration of the S+ stimulus with generalization stimuli were created. With these stimuli, Ss produced graded levels of responding, allowing comparisons of similarity among odorant stimuli. The methodological advantage of this technique is seen in the inverse relationship between adulteration level and response latency. This technique can be applied to other types of odorant stimuli and should be of use for studying odorant perception or characteristics.

The purpose of this study was to assess reliability and construct validity of measures of condom attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy across 3,989 youth. Data were collected at computer kiosks and on the Internet. Analyses included internal consistency reliability assessments and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of three constructs in a 32-item a priori instrument. Reliability estimates ranged between 0.68 and 0.89, and goodness of fit indices all exceeded 0.90. Factor analysis results supported the compatibility of the items from the three subscales with their conceptual domains. Final scales include measures of positive and negative outcome expectancies related to condom use, peer and partner condom norms, self-efficacy for condom negotiation, and self-efficacy for condom use. These measures of condom attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy can be employed for assessments to improve standardization of measures and generalizability of research, particularly related to HIV prevention.

However, these studies have not reached the same conclusions in regard to the presence, spatial distribution (focal/diffuse), and directionality (elevated/reduced) of FA differences outside of the left perisylvian region. In addition, supplemental DTI measures (axial and radial diffusivities, diffusion trace) have yet to be utilized to examine the potential etiology of these FA reductions. Therefore, the present study sought to reexamine earlier findings through a sex- and age-controlled replication analysis and then to extend these findings with the aforementioned non-FA measures. The replication analysis showed that robust FA reductions in PSs were largely focal, left hemispheric, and within late-myelinating associative and commissural fibers (division III of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, callosal body, forceps minor of the corpus callosum). Additional DTI measures revealed that these FA reductions were attributable to an increase in diffusion perpendicular to the affected fiber tracts (elevated radial diffusivity). These findings suggest a hypothesis that will be testable in future studies: that myelogenesis may be abnormal in PSs within left-hemispheric fiber tracts that begin a prolonged course of myelination in the first postnatal year.

Cell labeling with division-sensitive markers and competitive transplantation studies have been used to estimate the replication rate of murine HSCs in vivo. However, these methods are not feasible in humans and surrogate assays are required. In this report, we analyze the changing ratio with age of maternal/paternal X-chromosome phenotypes in blood cells from females and infer that human HSCs replicate on average once every 40 weeks (range, 25-50 weeks). We then confirm this estimate with 2 independent approaches, use the estimate to simulate human hematopoiesis, and show that the simulations accurately reproduce marrow transplantation data. Our simulations also provide evidence that the number of human HSCs increases from birth until adolescence and then plateaus, and that the ratio of contributing to quiescent HSCs in humans significantly differs from mouse. In addition, they suggest that human marrow failure, such as the marrow failure that occurs after umbilical cord blood transplantation and with aplastic anemia, results from insufficient numbers of early progenitor cells, and not the absence of HSCs.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21343613&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoertel, Nicolas</author><author>Le Strat, Yann</author><author>De Maricourt, Pierre</author><author>Limosin, FrÃ©dÃ©ric</author><author>Dubertret, Caroline</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Are subjects in treatment trials of panic disorder representative of patients in routine clinical practice?

The present study sought to quantify the generalizability of clinical trialsâ results of individuals with DSM-IV panic disorder (PD) to a large community sample. Methods: Data were derived from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a large national representative sample of 43,093 adults of the United States population. We applied a standard set of eligibility criteria representative of PD clinical trials to all adults with past 12 months PD (n = 907), and then to a subgroup of participants seeking treatment (n = 105). Our aim was to determine the proportion of participants with PD who would have been excluded by typical eligibility criteria. Results: We found that more than 8 out of ten participants (80.52%; 95% CI = 77.13â83.52%) with PD were excluded by at least one criterion. In the subgroup of participants who sought treatment, the exclusion rate by at least one criterion was higher (92.40%; 95% CI = 84.60â96.42%). For the full sample and the treatment-seeking subsample, having currently a depression and a diagnosis of alcohol or drug abuse/dependence were the criteria excluding the highest percentage of participants. Having a lifetime history of bipolar disorder and a current significant medical condition also excluded a substantial proportion of individuals in both samples. Exclusion rates were similar when considering panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. Conclusions: Clinical trials, that exclude a majority of adults with panic disorder, should carefully consider the impact of eligibility criteria on the generalizability of their results. As required by CONSORT guidelines, reporting exclusion rate estimate and reasons of eligibility should be mandatory in both clinical trials and meta-analyses.

Method: The authors used a multiple-baseline, across-behaviors and -participants design to examine the effectiveness of a therapy program based on behavioral principles and methods to improve the production of target speech sounds in 3 adults with cochlear implants. The authors included probe items in a baseline protocol to assess generalization of target speech sounds to untrained exemplars. Pretest and posttest scores from the Arizona Articulation Proficiency Scale, Third Revision (Arizonaâ3; Fudala, 2000) and measurement of speech errors during spontaneous speech were compared, providing additional measures of target behavior generalization. Results: The results of this study provided preliminary evidence supporting the overall effectiveness and efficiency of a behavioral speech therapy program in increasing percent correct speech sound production in adult cochlear implant recipients. The generalization of newly trained speech skills to untrained words and to spontaneous speech was demonstrated. Conclusion: These preliminary findings support the application of behavioral speech therapy techniques for training speech sound production in adults with cochlear implants. Implications for future research and the development of aural rehabilitation programs for adult cochlear implant recipients are discussed.

The present post hoc study sought to quantify the generalizability of clinical trial results in individuals with DSM-IV bipolar disorder to a large representative community sample. Method: Data were derived from the 2001â2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a large, nationally representative sample of 43,093 adults from the United States population. We applied a standard set of eligibility criteria representative of clinical trials to all adults with DSM-IV bipolar depression (n=785) or mania (n=724) in the past 12 months and then to a subsample of participants seeking treatment for bipolar depression (n=276). Our aim was to determine the proportion of participants with bipolar depression or acute mania who would have been excluded from a clinical trial by typical eligibility criteria. Results: We found that more than 5 of 10 participants with bipolar depression (58.17%) or mania (55.75%) would have been excluded by at least 1 eligibility criterion. In the subgroup of participants with bipolar depression who sought treatment, the exclusion rate by at least 1 criterion was higher (63.87%). Having a significant risk of suicide was the criterion excluding the highest percentage of participants in the bipolar depression samples, while having a current DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence was the one leading to the greatest exclusion rate in clinical trials for participants with acute mania. Exclusion rates were higher for participants with bipolar I depression compared with those with bipolar II depression. Conclusions: Traditional clinical trials tend to exclude a majority of individuals with bipolar disorder. Clinical trials should carefully consider the impact of eligibility criteria on the generalizability of their results and explain the rationale for their use. Future trials should weigh the trade-offs between internal validity and the representativeness of the study.

Ten studies of FCT and generalization were identified, analyzed, and summarized using the framework provided by Stokes and Osnes (Behavior Therapist 20:337â355, 1989) that detailed principles and tactics programming generalization. In addition to the tactic of recruiting natural consequences which is inherent to FCT, several studies evaluated additional strategies for programming generalization during FCT including modification of maladaptive consequences, reinforcement of occurrences of generalization, training sufficient stimulus exemplars, programming common physical stimuli, and programming common social stimuli. The results of these studies suggest that a) FCT and the tactic of recruiting natural consequences is sometimes sufficient to produce generalization but not in every case, and b) generalization of the treatment effects of FCT can be enhanced through the use of specific tactics for programming generalization. Overall, the results of this review suggest that a relatively small number of studies of FCT have systematically evaluated generalization. Thus, future research should continue to evaluate specific strategies for programming generalization with FCT. This includes combining procedures such as recruiting natural consequences with other strategies outlined by Stokes and Osnes.

One topic receiving substantial attention is the role of replication in psychological science. Using the complete publication history of the 100 psychology journals with the highest 5-year impact factors, the current article provides an overview of replications in psychological research since 1900. This investigation revealed that roughly 1.6% of all psychology publications used the term replication in text. A more thorough analysis of 500 randomly selected articles revealed that only 68% of articles using the term replication were actual replications, resulting in an overall replication rate of 1.07%. Contrary to previous findings in other fields, this study found that the majority of replications in psychology journals reported similar findings to their original studies (i.e., they were successful replications). However, replications were significantly less likely to be successful when there was no overlap in authorship between the original and replicating articles. Moreover, despite numerous systemic biases, the rate at which replications are being published has increased in recent decades.

Rare mutations in homologs of evolutionarily conserved clock genes are found in select pedigrees with extreme sleep timing, and there is suggestive evidence that certain common polymorphisms may be associated with self-reported day/night preference. However, no common polymorphism has been associated with the timing of directly observed human behavioral rhythms or other physiological markers of circadian timing at the population level. Methods: We performed a candidate gene association study with replication, evaluating associations between polymorphisms in homologs of evolutionarily conserved clock genes and the timing of behavioral rhythms measured by actigraphy. For validated polymorphisms, we evaluated associations with transcript expression and time of death in additional cohorts. Results: rs7221412, a common polymorphism near period homolog 1 (PER1), was associated with the timing of activity rhythms in both the discovery and replication cohorts (joint p = 2.1 Ã 10â7). Mean activity timing was delayed by 67 minutes in rs7221412GG versus rs7221412AA homozygotes. rs7221412 also showed a suggestive time-dependent relationship with both cerebral cortex (p = 0.05) and CD14+CD16â monocyte (p = 0.02) PER1 expression and an interesting association with time of death (p = 0.015) in which rs7221412GG individuals had a mean time of death nearly 7 hours later than rs7221412AA/AG. Interpretation: A common polymorphism near PER1 is associated with the timing of human behavioral rhythms, and shows evidence of association with time of death. This may be mediated by differential PER1 expression. These results may facilitate individualized scheduling of shift work, medical treatments, or monitoring of vulnerable patient populations.

In order to determine whether this programme could be transferable to routine practice and thereby assess its generalizability, research has been carried out to quantify the health care benefits of incorporating the concept of IMM as routine clinical practice. Method: The IMM programme of care was delivered to all eligible patients (subject to inclusion criteria) across two hospital sites in Northern Ireland during normal pharmacy opening hours. All patients were followed up for a period of 12 months from their time of hospital admission. All patient data were collected using the custom-designed Electronic Pharmacist Intervention Clinical System at each stage of their hospital journey, that is, admission, inpatient stay and discharge. Results: Patients who received the IMM service benefited from a reduced length of hospital stay on their reference admission (1.42 days; P = 0.020) as well as a reduced length of stay during the first rehospitalization (5.86 days; P = 0.013). There was also a trend of a reduced number of readmissions and a longer time to readmission during the 12-month follow-up period. Potential significant opportunity cost savings were demonstrated as well as a significant improvement in medication appropriateness (discharge vs. reference admission). Conclusions: The IMM programme of care has proven to be transferable to routine hospital care within two hospitals in Northern Ireland. It is anticipated that this current research will further inform the development of IMM as routine clinical practice across Northern Ireland and beyond.

Finkel, Paul W. Eastwick and Harry T. Reis (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2017[Aug], Vol 113[2], 244-253). In the commentary, there was an error in the References list. The publishing year for the 18th article was cited incorrectly as 2016. The in-text acronym associated with this citation should read instead as LCL2017. The correct References list citation should read as follows: LeBel, E. P., Campbell, L., &amp; Loving, T. J. (2017). Benefits of open and high-powered research outweigh costs. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 113, 230â243. http://dx.doi.org/10 .1037/pspi0000049. The online version of this article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2017-30567-002[/rid].) Finkel, Eastwick, and Reis (2015; FER2015) argued that psychological science is better served by responding to apprehensions about replicability rates with contextualized solutions than with one-size-fits-all solutions. Here, we extend FER2015âs analysis to suggest that much of the discussion of best research practices since 2011 has focused on a single feature of high-quality scienceâreplicabilityâwith insufficient sensitivity to the implications of recommended practices for other features, like discovery, internal validity, external validity, construct validity, consequentiality, and cumulativeness. Thus, although recommendations for bolstering replicability have been innovative, compelling, and abundant, it is difficult to evaluate their impact on our science as a whole, especially because many research practices that are beneficial for some features of scientific quality are harmful for others. For example, FER2015 argued that bigger samples are generally better, but also noted that very large samples ('those larger than required for effect sizes to stabilize'; p. 291) could have the downside of commandeering resources that would have been better invested in other studies. In their critique of FER2015, LeBel, Campbell, and Loving (2016) concluded, based on simulated data, that ever-larger samples are better for the efficiency of scientific discovery (i.e., that there are no tradeoffs). As demonstrated here, however, this conclusion holds only when the replicatorâs resources are considered in isolation. If we widen the assumptions to include the original researcherâs resources as well, which is necessary if the goal is to consider resource investment for the field as a whole, the conclusion changes radicallyâand strongly supports a tradeoff-based analysis. In general, as psychologists seek to strengthen our science, we must complement our much-needed work on increasing replicability with careful attention to the other features of a high-quality science.

These factories form in the nucleus during S phase and are sites of DNA synthesis and high local concentrations of enzymes required for chromatin replication. Why these structures are required, and how they are organised internally has yet to be identified. It has been difficult to analyse the structure of these factories as they are small in size and thus below the resolution limit of the standard confocal microscope. We have used stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, which improves on the resolving power of the confocal microscope, to probe the structure of these factories at sub-diffraction limit resolution.; Results: Using immunofluorescent imaging of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and RPA (replication protein A) we show that factories are smaller in size (approximately 150 nm diameter), and greater in number (up to 1400 in an early S- phase nucleus), than is determined by confocal imaging. The replication inhibitor hydroxyurea caused an approximately 40% reduction in number and a 30% increase in diameter of replication factories, changes that were not clearly identified by standard confocal imaging.; Conclusions: These measurements for replication factory size now approach the dimensions suggested by electron microscopy. This agreement between these two methods, that use very different sample preparation and imaging conditions, suggests that we have arrived at a true measurement for the size of these structures. The number of individual factories present in a single nucleus that we measure using this system is greater than has been previously reported. This analysis therefore suggests that each replication factory contains fewer active replication forks than previously envisaged.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20015367&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Faggion, Clovis Mariano, Jr</author><author>Schmitter, Marc</author><author>Tu, Yu-Kang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of replication of research evidence from animals to humans in studies on peri-implantitis therapy.</title><secondary-title>Journal of dentistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of dentistry</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of dentistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>737-747</pages><volume>37</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Clinical Trials as Topic</keyword><keyword>Dental Implants/*adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Implants, Experimental/*adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Journal Impact Factor</keyword><keyword>Periodontitis/*etiology</keyword><keyword>Periodontitis/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Research Design</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1879-176X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jdent.2009.06.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Animal research is conducted to understand the causes and treatments of human diseases. Clinical human studies may not, however, be able to replicate results previously obtained from animal experiments.; Aim: to assess whether or not peri-implantitis therapies conducted in animal experiments were successfully replicated in human clinical trials.; Materials and Methods: Dental journals classified by citation impact factor were searched in the Journal Citation Reports database for animal trials on treatment of peri-implantitis between 1992 and 2008. It was assumed that prominent findings from high-ranked journals would be more likely to be tested in subsequent human clinical trials. A second literature search was conducted in the Pubmed, Cochrane, and Lilacs databases to identify potential human studies that repeated or replicated animal experiments. Controlled trials and case-series were included in the analysis. Because of the heterogeneity of the studies (e.g., different study designs and different outcome measures), only descriptive analysis was undertaken.; Results: Of 1199 studies retrieved, 53 (23 animal and 30 human studies) were selected for the review. Because no animal experiment and human trial had comparable study procedures, precise determination of the success of replication from animal experiments in clinical trials was not possible. Overall, the study characteristics were extremely heterogeneous.; Conclusions: To reduce the great heterogeneity between animal and human studies on peri-implantitis, researchers should pay attention to standardization of research procedures. Power analysis and sample-size calculation in animal experiments and human trials should be always considered when planning a research study.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19604613&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>BoÃ«lle, P Y</author><author>Bernillon, P</author><author>Desenclos, J C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A preliminary estimation of the reproduction ratio for new influenza A(H1N1) from the outbreak in Mexico, March-April 2009.</title><secondary-title>Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin</full-title><abbr-1>Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin</abbr-1></periodical><volume>14</volume><number>19</number><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>Disease Outbreaks*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/*isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Influenza, Human/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Influenza, Human/transmission</keyword><keyword>Mexico/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Population Surveillance</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-05-14</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1560-7917</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/ese.14.19.19205-en</electronic-resource-num><abstract>As of 12 May 2009, 5,251 cases of the new influenza A(H1N1) have been officially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 30 countries, with most of the identified cases exported from Mexico where a local epidemic has been going on for the last two months. Sustained human-to-human transmission is necessary to trigger influenza pandemic and estimating the reproduction ratio (average number of secondary cases per primary case) is necessary for forecasting the spread of infection. We use two methods to estimate the reproduction ratio from the epidemic curve in Mexico using three plausible generation intervals (the time between primary and secondary case infection). As expected, the reproduction ratio estimates were highly sensitive to assumptions regarding the generation interval, which remains to be estimated for the current epidemic. Here, we suggest that the reproduction ratio was less than 2.2 - 3.1 in Mexico, depending on the generation interval. Monitoring and updating the reproduction ratio estimate as the epidemic spreads outside Mexico into different settings should remain a priority for assessing the situation and helping to plan public health interventions.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19442402&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nwaru, Bright I.</author><author>Klemetti, Reija</author><author>Yuan, Shen</author><author>Kun, Huang</author><author>Wang, Yang</author><author>Hemminki, Elina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Completeness and utility of interview data from proxy respondents in prenatal care research in rural China</title><secondary-title>Maternal and Child Health Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Maternal and Child Health Journal</full-title><abbr-1>Maternal and Child Health Journal</abbr-1></periodical><pages>867-876</pages><volume>16</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>completeness</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>gestational age</keyword><keyword>Health Care Surveys</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>interview data</keyword><keyword>Interviews</keyword><keyword>Interviews as Topic</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Mothers</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy Outcome</keyword><keyword>pregnancy outcomes</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy Outcomes</keyword><keyword>Prenatal Care</keyword><keyword>prenatal care research</keyword><keyword>Proxy</keyword><keyword>proxy respondents</keyword><keyword>Response Parameters</keyword><keyword>rural China</keyword><keyword>Rural Environments</keyword><keyword>Rural Population</keyword><keyword>Statistics, Nonparametric</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>utility</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1092-7875</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10995-011-0810-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In household surveys, the use of data provided by relatives can increase response rates and generalisability of research findings. This study assessed the quality of data from relatives and the impact of the data source on the association between the use of prenatal care and pregnancy outcomes. Data for 3,673 new mothers and 293 proxy respondents were available from a house-hold survey in 2008â2009 in rural China. Analyses were performed using chi-square test, ANOVA, KruskalâWallis test, and logistic regression models. Differences in the studied variables were small, but proxy respondents were slightly more likely to have missing data than the new mothers. Differences and missing data were more common for the use of prenatal care and outcome variables (mode of delivery, place of delivery, birth weight, use of postnatal care, and gestational age at birth) than for the background characteristics of the participants. Husbandsâ reports were closer to the index reports than that of the other proxies. The associations between the exposures and outcomes were mostly similar between the proxy and index respondents. Relatives can be interviewed instead of women to study prenatal care without a substantial negative impact on study results. Studies using proxy respondents should stratify the analysis by type of respondents.

However, there exist few reliable and comprehensive measures that assess aged care staffs' knowledge about late life depression. The Knowledge of Late-Life Depression Scale is one such scale. In this study we modified this measure in an attempt to improve its psychometric properties so that it can be used with confidence in research and practise. Our modifications to the original measure resulted in the Knowledge of Late-Life Depression ScaleâRevised. Method: Aged care staff (N = 149) from 20 low level care facilities and community care facilities in Melbourne, Australia, completed the Knowledge of Late-Life Depression ScaleâRevised. Results:Using Confirmatory Factor Analysis and reliability analysis, the Knowledge of Late-Life Depression ScaleâRevised was found to demonstrate three robust and internally consistent factors. These factors were: symptoms of depression, facts about depression, and myths of depression. The revised measure was found to yield superior psychometric properties compared to the original measure. Limitations: Replication studies are required, especially with other aged carer samples to ensure that the factor structure and internal consistency of the measure are supported across different aged care contexts in Australia and elsewhere. Conclusions: The Knowledge of Late-Life DepressionâRevised is a measure that can be used by researchers and agencies to assess the knowledge of depression among professional care staff. The measure is expected to be especially useful as an assessment tool for training and educational purposes.

While duration reproduction of the non-percussionists showed a characteristic central tendency or regression to the mean, drummers responded veridically. Furthermore, when the stimuli were auditory tones rather than flashes, all subjects responded veridically. The behavior of all three groups in both modalities is well explained by a Bayesian model that seeks to minimize reproduction errors by incorporating a central tendency prior, a probability density function centered at the mean duration of the sample. We measured separately temporal precision thresholds with a bisection task; thresholds were twice as low in drummers as in the other two groups. These estimates of temporal precision, together with an adaptable Bayesian prior, predict well the reproduction results and the central tendency strategy under all conditions and for all subject groups. These results highlight the efficiency and flexibility of sensorimotor mechanisms estimating temporal duration.

Subjects and setting: The subjects consisted of 921 15-year-old Czech pupils (508 girls and 413 boys). The data, extracted from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children International data archive, were collected using structured questionnaire in school environment. Statistical analysis: Relations among variables based on an estimate of the asymptotic sampling covariance matrix of the polychoric sample correlations, were analyzed by structural equation modeling using Generally Weighted Least Square iterative procedure. Results: Analysis of data using SEM brought acceptable support for the proposed model assuming effect of emotional support and family cohesion on the relationships among life satisfaction, somatic/psychic problems and adaptation to school environment. Model accounted for 31% and 35% of variance of boys and girls life satisfaction, respectively. The magnitude of congruence between the model and the data was noteworthy. Indices reflect that the model fits well and was also, apart from interfactor correlations and notably from error variances, gender invariant. Standardized effects of emotional support and family cohesion on the life satisfaction, and family cohesion on adaptation to school environment were very similar and statistically significant for both groups. Nevertheless, it seems that life satisfaction of girls is noticeably more strongly associated with the degree of perceived emotional support, and also their adaptation to school environment could be more potent source of .somatic/ psychic problem in comparison to boys. Study limitation: Structural equation models are essentially correlational in nature. Consequently, even with adequate fit indices and the explanation of a large proportion of variance in the criterion construct, other models could be equally viable. The present study is subject to several limitations. First, the findings require replication with an independent sample. Second, because the data relied on self-report measures, replication studies that include third-party observations of the participants' behavior would be desirable.

The telomere replication fork proceeds unidirectionally from the last subtelomeric origin towards the end of the chromosome, replicating the 5'-3' G-rich strand by lagging mechanisms and the complementary C-rich strand by leading mechanisms. It has been proposed that the G-rich nature of telomeres may favor the formation of secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes during replication and that specific mechanisms must prevent this to allow the fork to progress unimpeded. The potential of G-quadruplex formation by telomeric sequences has been clearly demonstrated in vitro but it is not known whether these structures form in vivo. We tested the effect of a potent and specific G-quadruplex ligand, telomestatin (TMS), on telomere replication using a novel quantitative approach applied to CO-FISH. We show that TMS, although it penetrates and persists within cells, does not affect telomere replication after short or long-term treatments of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. It does however affect the hybridization efficiency of FISH telomeric probes that recognize the G-rich strand. Our work illustrates the use of a novel technique to measure telomere replication efficiency and suggests that G-quadruplex ligands do not affect telomere replication in a non tumoral context.

Three children (all males) participated in the study. In a multi-element design children with ASD were trained to tact situation-based emotions (i.e., 'happy', 'sad', 'angry', and 'afraid') using novel video based scenarios. To increase the likelihood that each child would learn a generalized repertoire of emotion understanding, multiple exemplars of emotion identification were trained using a multi-component procedure. The results indicated significant increases in tacting situation-based emotions. To evaluate the generalization of training, novel video stories were employed that depicted the trained emotions. The findings indicated generalization of situation- based emotional tacting to the novel video stories.

We examined reproductive success and recruitment at the individual and population levels in Swainson's Hawks breeding in northern California. At the population level, we investigated whether the number of individuals subsequently recruited could be predicted by the number of offspring produced in any given year, finding no evidence of differences in probability of recruitment by cohort or year Instead, age of recruits was the best predictor of probability of their being recruited into the local breeding population. At the individual level, we used generalized linear models to examine the correlation between lifetime reproductive success of individual females and the number of their offspring recruited. For individuals, the number of fledglings produced was significantly correlated with both the number of those offspring and of grandchildren recruited into the breeding population. We also examined the relationship between the average annual reproduction of an individual and the number of offspring recruited, finding these significantly correlated. The relationship was not linear: individuals producing moderate numbers of fledglings, on average, yielded the highest numbers of recruits, reflecting a trade-off between adult survival and reproduction. These results provide evidence that monitoring of reproductive success of individuals or a population can give reasonable indices of future recruitment if the study is continued for a long period.

The eXiTCBR framework is proposed to support the development of and experimentation with new case-based reasoning (CBR) systems for medical diagnosis. Method: Our framework offers a modular, heterogeneous environment that combines different CBR techniques for different application requirements. The graphical user interface allows easy navigation through a set of experiments that are pre-visualized as plots (receiver operator characteristics (ROC) and accuracy curves). This user-friendly navigation allows easy analysis and replication of experiments. Used as a plug-in on the same interface, eXiTCBR can work with any data mining technique such as determining feature relevance. Results: The results show that eXiTCBR is a user-friendly tool that facilitates medical users to utilize CBR methods to determine diagnoses in the field of breast cancer, dealing with different patterns implicit in the data. Conclusions: Although several tools have been developed to facilitate the rapid construction of prototypes, none of them has taken into account the particularities of medical applications as an appropriate interface to medical users. eXiTCBR aims to fill this gap. It uses CBR methods and common medical visualization tools, such as ROC plots, that facilitate the interpretation of the results. The navigation capabilities of this tool allow the tuning of different CBR parameters using experimental results. In addition, the tool allows experiment reproducibility.

Similarly, plasma viral loads are lower in HIV-2 infection, suggesting that HIV-2 replication is restricted in vivo in comparison to that of HIV-1. However, to date, in vivo studies characterizing replication intermediates in the viral life cycle of HIV-2 have been limited. In order to test the hypothesis that HIV-2 has a lower replication rate in vivo than HIV-1 does, we quantified total viral DNA, integrated proviral DNA, cell-associated viral mRNA, and plasma viral loads in peripheral blood samples from groups of therapy-naÃ¯ve HIV-1-infected (n = 21) and HIV-2-infected (n = 18) individuals from Dakar, Senegal, with CD4(+) T-cell counts of &gt;200/microl. Consistent with our previous findings, total viral DNA loads were similar between HIV-1 and HIV-2 and plasma viral loads were higher among HIV-1-infected individuals. Proportions of DNA in the integrated form were also similar between these viruses. In contrast, levels of viral mRNA were lower in HIV-2 infection. Our study indicates that HIV-2 is able to establish a stable, integrated proviral infection in vivo, but that accumulation of viral mRNA is attenuated in HIV-2 infection relative to that in HIV-1 infection. The differences in viral mRNA are consistent with the differences in plasma viral loads between HIV-1 and HIV-2 and suggest that lower plasma viral loads, and possibly the attenuated pathogenesis of HIV-2, can be explained by lower rates of viral replication in vivo.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17329334&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Brian D.</author><author>Van Wingerden, Sigrid</author><author>Nieuwbeerta, Paul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sentencing homicide offenders in the Netherlands: Offender, victim, and situational influences in criminal punishment</title><secondary-title>Criminology: An Interdisciplinary Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Criminology: An Interdisciplinary Journal</full-title><abbr-1>Criminology: An Interdisciplinary Journal</abbr-1></periodical><pages>981-1018</pages><volume>48</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adjudication</keyword><keyword>Criminal Offenders</keyword><keyword>criminal punishment</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>Homicide</keyword><keyword>homicide offenders</keyword><keyword>Human Sex Differences</keyword><keyword>Punishment</keyword><keyword>sentencing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0011-1384</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00210.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Empirical investigations of criminal sentencing represent a vast research enterprise in criminology. However, this research has been restricted almost exclusively to U.S. contexts, and often it suffers from key data limitations. As such, an examination of more detailed international sentencing data provides an important opportunity to assess the generalizability of contemporary research and theorizing on criminal punishment in the United States. The current study investigates little-researched questions about the influence of prosecutorial sentencing recommendations, victim/offender relationships, and extralegal disparities in sentencing by analyzing unique data on the punishment of homicide offenders in the Netherlands. The results indicate that offender, victim, and situational offense characteristics all exert important independent effects at sentencing and that prosecutorial recommendations exert powerful influences over judicial sentences. The article concludes with a discussion of future directions for comparative sentencing research across international contexts.

We recently showed that visuomotor adaptation requiring modulation of the activity of the same muscles is more efficient than adaptation requiring a transition to different muscles. Here I specifically tested for adaptation at the level of the final transformation into muscle activation by assessing generalization to unpracticed areas of the workspace, and propose a computational model with modulation of muscle synergies. In the experiment, a visuomotor rotation was applied during a center- out isometric torque production task carefully configured such that adaptation and generalization could be achieved either by only rescaling the contribution of the same muscles, or by additionally requiring the recruitment of different muscles. Consistent with our previous finding, the time course of directional errors revealed that the degree of adaptation was substantially lower (by 28.1%) for the latter case. More importantly, directional error obtained for generalization that required, in principle, to recruit different muscles from these implicated in the adaptation was more than twice that of other generalization areas. Taken together, these results suggest that modulation within an original muscle synergy contributed to visuomotor adaptation, and that synergy recomposition imposed a limitation on both adaptation and generalization. I reproduced these results with a model of the sensorimotor transformation which includes two population codes, one for the sensory network and one for the motor network. Muscle synergies are defined as linear combination of muscles by connections of the motor network, and modulation of these synergies are elicited by adaptation of the weight of these connections. Finally, I speculate that the limitation imposed on synergy recomposition originates in the balance of inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms that operate at different levels of the nervous system, and that contribute to the functional organization of muscle recruitment by focusing activity on relevant muscles.

Trait profiles also showed cross-study agreement within most cultures, 8 of which had not previously been studied. Multidimensional scaling showed that Western and non-Western cultures clustered along a dimension related to Extraversion. A culture-level factor analysis replicated earlier findings of a broad Extraversion factor but generally resembled the factor structure found in individuals.

Methods: We used principal factor analysis to describe inter-relationships between a large set of Geographic Information System-derived built and socioeconomic environment measures for adolescents in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Wave I, 1995-96, n = 17,294). Using resulting factors in sex-stratified multivariate negative binomial regression models, we tested for confounding of associations between built and socioeconomic environment characteristics and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Finally, we used knowledge gained from factor analysis to construct replicable environmental measures that account for interrelationships and avoid collinearity. Results: Using factor analysis, we identified three built environment constructs [(1) homogenous landscape; 2) development intensity with high pay facility count; 3) development intensity with high public facility count] and two socioeconomic environment constructs [1) advantageous economic environment, 2) disadvantageous social environment]. In regression analysis, confounding of built environment-MVPA associations by socioeconomic environment factors was stronger than among built environment factors. In fully adjusted models, MVPA was negatively associated with the highest (versus lowest) quartile of homogenous land cover in males [exp(coeff ) (95% CI): 0.91 (0.86, 0.96)] and intensity (pay facilities) [exp(coeff) (95% CI): 0.92 (0.85, 0.99)] in females. Single proxy measures (Simpson's diversity index, count of pay facilities, count of public facilities, median household income, and crime rate) representing each environmental construct replicated associations with MVPA. Conclusions: Environmental characteristics are inter-related. Both built and SES environments should be incorporated into analysis in order to minimize confounding. Single environmental measures may be useful proxies for environmental constructs in longitudinal analysis and replication in external populations, but more research is needed to better understand mechanisms of action, and ultimately identify policy-relevant environmental determinants of physical activity.

This qualitative replication study evaluated the differential effect of pop-up messages compared to static signs and the content of messages on EGMs on recall, thoughts, and behaviors assessed during the session and at 2-week follow-up. In Study 1, 127 regular EGM gamblers (male = 97, mean age = 20.3) recruited from a university student population attended a laboratory where they were randomly assigned to play a computer-based simulated EGM analogue displaying signs that differed by (a) mode of presentation (pop-up and static) and (b) message content (informative, self-appraisal, and control/blank). In Study 2, an identical methodology was used but included the use of a simulated EGM within an in vivo gaming setting with 124 regular EGM players (male = 81, mean age = 44.1). Results from both studies showed that pop-up messages were recalled more effectively than static messages immediately and at 2-week follow-up. Pop-up messages reportedly had a significantly greater impact on within-session thoughts and behaviors. Messages encouraging self-appraisal resulted in significantly greater effect on self-reported thoughts and behaviors during both the experimental session and in subsequent EGM play. These findings support the effectiveness of pop-up messages containing self-appraisal messages as an appropriate harm-minimization initiative.

However, dynamics of HEV levels in the stool and serum during clinical and subclinical infections have not been determined. A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay, using SYBR Green I in a LightCycler, was developed and optimized to allow quantification of HEV RNA in the stool and serum of both genotype 1 and 2 isolates. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by testing known HEV-RNA-positive and -negative stool and serum specimens and the sensitivity was evaluated using a synthetic HEV RNA standard. Profiles of viraemia and faecal shedding in two chimpanzees inoculated with an isolate of HEV genotype 1 showed the appearance of virus in the stools on day 4 postinoculation (5.65-6.85 log copies/mg) and in the serum on day 7 postinoculation (6.0-6.93 log copies/mL). Peak HEV RNA levels in the stool and serum coincided with peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels observed on day 22 postinoculation in the two chimpanzees. At the time of detection of IgG anti-HEV in serum, viral RNA was no longer detectable in the stool or serum and ALT values had returned to normal levels in both chimpanzees, suggesting the efficacy of the immune response in terminating viral replication. Quantitative evaluation of HEV RNA in humans may allow determining the role of virus levels in the pathogenesis and transmission of HEV.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17109683&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tanaka, Hirokazu</author><author>Sejnowski, Terrence J.</author><author>Krakauer, John W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adaptation to visuomotor rotation through interaction between posterior parietal and motor cortical areas</title><secondary-title>Journal of Neurophysiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Neurophysiology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Neurophysiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2921-2932</pages><volume>102</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptation, Physiological</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>brain</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>cerebellum</keyword><keyword>Cerebellum</keyword><keyword>Generalization (Psychology)</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Models, Neurological</keyword><keyword>Motor Coordination</keyword><keyword>Motor Cortex</keyword><keyword>motor cortical areas</keyword><keyword>Movement</keyword><keyword>neurons</keyword><keyword>Neurons</keyword><keyword>Parietal Lobe</keyword><keyword>Photic Stimulation</keyword><keyword>posterior parietal area</keyword><keyword>Psychomotor Performance</keyword><keyword>Reaction Time</keyword><keyword>Rotation</keyword><keyword>Visual Pathways</keyword><keyword>visuomotor rotation</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-3077</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/jn.90834.2008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Studying how motor adaptation to visuomotor rotation for one reach direction generalizes to other reach directions can provide insight into how visuomotor maps are represented and learned in the brain. Previous psychophysical studies have concluded that postadaptation generalization is restricted to a narrow range of directions around the training direction. A population-coding model that updates the weights between narrow Gaussian-tuned visual units and motor units on each trial reproduced experimental trial-by-trial learning curves for rotation adaptation and the generalization function measured postadaptation. These results suggest that the neurons involved in rotation adaptation have a relatively narrow directional tuning width (â¼23Â°). Population coding models with units having broader tuning functions (such as cosine tuning in motor cortex and Gaussian sum in the cerebellum) could not reproduce the narrow single-peaked generalization pattern. Visually selective neurons with narrow Gaussian tuning curves have been identified in posterior parietal cortex, making it a possible site of adaptation to visuomotor rotation. We propose that rotation adaptation proceeds through changes in synaptic weights between neurons in posterior parietal cortex and motor cortex driven by a prediction error computed by the cerebellum.

Methods: Five years of fall data in an inpatient psychiatric facility, where falls were frequent but benign, were examined for patient and treatment characteristics that might be associated with falls. This was a retrospective analysis, which matched 1:1 the medical records of fallers and nonfallers on primary psychiatric diagnoses. The total sample consisted of 148 patients. Statistical analysis was conducted on patient demographic characteristics, summed medical history items reported, summed physical complaints on the day of the fall, the number and types of medications taken within a 24-hour period of the fall, and the patientâs vital signs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the most salient associations with faller status. Results: Univariate analyses revealed that fallers were prescribed significantly more medications and complained of more physical symptoms on the day of their fall. Fallers were more likely to have a current acute medical condition and to be currently prescribed clonazepam or antihypertensive medication. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that current physical complaints and current clonazepam treatment had significant associations with faller status. Conclusions: Risk factors identified in this study should be assessed in replication studies. Psychiatric clinicians can use such risk factors to create evidence-based fall prevention programs.

Most commonly, the participant is provided with supporting information about the phonological form of a particular word (either partial or complete, auditory or written), and must then generate the word orally. The provision of target phonology facilitates initial production of the word, which can then be repeatedly trained in order to induce relearning of the appropriate lexicalâphonological associations. Aims: The aim of the current case study was to examine the effectiveness of an indirect cueing technique for the treatment of mild impairments in phonological encoding. In this treatment the participant must name pictures without assistance, but the picture names themselves share a phonological relationship (e.g., magnet, mattress, macaroni). These phonologically similar triplets incorporate a form of phonological cueing; however, the cues do not involve the direct provision of the word form. Methods &amp; Procedures: The case reported here, patient TV, suffers from a mild phonological encoding impairment: he produces phonemic paraphasias and other form-related errors on longer and/or less frequent words in spontaneous speech and other spoken word production tasks. In the treatment, TV was asked to name triplets of pictures whose names were either phonologically related (sharing either initial or final phonemes) or unrelated. This procedure was repeated across 12 therapy sessions, all of which trained the same set of words. TVâs pre-treatment naming accuracy on the training words was assessed using a repeated baseline design, and was continuously reassessed throughout treatment, and also at 3 months post-therapy. The key comparison was between words trained within phonologically related triplets and control words trained in unrelated triplets. The design also included multiple assessments on an untrained set of words to assess generalisation. Outcomes &amp; Results: For this mild case, naming accuracy for all words trained improved significantly. However, gains were significantly faster for the words that were trained within phonologically related triplets than those trained in unrelated triplets. Significant generalisation to untreated items was also observed, and gains on both treatment items and generalisation effects were maintained at 3 months post therapy. Conclusion: Results from this case study suggest that this type of indirect cueing technique may be a particularly efficient method for treating mild impairments in phonological coding.

Design/methodology/approach: Using the Directory of Hotel &amp; Lodging Companies, a convenient sample group of 24 management companies are selected. A self-administered mail survey instrument is developed to measure and test organizational initiatives and practices on employee turnover and retention. Using SPSS 16.0, two statistical tests are employed to test study hypotheses. Correlation analysis is used to identify the relationships between predictor and response variables. Likewise, regression analysis is used to examine the relationships between predictor and response variables hypothesizing that the effectiveness of practicing the human resource management organizational initiatives on management and non-management retention and turnover will differ. Findings: The findings reveal that Corporate Culture, Hiringand Promotions and Training practices influence non-management employee retention. At the same time, Hiring and Promotion practices impact management retention, as well. Moreover, Organizational Mission, Goals and Direction, and Employee Recognition, Rewards and Compensation were found to positively reduce non-management employee turnover. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the study methodology and the relatively low response rate, generalization of the study findings is limited. Future replication studies are recommended. Practical implications: The findings will equip lodging organizations and industry professionals with the contemporary tools to proactively reduce employee turnover and for maintaining employee retention. This should have a positive impact on workforce productivity. Originality/value: This study makes a major contribution to the relative influence of the practice of eight study-defined organizational initiatives on turnover in lodging businesses.

Overall, understanding the factors affecting rapid disease progression in early HIV infection (EHI) can aid in treatment initiation. Recent studies show that eIF3s, classic scaffold proteins during the translation initiation process, can directly promote or inhibit the translation of mRNA, therefore participating in the regulation of cell function. However, to our knowledge, it has not been addressed whether eIF3s are involved in the diverse prognosis of HIV infection.; Methods: Expression of eIF3s in primary cells from early or chronic HIV-infected patients was detected by real-time PCR. To investigate the potential mechanisms of eIF3d in the regulation of CD8+ T cell function, complete transcriptomes of eIF3d-inhibited Jurkat T cells were sequenced by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Additionally, to examine the effect of eIF3d on CD8+ T cell function, eIF3d expression was inhibited alone or in combination with SOCS-7 knockdown by siRNA in isolated CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cell proliferation, IFN-r secretion and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Moreover, the effect of eIF3d on HIV replication was evaluated in Jurkat cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CD4+ T cells with eIF3d knockdown using a pNL4-3 pseudotyped virus.; Results: At approximately 100Â days of infection, only eIF3d was markedly decreased in RPs compared with chronic progressors (CPs). Expression of eIF3d correlated significantly with disease progression in EHI. Based on in vitro analyses, reduced eIF3d expression led to decreased proliferation and IFN-Î³ secretion and increased apoptosis in CD8+ T cells. Inhibited expression of eIF3d caused enhanced expression of SOCS-7, and inhibiting SOCS-7 expression by siRNA rescued the attenuated CD8+ T cell function caused by eIF3d. Finally, when eIF3d was inhibited in Jurkat cells, PBMCs and CD4+ T cells, pNL4-3-VSV-G virus replication was enhanced.; Conclusions: The current data highlight the importance of eIF3d in HIV infection by inhibiting CD8+ T cell function and promoting viral replication. Our study provides potential targets for improved immune intervention.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31118081&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moore, Julia E</author><author>Liu, Barbara</author><author>Khan, Sobia</author><author>Harris, Charmalee</author><author>Ewusie, Joycelyne E</author><author>Hamid, Jemila S</author><author>Straus, Sharon E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can the effects of the mobilization of vulnerable elders in Ontario (MOVE ON) implementation be replicated in new settings: an interrupted time series design.</title><secondary-title>BMC geriatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC geriatrics</full-title><abbr-1>BMC geriatrics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>99</pages><volume>19</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Early Ambulation/*methods</keyword><keyword>Early Ambulation/*trends</keyword><keyword>Early Ambulation/psychology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Frail Elderly*/psychology</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization/trends</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Internal Medicine/methods</keyword><keyword>Internal Medicine/trends</keyword><keyword>Interrupted Time Series Analysis/*methods</keyword><keyword>Interrupted Time Series Analysis/*trends</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay/trends</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mobility</keyword><keyword>Mobilization</keyword><keyword>MOVE</keyword><keyword>Older adults</keyword><keyword>Ontario/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge/*trends</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-04-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2318</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12877-019-1124-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Bed rest for older hospitalized patients places them at risk for hospital-acquired morbidity. We previously evaluated an early mobilization intervention and found it to be effective at improving mobilization rates and decreasing length of stay on internal medicine units. The aim of this study was to conduct a replication study evaluating the impact of the evidence-informed mobilization intervention on surgery, psychiatry, medicine, and cardiology inpatient units.; Methods: A multi-component early mobilization intervention was tailored to the local context at seven hospitals in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcome was patient mobilization measured by conducting visual audits twice a week, three times a day. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and discharge destination, which were obtained from hospital decision support data. The study population was patients aged 65âyears and older who were admitted to surgery, psychiatry, medicine, and cardiology inpatient units between March and August 2014. Using an interrupted time series design, the intervention was evaluated over three time periods-pre-intervention, during, and post-intervention.; Results: A total of 3098 patients [mean age 78.46âyears (SD 8.38)] were included in the overall analysis. There was a significant increase in mobility immediately after the intervention period compared to pre-intervention with a slope change of 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-3.08, P-valueâ=Â 0.0014). A decreasing trend in median length of stay was observed in the majority of the participating sites. Overall, a median length of stay of 26.24âdays (95% CI 23.67-28.80) was observed pre-intervention compared to 23.81âdays (95% CI 20.13-27.49) during the intervention and 24.69âdays (95% CI 22.43-26.95) post-intervention. The overall decrease in median length of stay was associated with the increase in mobility across the sites.; Conclusions: MOVE increased mobilization and these results were replicated across surgery, psychiatry, medicine, and cardiology inpatient units.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=30953475&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Yingchang</author><author>Kweon, Sun-Seog</author><author>Tanikawa, Chizu</author><author>Jia, Wei-Hua</author><author>Xiang, Yong-Bing</author><author>Cai, Qiuyin</author><author>Zeng, Chenjie</author><author>Schmit, Stephanie L</author><author>Shin, Aesun</author><author>Matsuo, Keitaro</author><author>Jee, Sun Ha</author><author>Kim, Dong-Hyun</author><author>Kim, Jeongseon</author><author>Wen, Wanqing</author><author>Shi, Jiajun</author><author>Guo, Xingyi</author><author>Li, Bingshan</author><author>Wang, Nan</author><author>Zhang, Ben</author><author>Li, Xinxiang</author><author>Shin, Min-Ho</author><author>Li, Hong-Lan</author><author>Ren, Zefang</author><author>Oh, Jae Hwan</author><author>Oze, Isao</author><author>Ahn, Yoon-Ok</author><author>Jung, Keum Ji</author><author>Conti, David V</author><author>Schumacher, Fredrick R</author><author>Rennert, Gad</author><author>Jenkins, Mark A</author><author>Campbell, Peter T</author><author>Hoffmeister, Michael</author><author>Casey, Graham</author><author>Gruber, Stephen B</author><author>Gao, Jing</author><author>Gao, Yu-Tang</author><author>Pan, Zhi-Zhong</author><author>Kamatani, Yoichiro</author><author>Zeng, Yi-Xin</author><author>Shu, Xiao-Ou</author><author>Long, Jirong</author><author>Matsuda, Koichi</author><author>Zheng, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Study of East Asians Identifies Loci Associated With Risk for Colorectal Cancer.</title><secondary-title>Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gastroenterology</full-title><abbr-1>Gastroenterology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1455-1466</pages><volume>156</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Asia/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Asian People/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Colon Cancer*</keyword><keyword>Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Colorectal Neoplasms/ethnology</keyword><keyword>Colorectal Neoplasms/immunology</keyword><keyword>Epidemiology*</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Genetic Loci*</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variants*</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunology*</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide*</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1528-0012</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1053/j.gastro.2018.11.066</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background &amp; Aims: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have associated approximately 50 loci with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)-nearly one third of these loci were initially associated with CRC in studies conducted in East Asian populations. We conducted a GWAS of East Asians to identify CRC risk loci and evaluate the generalizability of findings from GWASs of European populations to Asian populations.; Methods: We analyzed genetic data from 22,775 patients with CRC (cases) and 47,731 individuals without cancer (controls) from 14 studies in the Asia Colorectal Cancer Consortium. First, we performed a meta-analysis of 7 GWASs (10,625 cases and 34,595 controls) and identified 46,554 promising risk variants for replication by adding them to the Multi-Ethnic Global Array (MEGA) for genotype analysis in 6445 cases and 7175 controls. These data were analyzed, along with data from an additional 5705 cases and 5961 controls genotyped using the OncoArray. We also obtained data from 57,976 cases and 67,242 controls of European descent. Variants at identified risk loci were functionally annotated and evaluated in correlation with gene expression levels.; Results: A meta-analyses of all samples from people of Asian descent identified 13 loci and 1 new variant at a known locus (10q24.2) associated with risk of CRC at the genome-wide significance level of P &lt; 5Â Ã 10 -8 . We did not perform experiments to replicate these associations in additional individuals of Asian ancestry. However, the lead risk variant in 6 of these loci was also significantly associated with risk of CRC in European descendants. A strong association (44%-75% increase in risk per allele) was found for 2 low-frequency variants: rs201395236 at 1q44 (minor allele frequency, 1.34%) and rs77969132 at 12p11.21 (minor allele frequency, 1.53%). For 8 of the 13 associated loci, the variants with the highest levels of significant association were located inside or near the protein-coding genes L1TD1, EFCAB2, PPP1R21, SLCO2A1, HLA-G, NOTCH4, DENND5B, and GNAS. For other intergenic loci, we provided evidence for the possible involvement of the genes ALDH7A1, PRICKLE1, KLF5, WWOX, and GLP2R. We replicated findings for 41 of 52 previously reported risk loci.; Conclusions: We showed that most of the risk loci previously associated with CRC risk in individuals of European descent were also associated with CRC risk in East Asians. Furthermore, we identified 13 loci significantly associated with risk for CRC in Asians. Many of these loci contained genes that regulate the immune response, Wnt signaling to Î²-catenin, prostaglandin E2 catabolism, and cell pluripotency and proliferation. Further analyses of these genes and their variants is warranted, particularly for the 8 loci for which the lead CRC risk variants were not replicated in persons of European descent.

This hypothesis rests on the premise that virulence is an unavoidable and increasing cost because the parasite uses host resources to replicate. This cost associated with replication ultimately results in a deceleration in transmission rate because increasing within-host replication increases host mortality. Empirical tests of predictions of the hypothesis have found mixed support, which cast doubt about its overall generalizability. To quantitatively address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis of 29 empirical studies, after reviewing over 6000 published papers, addressing the four core relationships between (1) virulence and recovery rate, (2) within-host replication rate and virulence, (3) within-host replication and transmission rate, and (4) virulence and transmission rate. We found strong support for an increasing relationship between replication and virulence, and replication and transmission. Yet, it is still uncertain if these relationships generally decelerate due to high within-study variability. There was insufficient data to quantitatively test the other two core relationships predicted by the theory. Overall, the results suggest that the current empirical evidence provides partial support for the trade-off hypothesis, but more work remains to beÂ done. (Â© 2019 The Author(s).

Secondary malignancies, such as therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, are caused by cancer chemotherapy agents administered to patients for the treatment of cancer. Occupational exposure to these agents was first documented in the 1970s and continues to occur, despite the issuance of safe handling guidelines in 1980s.; Objectives: Based on the evidence of carcinogenicity and genetic toxicity associated with direct administration of cancer chemotherapy agents and current evidence of occupational exposure, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review to: (1) evaluate whether occupational exposure (e.g., medical, manufacturing, research, and veterinary) is associated with any adverse health outcomes in humans, and (2) summarize the prevalence and levels of chemotherapy agents in the workplace as measured by environmental monitoring and biomonitoring for possible worker exposures.; Methods: The evaluation was conducted following the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) method. A literature search was performed up to February 23, 2017, using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Toxline, and Web of Science. Relevant human studies were data extracted and assessed for risk of bias. Bodies of evidence were assessed to develop confidence ratings and level-of-evidence conclusions that reflect the certainty in the evidence that occupational exposure to cancer chemotherapy agents are associated with health effects on a per outcome basis.; Results and Evidence Synthesis: The literature search and screening process identified 110 epidemiological studies relevant to assessing possible adverse health outcomes. Most studies addressing health outcomes evaluated potential DNA damage (n = 66; specifically, structural chromosomal aberrations (CA) and micronucleus (MN) induction and comet assay endpoints) and spontaneous abortion (n = 16). In addition to DNA damage, groups of studies were identified to evaluate the potential association between occupational exposure to cancer chemotherapy agents and adverse health outcomes, including cancer (three studies) and adverse effects on reproduction (30 studies). Additional health outcomes included acute effects, immune effects, and liver and kidney toxicity. One hundred seventy-one studies were identified to assess workplace exposure based on reporting of environmental contamination (107 studies) and urine and/or blood monitoring of these agents (82 studies).; Discussion and Conclusions: NTP concluded that there is a moderate level of evidence that occupational exposure to chemotherapy agents is associated with increased incidence of spontaneous abortion, particularly when evaluating studies of nursing and pharmacy personnel. NTP also concluded that there is a moderate level of evidence that exposure to chemotherapy agents in the workplace is associated with genetic toxicity in humans based on consistent reports significantly higher levels of structural CA (% of cells with CA and number of CA), MN induction (number of cells with MN and number of MN) and DNA damage measured by comet assay (% tail DNA, tail length, tail moment, and DNA damage index) in exposed personnel. There was inadequate evidence for NTP to reach level-of-evidence conclusions on the remaining health outcomes, including cancer, primarily due to few studies per outcome and heterogeneity in the data. Despite current safety guidelines, cancer chemotherapy agents were commonly detected in environmental samples of the workplace (e.g., surface wipes and air sampling) and biosamples (e.g., urine or blood) of workers handling these agents, including data collected as recently as 2014 to 2016. Considering the potential for occupational exposure to these agents and the association between exposure and DNA damage and spontaneous abortions, there is a continued need to reduce exposures through training in safe handling procedures and provision and use of personal protective equipment and associated safety containment equipment. Health surveillance of occupationally exposed personnel would also benefit from improved exposure characterization methods, such as use of daily diaries that are assessed and validated to estimate exposure levels and additional environmental monitoring and biomonitoring data that include analytical chemistry approaches to assess multiple agents. There is also a need to better understand the sources (i.e., activities or physical locations) of worker exposure, especially in settings that have not been adequately studied (e.g., home care, veterinary clinics).; Competing Interests: Individuals identified as collaborators in the About This Review section have certified that they have no known real or apparent conflict of interest related to cancer chemotherapy agents.

Recently, an approach was proposed to evaluate the dynamics of visual perception in high spatiotemporal resolution at the scale of the whole brain. This method combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with magnetoencephalography (MEG) data using representational similarity analysis and revealed a hierarchical progression from primary visual cortex through the dorsal and ventral streams. To assess the replicability of this method, we here present the results of a visual recognition neuro-imaging fusion experiment and compare them within and across experimental settings. We evaluated the reliability of this method by assessing the consistency of the results under similar test conditions, showing high agreement within participants. We then generalized these results to a separate group of individuals and visual input by comparing them to the fMRI-MEG fusion data of Cichy et al (2016), revealing a highly similar temporal progression recruiting both the dorsal and ventral streams. Together these results are a testament to the reproducibility of the fMRI-MEG fusion approach and allows for the interpretation of these spatiotemporal dynamic in a broader context.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31735809&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amaral, Olavo B</author><author>Neves, Kleber</author><author>Wasilewska-Sampaio, Ana P</author><author>Carneiro, Clarissa Fd</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative.</title><secondary-title>ELife</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ELife</full-title><abbr-1>ELife</abbr-1></periodical><volume>8</volume><keywords><keyword>biochemistry</keyword><keyword>Biochemistry/*methods</keyword><keyword>biomedical research</keyword><keyword>Biomedical Research/*methods</keyword><keyword>Brazil</keyword><keyword>cell biology</keyword><keyword>chemical biology</keyword><keyword>metascience</keyword><keyword>mouse</keyword><keyword>open science</keyword><keyword>rat</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword><keyword>reproducibility</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-02-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2050-084X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.7554/eLife.41602</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Most efforts to estimate the reproducibility of published findings have focused on specific areas of research, even though science is usually assessed and funded on a regional or national basis.

The results, due in 2021, will allow us to estimate the level of reproducibility of biomedical science in Brazil, and to investigate what aspects of the published literature might help to predict whether a finding is reproducible.; Competing Interests: OA, KN, AW, CC No competing interests declared (Â© 2019, Amaral et al.)</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=30720433&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bua, Gloria</author><author>Conti, Ilaria</author><author>Manaresi, Elisabetta</author><author>Sethna, Phiroze</author><author>Foster, Scott</author><author>Bonvicini, Francesca</author><author>Gallinella, Giorgio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antiviral activity of brincidofovir on parvovirus B19.</title><secondary-title>Antiviral research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antiviral research</full-title><abbr-1>Antiviral research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>22-29</pages><volume>162</volume><keywords><keyword>Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Brincidofovir</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytosine/*analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Cytosine/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Erythroid Precursor Cells/virology</keyword><keyword>Erythroid progenitor cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Organophosphonates/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Parvovirus B19</keyword><keyword>Parvovirus B19, Human/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Parvovirus B19, Human/physiology</keyword><keyword>Replication inhibition</keyword><keyword>UT7/EpoS1 cells</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1872-9096</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.12.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Parvovirus B19 (B19V), a single-stranded DNA virus in the family Parvoviridae, is a human pathogenic virus responsible for a wide range of clinical manifestations. Currently there is no approved antiviral therapy for parvovirus infection. The acyclic nucleoside phosphonate cidofovir (CDV) has been demonstrated to inhibit replication of B19V in vitro. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether brincidofovir (BCV), a novel lipid conjugate of CDV, could also inhibit B19V replication. Experiments were carried out in erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) and UT7/EpoS1 cells, infected with B19V and cultured in the presence of different concentrations of BCV and CDV for comparison. The dynamics of viral replication was evaluated by a qPCR-based assay and the extent of inhibition of viral replication exerted by the compounds determined, along with the effect of the compounds on cell viability and cell proliferation rates. Results confirmed that BCV showed significantly higher antiviral activity against B19V compared to CDV in both cell-based systems. For BCV, the calculated EC 50 values were in the range 6.6-14.3â¯Î¼M in EPCs and 0.22-0.63â¯Î¼M in UT7/EpoS1 cells. In comparison, the EC 50 values for CDV were &gt;300â¯Î¼M in EPCs and 16.1â¯Î¼M in UT7/EpoS1 cells. Concurrently, the effects on cell viability were observed at a much higher concentration of BCV, with calculated CC 50 values in the range 93.4-102.9â¯Î¼M in EPCs and 59.9-66.8â¯Î¼M in UT7/Epos1. The antiviral activity was observed specifically with the metabolically active stereoisomer of BCV suggesting that CDV-diphosphate, the metabolite of both BCV and CDV, was the active antiviral. Our results support a selective role for BCV in the inhibition of B19 viral replication. (Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Taking into consideration the observed increase in the spread of risk factors, modern demographic trends (an increase in the proportion of elderly people), and a high economic burden of circulatory system diseases, the search for new forms and effective strategies of prevention is becoming relevant. OBJECTIVE: To provide the data available in the scientific literature on the effectiveness of the measures to modify risk factors and lifestyle, which are implemented during balneotherapy under both resort and in non-resort conditions, and to define areas for further investigators in this field. Investigations evaluating the effectiveness of these measures were sought in the Embase, PubMed, PEDro, Web of Science, eLIBRARY databases in January 2012 to August 2018. The analysis included seven trials that showed an improvement of estimated endpoints (blood pressure, body mass index, lipid profile, physical activity, and morbidity and mortality rates). The generalization of results of the analyzed trials was limited by the high heterogeneity of their protocols and methodological quality, which does not allow for a final conclusion on the effectiveness of preventive measures implemented during balneotherapy. Future research should provide more evidence of the benefits of this approach. The analysis will be able to take into account the existing experience and to develop a strategy to enhance the effectiveness of cardiovascular disease prevention programs based on high-quality randomized clinical trials.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31513168&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thomas, B</author><author>Binkley, N</author><author>Anderson, P A</author><author>Krueger, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DXA Measured Distal Femur Bone Mineral Density in Patients After Total Knee Arthroplasty: Method Development and Reproducibility.</title><secondary-title>Journal of clinical densitometry : the official journal of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of clinical densitometry : the official journal of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of clinical densitometry : the official journal of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>67-73</pages><volume>22</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Absorptiometry, Photon/*methods</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee*</keyword><keyword>Bone Density*</keyword><keyword>bone mineral density</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>DXA</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Femur/*diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Pilot Projects</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Period</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>total knee arthroplasty</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1094-6950</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jocd.2018.08.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is increasingly being performed. Distal femur periprosthetic fracture is a potentially catastrophic complication following TKA and existing data document substantial distal femur bone mineral density (BMD) loss following TKA. However, distal femur BMD is virtually never measured clinically as no consensus approach exists. This pilot study's purpose was to define regional BMD variation throughout the femur, suggest standard dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) regions of interest (ROIs) and evaluate BMD reproducibility at these ROIs.; Methods: Thirty volunteers 2-5 yr post TKA had both entire femurs imaged twice using a Lunar iDXA with subject repositioning between scans; the atypical femur fracture feature of enCORE software was utilized. To define femoral BMD distribution, custom 1 cm ROIs were stacked one atop the other starting at the intercondylar notch and continuing to the base of the lesser trochanter. Femur length was measured with the ruler tool to calculate distance at 5% increments. ROIs encompassing each 5% increment were utilized to measure BMD at each location. Descriptive statistics were used to determine mean BMD at each ROI and reproducibility at the 15%, 25%, 45%, 60%, and 80% ROIs.; Results: The 5 and 10% ROIs included prosthetic and/or patella, causing high BMD values. Distal femur BMD was lowest at the 15% ROI and was higher (p &lt; 0.05) at each more proximal ROI to 45%, then plateaued from 45% to 75%. BMD reproducibility at these regions was excellent; coefficient of variation (CV) from â¼1% to 3.5%. As periprosthetic fractures generally occur in the distal femur, we propose measuring femur BMD using ROIs placed at 15% and 25%. A 60% region could also be used as a highly cortical site.; Conclusion: Existing DXA capabilities allow distal femur BMD measurement with good reproducibility. Further research using standardized ROIs to assess distal femur BMD loss after TKA, and interventions to mitigate this loss, is indicated.

The concurrent validity of spatiotemporal activation maps obtained with this task has been previously verified through comparisons with the Wada test and electrocortical stimulation mapping. Consecutive late activity sources (&gt; 200 ms after stimulus onset) were modeled independently as equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) and used to identify the location of language-specific cortex in the left hemisphere (Wernicke's area).; Results: Linear displacement of the geometric center of the cluster of ECDs in this region ranged between 2 and 8 mm across subjects. Intraparticipant variability (range) in the onset latency of activity was +/-50 ms, while the range of change in global field power for the entire set of ECDs in Wernicke's area was less than 17% in all cases.; Conclusions: The results indicate that despite its many conceptual limitations the ECD model can provide reliable estimates of regional cortical activity associated with the engagement of linguistic processes.; Significance: The results highlight the need for reproducibility studies when research questions pose particular requirements for precision of estimates of regional neurophysiological activity.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=16099211&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Combs, Dennis R.</author><author>Tosheva, Aneta</author><author>Penn, David L.</author><author>Basso, Michael R.</author><author>Wanner, Jill L.</author><author>Laib, Kristen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Attentional-shaping as a means to improve emotion perception deficits in schizophrenia</title><secondary-title>Schizophrenia Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Schizophrenia Research</full-title><abbr-1>Schizophrenia Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>68-77</pages><volume>105</volume><number>1-3</number><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Attention</keyword><keyword>attentional-shaping</keyword><keyword>Cognition Disorders</keyword><keyword>Cognitive Therapy</keyword><keyword>emotional perception deficits</keyword><keyword>Emotional States</keyword><keyword>Emotions</keyword><keyword>Expressed Emotion</keyword><keyword>Facial Expression</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neuropsychological Tests</keyword><keyword>Psychiatric Status Rating Scales</keyword><keyword>Recognition (Psychology)</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement (Psychology)</keyword><keyword>schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenic Psychology</keyword><keyword>Social Behavior</keyword><keyword>Social Perception</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Visual Perception</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0920-9964</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.schres.2008.05.018</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Inability to recognize emotional expressions of others (emotion perception) is one of the most common impairments observed among individuals with schizophrenia. Such deficits presumably contribute much to the social dysfunction characteristic of schizophrenia. This study examined the efficacy of a novel attentional-shaping intervention to improve emotion perception abilities. Sixty participants with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions: 1) attentional-shaping, 2) contingent monetary reinforcement, or 3) repeated practice. Participants completed the Face Emotion Identification Test (FEIT) at pre-test, intervention, post-test, and one week follow-up. Participants also completed the Bell-Lysaker Emotion Recognition Test (BLERT) and the Social Behavior Scale at pre-test and follow-up to measure generalization. The results showed that the attentional-shaping condition had significantly higher scores on the FEIT at intervention, post-test, and follow-up compared to monetary reinforcement and repeated practice. Improvement was also found on the BLERT and a trend was found for improved social behaviors at one-week follow-up. Results will be discussed in terms of face scanning and attentional deficits present in schizophrenia and potential uses of this intervention in the remediation of emotion perception deficits.

In this follow-up study, we measured viral replication 2 years after vaccination challenge and determined the mechanism by which antigen-specific CD8+ T cells suppress viral replication. Method: From the original group of 18, we assessed the immune response in the 13 surviving animals. In addition, using cM-T807, we depleted CD8 lymphocytes to assess the role CD8 cells play in suppression of viral replication. Result: We found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinated animals had a robust simian immunodeficiency virus Gag-specific IFN-Î³ response. In addition, in the DNA and IL-15 group, we observed higher levels of simian immunodeficiency virus Gag-specific, proliferating CD8+ T cells. The profile of these cells revealed more central memory than effector cells. When we transiently depleted animals of CD8+ T cells, plasma viral load increased, and peak viral load was lower in the DNA and IL-15 group compared with the DNA alone and control groups. As CD8+ T cells recovered, viral replication was controlled and we observed an increase in the number of antigenspecific effector CD8+ T cells. Conclusion: We conclude that co-immunization with a simian/human immunodeficiency virus DNA-based vaccine and IL-15 achieves sustained viral suppression and that vaccine-induced CD8+ memory T cells, which differentiate into effector cells, are central to that suppression.

Subsequently, ENF was readministered for 4 weeks as pulse intensification. Methods: The proportion of plasma virus carrying the V38A mutation in gp41 was quantified by allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction in serial samples collected from 3 subjects at 1- to 4-week intervals. Fitness differences were calculated using a method that corrected for time dependence of the viral replication rate. Results: The V38A mutant made up â¥85% of the quasispecies at baseline and decayed to &lt;5% over 12-24 weeks; plasma HIV-1 RNA levels remained stable during this time. Fitness differences for mutant versus wild type ranged from -25% to -65%, providing in vivo evidence for the reduced fitness of ENF-resistant HIV-1. The V38A mutant virus reemerged rapidly during the ENF pulse. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the HIV-1 quasispecies undergoes dynamic changes in response to withdrawal and reinitiation of fusion inhibitor therapy. The relative stability of plasma HIV-1 titers during decay of V38A suggests that factors other than viral fitness likely define viral load set-point in patients with advanced disease.

Subjects who adapt to laterally deviating prism lenses during walking show a broad generalization to an arm pointing task, while subjects who adapt to prisms during arm pointing do not show generalization to walking. It is not known whether this broad generalization persists with other movements outside of walking or what specific features of the walking task, e.g. lower extremity involvement, allow it to be so broadly generalizable. In the current study, we tested healthy adult subjects performing one of three forms of prism adaptation and subsequently measured generalization. In Experiment 1 we tested whether a seated arm pointing prism adaptation would generalize to the leg. In Experiment 2 we tested whether a seated leg pointing prism adaptation would generalize to the arm. In Experiment 3 we tested whether standing influenced the extent of generalization from leg to arm. Results were surprising. We found a clear and consistent generalization from arm to leg, but much less so from leg to arm during either the seated or the standing task. These findings indicate that prism adaptations during arm movements are not limb-specific, as has been previously suggested. Further, the lack of generalization from leg to arm suggests that neither the adaptation of leg movements specifically, nor standing posture, nor the bilateral component of walking could be the salient feature allowing for its broad generalization across body parts.

The results replicated prior work in showing an enhanced N400 response and a sustained frontal negativity to concrete as compared with abstract nouns. The effect of concreteness on the N400 generalized to all word class and ambiguity conditions, whereas the frontal effect was present for all word types except for the syntactically and semantically ambiguous items when these were used as verbs. The seemingly dissociable ERP effects of concreteness at frontal and central/posterior electrode sites revealed by these data suggest that concreteness may impact multiple aspects of neurocognitive processing.

For species exhibiting phenotypic plasticity, embedding phenotypes in a model of population dynamics becomes important, as region-driven plastic responses play a significant role when estimating parameters values. In this paper, we discuss how to include observable characteristics and climate patterns in estimates of reproduction rates of whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Using many studies already available in the literature, we establish a strong correlation between reproduction rate and both body weight and USDA plant hardiness zone. We demonstrate the accuracy of the estimated whitetail deer fecundity rates for various geographical regions in North America and show that Bergmann's rule is necessary to maintain similar biological fitness between various spatial distributions of deer populations. We demonstrate that the standard deviation of the weight distribution has almost no effect on reproduction rate estimates for adult deer populations. However, statistical analysis reveals sensitivity of fawn reproduction rates to environmental stochasticity. We incorporate the reproduction function in a stage- and gender-based model and prove the existence of a stable solution. Finally, we demonstrate a possible application of the model using harvested deer weights, without collecting reproduction data directly. (Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous reproducibility studies of Doppler assessment of aortic stenosis (AS) have compared only a pair of observers and have not explored the mechanism by which disagreement between operators occurs. Using custom-designed software which stored operators' traces, we investigated the reproducibility of peak and velocity time integral (VTI) measurements across a much larger group of operators and explored the mechanisms by which disagreement arose.; Methods and Results: Twenty-five observers reviewed continuous wave (CW) aortic valve (AV) and pulsed wave (PW) left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) Doppler traces from 20 sequential cases of AS in random order. Each operator unknowingly measured each peak velocity and VTI twice. VTI tracings were stored for comparison. Measuring the peak is much more reproducible than VTI for both PW (coefficient of variation 10.1 vs. 18.0%; Pâ&lt;â0.001) and CW traces (coefficient of variation 4.0 vs. 10.2%; Pâ&lt;â0.001). VTI is inferior because the steep early and late parts of the envelope are difficult to trace reproducibly. Dimensionless index improves reproducibility because operators tended to consistently over-read or under-read on LVOT and AV traces from the same patient (coefficient of variation 9.3 vs. 17.1%; Pâ&lt;â0.001).; Conclusion: It is far more reproducible to measure the peak of a Doppler trace than the VTI, a strategy that reduces measurement variance by approximately six-fold. Peak measurements are superior to VTI because tracing the steep slopes in the early and late part of the VTI envelope is difficult to achieve reproducibly.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29346531&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fort, Joaquim</author><author>MercÃ¨ Pareta, Maria</author><author>SÃ¸rensen, Lasse</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the relative importance of demic and cultural diffusion in the spread of the Neolithic in Scandinavia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</abbr-1></periodical><volume>15</volume><number>148</number><issue>148</issue><keywords><keyword>cultural diffusion</keyword><keyword>Cultural Evolution/*history</keyword><keyword>demic diffusion</keyword><keyword>History, Ancient</keyword><keyword>Human Migration/*history</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Models, Theoretical*</keyword><keyword>neolithic transition</keyword><keyword>Scandinavia</keyword><keyword>Scandinavian and Nordic Countries</keyword><keyword>spread rate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-11-21</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1742-5662</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rsif.2018.0597</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Using a database of early farming sites in Scandinavia, we estimate that the spread rate of the Neolithic was in the range 0.44-0.66 km yr -1 This is substantially slower (by about 50%) than the rate in continental Europe. We interpret this result in the framework of a new mathematical model that includes horizontal cultural transmission (acculturation), vertical cultural transmission (interbreeding) and demic diffusion (reproduction and dispersal of farmers). To parametrize the model, we estimate reproduction rates of early farmers using archaeological data (sum-calibrated probabilities for the dates of early Neolithic Scandinavian sites) and use them in a wave-of-advance model for the first time. Comparing the model with the archaeological data, we find that the percentage of the spread rate due to cultural diffusion is below 50% (except for very extreme parameter values, and even for them it is below 54%). This strongly suggests that the spread of the Neolithic in Scandinavia was driven mainly by demic diffusion. This conclusion, obtained from archaeological data, agrees qualitatively with the implications of ancient genetic data, but the latter are yet too few in Scandinavia to produce any quantitative percentage for the spread rate due to cultural diffusion. We also find that, on average, fewer than eight hunter-gatherers were incorporated in the Neolithic communities by each group of 10 pioneering farmers, via horizontal and/or vertical cultural transmission.

However, analysis of low abundance sialylated glycopeptides (SGPs) from complex biological samples is still a big challenge. To solve the problem, materials with high SGPs enrichment selectivity should be designed and prepared. Inspired by the saccharide-saccharide interaction in life systems, a d-allose@SiO 2 (ABS) material was prepared and applied in SGPs enrichment under hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and nitrogen adsorption experiment results proved that the ABS matrix was successfully synthesized. The SGPs enrichment selectivity of ABS matrix was evaluated with Nano Electrospray Ionization Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (Nano ESI Q-TOF/MS). The results indicated that the SGPs enrichment selectivity was notably higher with the ABS matrix (24 SGPs) than the commercially available Sepharose CL-6B (9 SGPs) and TiO 2 (8 SGPs), taking digests of fetuin/bovine serum albumin (BSA) (1â:â10, w/w) as the test sample. The SGPs enrichment performance of ABS matrix was further validated by the interference, recovery rate, and reproducibility evaluation experiments. In the end, the ABS matrix was applied in the analysis of real biosample (HeLa cell lysates). Totally 301 SGPs with 277 glycosylation sites from 186 glycoprotein were successfully characterized by taking HeLa S3 cell lysate as target sample in two replicated experiments. The results indicated that the ABS matrix had great potential to be applied in the enrichment of SGPs from complex biological samples.; Competing Interests: There are no conflicts to declare.

The effects of miR-520a on HBV transcription and replication were assessed using methods including immunoassays and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to AKT on the levels of AKT mRNA and protein were also evaluated.; Results: In HepG2.2.15 cells, miRNA-520a reduced HBV transcription and replication by reducing AKT levels.

Certain pathogens impair the immune defense by downregulating the vitamin D receptor (VDR) pathway. Low serum levels of vitamin D are associated with increased hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Our study aimed to assess the in-vitro relationship between HBV production and Vitamin D signaling pathway and to explore the associated mechanism(s).; Methods: HBV transcription and replication was evaluated by qRT-PCR of the HBV-RNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Furthermore, we have transfected the 1.3 X HBV-Luc plasmid to the cells and measured the Luciferase activity using Luminometer. Vitamin D signaling pathway activation was evaluated by measuring the expression levels of VDR, CYP24A1, Tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±) and cathelicidin (CAMP) by qRT-PCR. All assays were performed on HepG2.2.15, HepG2, and HepAD38 cells treated with or without Vitamin D active metabolite: calcitriol.; Results: Calcitriol did not suppress HBV transcription, cccDNA expression or HBV RNA levels in HepG2.2.15 cells. However, VDR transcript levels in HepG2.215 cells were significantly lower compared to HepG2 cells. Similar results were obtained in HepAD38 cell where VDR expression was down-regulated when HBV transcript level was up-regulated. In addition, calcitriol induced VDR-associated signaling, resulting in upregulation of CYP24A1, TNFÎ± and CAMP expression level in HepG2 cells but not in the HepG2.2.15 cells.; Conclusions: These findings indicate that VDR expression is downregulated in HBV-transfected cells, thereby preventing vitamin D from inhibiting transcription and translation of HBV in vitro. HBV might use this mechanism to avoid the immunological defense system by affecting both TNFÎ± and CAMP signaling pathways.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=30326825&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buford, Thomas W</author><author>Manini, Todd M</author><author>Kairalla, John A</author><author>McDermott, Mary M</author><author>Vaz Fragoso, Carlos A</author><author>Chen, Haiying</author><author>Fielding, Roger A</author><author>King, Abby C</author><author>Newman, Anne B</author><author>Tranah, Gregory J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variants Associated With Blood Pressure Among 2 Cohorts of Older Adults.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Heart Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Heart Association</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of the American Heart Association</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e010009</pages><volume>7</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>aging</keyword><keyword>Aging/*genetics</keyword><keyword>blood pressure</keyword><keyword>Blood Pressure/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Cardiovascular Diseases/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Cardiovascular Diseases/physiopathology</keyword><keyword>DNA sequencing</keyword><keyword>DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>mitochondria</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-09-18</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2047-9980</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/JAHA.118.010009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background Age-related changes in blood pressure are associated with a variety of poor health outcomes. Genetic factors are proposed contributors to age-related increases in blood pressure, but few genetic loci have been identified. We examined the role of mitochondrial genomic variation in blood pressure by sequencing the mitochondrial genome. Methods and Results Mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA ) data from 1755 participants from the LIFE (Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders) studies and 788 participants from the Health ABC (Health, Aging, and Body Composition) study were evaluated using replication analysis followed by meta-analysis. Participants were aged â¥69Â years, of diverse racial backgrounds, and assessed for systolic blood pressure ( SBP ), diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure. After meta-analysis across the LIFE and Health ABC studies, statistically significant associations of mt DNA variants with higher SBP (m.3197T&gt;C, 16S rRNA ; P=0.0005) and mean arterial pressure (m.15924A&gt;G, t-RNA-thr; P=0.004) were identified in white participants. Among black participants, statistically significant associations with higher SBP (m.93A&gt;G, HVII ; m.16183A&gt;C, HVI ; both P=0.0001) and mean arterial pressure (m.16172T&gt;C, HVI ; m.16183A&gt;C, HVI ; m.16189T&gt;C, HVI ; m.12705C&gt;T; all P's&lt;0.0004) were observed. Significant pooled effects on SBP were observed across all transfer RNA regions ( P=0.0056) in white participants. The individual and aggregate variant results are statistically significant after multiple comparisons adjustment for the number of mt DNA variants and mitochondrial regions examined. Conclusions These results suggest that mt DNA -encoded variants are associated with variation in SBP and mean arterial pressure among older adults. These results may help identify mitochondrial activities to explain differences in blood pressure in older adults and generate new hypotheses surrounding mt DNA variation and the regulation of blood pressure.

While many intra-facility factors are known to influence the structure of mouse microbiomes, the contribution of inter-facility variation to mouse microbiome composition, especially in the context of disease, remains under-investigated. We replicated microbiome experiments using identical mouse lines housed in two separate animal facilities and report drastic differences in composition of microbiomes based upon animal facility of origin. We observed facility-specific microbiome signatures in the context of a disease model [the Ednrb (endothelin receptor type B) Hirschsprung disease mouse] and in normal C57BL/6J mice. Importantly, these facility differences were independent of cage, sex, or sequencing-related influence. In addition, we investigated the reproducibility of microbiome dysbiosis previously associated with Ednrb -/- (knock-out; KO) mice. While we observed genotype-based differences in composition between wild-type (WT) and KO mice, these differences were inconsistent with the previously reported conclusions. Furthermore, the genotype-based differences were not identical across animal facilities. Despite this, through differential abundance testing, we identified several conserved candidate taxa and candidate operational taxonomic units that may play a role in disease promotion or protection. Overall, our findings raise the possibility that previously reported microbiome-disease associations from murine studies conducted in a single facility may be heavily influenced by facility-specific effects. More generally, these results provide a strong rationale for replication of mouse microbiome studies at multiple facilities, and for the meticulous collection of metadata that will allow the confounding effects of facility to be more specifically identified.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=30079054&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Son, Jung Hoon</author><author>Xie, Gangcai</author><author>Yuan, Chi</author><author>Ena, Lyudmila</author><author>Li, Ziran</author><author>Goldstein, Andrew</author><author>Huang, Lulin</author><author>Wang, Liwei</author><author>Shen, Feichen</author><author>Liu, Hongfang</author><author>Mehl, Karla</author><author>Groopman, Emily E</author><author>Marasa, Maddalena</author><author>Kiryluk, Krzysztof</author><author>Gharavi, Ali G</author><author>Chung, Wendy K</author><author>Hripcsak, George</author><author>Friedman, Carol</author><author>Weng, Chunhua</author><author>Wang, Kai</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep Phenotyping on Electronic Health Records Facilitates Genetic Diagnosis by Clinical Exomes.</title><secondary-title>American journal of human genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of human genetics</full-title><abbr-1>American journal of human genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>58-73</pages><volume>103</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>biomedical informatics</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Child, Preschool</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>electronic health records</keyword><keyword>Electronic Health Records</keyword><keyword>exome</keyword><keyword>Exome/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing/methods</keyword><keyword>genome</keyword><keyword>Genomics/methods</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Infant, Newborn</keyword><keyword>knowledge engineering</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>natural language processing</keyword><keyword>next-generation sequencing</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>phenotyping</keyword><keyword>precision medicine</keyword><keyword>Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/genetics</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-07-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1537-6605</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.05.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Integration of detailed phenotype information with genetic data is well established to facilitate accurate diagnosis of hereditary disorders. As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p &lt; 2.2Â Ã 10 -16 ), supporting the value of phenotype-driven gene prioritization in diagnostic sequence interpretation. To assess the generalizability, we replicated this finding on an independent EHR dataset of ten individuals with a positive diagnosis from a different institution. We then assessed the broader utility by examining two additional EHR datasets, including 31 individuals who were suspected of having a Mendelian disease and underwent different types of genetic testing and 20 individuals with positive diagnoses of specific Mendelian etiologies of chronic kidney disease from exome sequencing. Finally, through several retrospective case studies, we demonstrated how combined analyses of genotype data and deep phenotype data from EHRs can expedite genetic diagnoses. In summary, EHR-Phenolyzer leverages EHR narratives to automate phenotype-driven analysis of clinical exomes or genomes, facilitating the broader implementation of genomic medicine.

For coexisting tropical tree species, the best established demographic trade-off is the growth-survival trade-off. However, we know surprisingly little about co-variation of growth and survival with measures of reproduction. We analysed demographic rates from seed to adult of 282 co-occurring tropical tree and shrub species, including measures of reproduction and accounting for ontogeny. Besides the well-established fast-slow continuum, we identified a second major dimension of demographic variation: a trade-off between recruitment and seedling performance vs. growth and survival of larger individuals (â¥Â 1Â cm dbh) corresponding to a 'stature-recruitment' axis. The two demographic dimensions were almost perfectly aligned with two independent trait dimensions (shade tolerance and size). Our results complement recent analyses of plant life-history variation at the global scale and reveal that demographic trade-offs along multiple axes act to structure local communities.

We have characterized the replication dynamics of a unit-copy plasmid F by a replication rate function defined as the probability per unit age interval of the cell cycle that a plasmid will initiate replication. Analysis of baby-machine data [J. Bacteriol. 170 (1988) 1380; J. Bacteriol. 179 (1997) 1393] by stochastics that make no detailed reference to underlying mechanism revealed that this rate function increased monotonically over the cell cycle with rapid increase near cell division. This feature is highly suggestive of a replication control mechanism that is designed to force most plasmids to replicate before cells undergo division. The replication rate function is developed anew from a mechanistic model incorporating the hypotheses that initiators are limiting and that steric hindrance of origins by handcuffing control initiation of replication. The model is based on correctly folded initiator protein monomers arising from an inactive dimer pool via chaperones in limiting amounts, their random distribution to high affinity sites (iterons) at the origin (ori) and an outside locus (incC), the statistical mechanics of bound monomer participation in pairing the two loci (cis-handcuffing), and initiation probability as proportional to the number of non-handcuffed ori-saturated plasmids. Provided cis-handcuffing is present, this model closely accounts for the shape of the replication rate function derived from experiment, and reproduces the observation that replication occurs throughout the cell cycle. Present concepts of iteron-based molecular mechanisms thus appear capable of yielding a quantitative description of unit-copy-number plasmid replication dynamics.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15212889&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Opijnen, Tim</author><author>Jeeninga, Rienk E</author><author>Boerlijst, Maarten C</author><author>Pollakis, Georgios P</author><author>Zetterberg, Veera</author><author>Salminen, Mika</author><author>Berkhout, Ben</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtypes have a distinct long terminal repeat that determines the replication rate in a host-cell-specific manner.</title><secondary-title>Journal of virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of virology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of virology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3675-3683</pages><volume>78</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>HIV Long Terminal Repeat/*genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*physiology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/classification</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Organ Specificity</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-538X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/jvi.78.7.3675-3683.2004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The long terminal repeat (LTR) transcriptional promoters of different human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 subtypes were inserted into the LAI molecular clone of subtype B. The viral genotypes represent seven subtypes (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) and one circulating recombinant form (AG). We performed replication studies with this isogenic set of viruses across six cellular environments. This approach revealed strong cellular environment effects, but the method was not sensitive enough to detect small differences in the replication rate between the subtypes. By conducting pairwise competition experiments between the virus variants in six cellular environments, we could demonstrate significant differences in the replication rates of the subtypes and that LTR-determined viral fitness depends both on the host cell type and the activation state of the cell. In addition, we determined the degree of conservation of the transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS) in the different-subtype LTRs by analyzing sequences from the HIV sequence database. The sequence analyses revealed subtype-specific conservation of certain TFBS. The results indicate that one should consider the possibility of subtype-specific viral replication rates in vivo, which are strongly influenced by the host environment. We argue that the multidimensional host environment may have shaped the genetic structures of the subtype LTRs.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15016888&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barbuto, John E.

An experimental setup consisting of accelerometers and a calibrated microphone was used to capture key and hammer movements, as well as the acoustic signal. Five selected keys were played by pianists with two types of touch ("staccato" and "legato"). Timing and dynamic differences between the original performance, the corresponding MIDI file recorded by the computer-controlled pianos, and its reproduction were analyzed. The two devices performed quite differently with respect to timing and dynamic accuracy. The Disklavier's onset capturing was slightly more precise (+/- 10 ms) than its reproduction (-20 to +30 ms); the BÃ¶sendorfer performed generally better, but its timing accuracy was slightly less precise for recording (-10 to 3 ms) than for reproduction (+/- 2 ms). Both devices exhibited a systematic (linear) error in recording over time. In the dynamic dimension, the BÃ¶sendorfer showed higher consistency over the whole dynamic range, while the Disklavier performed well only in a wide middle range.

Lack of an efficient culture system to grow high titers of virus, and the lack of an in vivo animal model system, has hampered the study of KSHV replication and pathogenesis. RRV is capable of replicating to high titers on fibroblasts, thus facilitating the construction of recombinant rhadinoviruses. In addition, the ability to experimentally infect naÃ¯ve rhesus macaques with RRV makes it an excellent model system to study gamma-herpesvirus replication. Our study describes, for the first time, the construction of a GFP-expressing RRV recombinant virus using a traditional homologous recombination strategy. We have also developed two new methods for determining viral titers of RRV including a traditional viral plaque assay and a quantitative real-time PCR assay. We have compared the replication of wild-type RRV with that of the RRV-GFP recombinant virus in one-step growth curves. We have also measured the sensitivity of RRV to a small panel of antiviral drugs. The development of both the recombination strategy and the viral quantitation assays for RRV will lay the foundation for future studies to evaluate the contribution of individual genes to viral replication both in vitro and in vivo.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=12890626&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lai, Daniel W L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring depression of elderly Chinese Americans: a replication study.</title><secondary-title>Home health care services quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Home health care services quarterly</full-title><abbr-1>Home health care services quarterly</abbr-1></periodical><pages>69-85</pages><volume>22</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Asian/*psychology</keyword><keyword>Attitude to Health/ethnology</keyword><keyword>China/ethnology</keyword><keyword>Community Mental Health Services/statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>Culture</keyword><keyword>Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Depressive Disorder/*ethnology</keyword><keyword>Depressive Disorder/classification</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Geriatric Assessment</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Psychiatric Status Rating Scales</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Washington/epidemiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0162-1424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1300/J027v22n02_05</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Research findings aimed at understanding depression in ethnic elderly Chinese are lacking.

Here, we assessed the replicability of this finding. We measured D2 receptors with PET and [(11)C]raclopride (twice to determine stability) in seven nondrug-abusing subjects to assess if they predicted the self-reports of "drug-liking" to intravenous methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg). DA D2 measures were significantly correlated with "drug-liking" in both evaluations (r = 0.82 and r = 0.78); subjects with the lowest levels reported the higher ratings of "drug-liking" and vice versa. These results replicate our previous findings and provide further evidence that striatal DA D2 receptors modulate reinforcing responses to stimulants in humans and may underlie predisposition for drug self-administration.

By using previously published data of experiments with Classical Swine Fever Virus more extensively, we obtained smaller confidence intervals than the martingale method used in the original papers. Moreover, our method allows simultaneous estimation of a reproduction ratio within pens R0w and a modified reproduction ratio between pens R'0b. Resulting estimates of R0w and R'0b for weaner pigs were 100 (95% CI 54.4-186) and 7.77 (4.68-12.9), respectively. For slaughter pigs they were 15.5 (6.20-38.7) and 3.39 (1.54-7.45), respectively. We believe, because of the smaller confidence intervals we were able to obtain, that the method presented here is better suited for use in future experiments.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=12002548&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Richards, Todd L.</author><author>Kozak, Leila</author><author>Johnson, L.

Functional MRI and EEG methods were used in the present study in an attempt to replicate these findings. Design/settings: Subjects were electrically and magnetically shielded because of the characteristic surroundings of the scanner room. During the experiment, the nonstimulated subject was placed in the scanner with sensory isolating goggles covering the subject's eyes. The stimulated subject was placed 30 feet away and sat in front of a video monitor that presented an alternating schedule of six stimulus-on/stimulus-off conditions. The stimulus-on condition consisted of a flickering checkerboard pattern whereas the stimulus-off condition consisted of a static checkerboard. Stimulus-on/-off conditions were presented in the sequence on/off/on/off/on/off. The duration of these intervals was randomly assigned but consistently provided a total of 150 seconds of flicker and 150 seconds of static. Sessions were repeated twice to assess possible replication of the phenomenon. Outcome measures: Changes in fMRI brain activation (relating to blood oxygenation) and EEG signals were measured in the nonstimulated subjects. Changes occurring during stimulus-on conditions were statistically compared to changes occurring during the stimulus-off conditions. Results: Statistically significant changes in fMRI brain activation and EEG signals were observed when comparing the stimulus-on condition to the stimulus-off condition in nonstimulated subjects (p&lt;0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons). For fMRI, these changes were observed in visual brain areas 18 and 19 (Brodmann areas). One of the subjects replicated the results. Conclusions: These data replicate previous findings suggesting that correlated neural signals may be detected by fMRI and EEG in the brains of subjects who are physically and sensorily isolated from each other.

There are several uses of shea oleine including its use as a frying oil and, after hardening, in margarine and toffee fat. This investigation was performed to examine the toxicity of 7 or 15% hardened shea oleine in comparison with 7 or 15% unhardened shea oleine and various commercially available materials, sheanut and palm oils, cocoa butter and toffee powder following dietary administration to rats during pre-mating, mating, pregnancy and offspring weaning in two separate investigations. Reproduction was assessed using number of litters and pups born plus survival and body weights at birth and at weaning on day 21. Skeletal evaluation using X-ray, clinical pathology and a macroscopic examination were also performed for F1 rats. Study measures for parent animals comprised evaluation of body weight, food consumption, clinical pathology, organ weights and macroscopic examination. Fatty acids and hydrocarbon levels were measured and an evaluation for lipogranulomata was made for various tissues. Results showed that shea oleine, whether unhardened or hardened, produced no evidence of reproduction toxicity and gave a similar profile to the other commercially available materials used in this study in the rat. Minor findings with shea oleine were not related to reproduction performance but comprised slightly reduced body weight gain and reduced cholesterol and raised alkaline phosphatase levels. None of the findings in this study were considered to be of toxicological significance. Thus, no evidence of reproduction toxicity was seen for both unhardened and hardened shea oleine in this investigation in the rat at levels equating to greater than 7.5 g/kg/day.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11498269&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, Danson R.</author><author>Macias, Cathaleene</author><author>Barreira, Paul J.</author><author>Fisher, William H.</author><author>Hargreaves, William A.</author><author>Harding, Courtenay M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence, severity, and co-occurrence of chronic physical health problems of persons with serious mental illness</title><secondary-title>Psychiatric Services</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychiatric Services</full-title><abbr-1>Psychiatric Services</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1250-1257</pages><volume>55</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Chronic Illness</keyword><keyword>chronic physical health problems</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Costs and Cost Analysis</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infection</keyword><keyword>Insurance Claim Review</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Massachusetts</keyword><keyword>Medicaid</keyword><keyword>Mental Disorders</keyword><keyword>mental illness</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Physical Disorders</keyword><keyword>Physical Health</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive</keyword><keyword>Serious Mental Illness</keyword><keyword>severity</keyword><keyword>Severity (Disorders)</keyword><keyword>Substance-Related Disorders</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1075-2730</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1176/appi.ps.55.11.1250</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objectives: This study examined Medicaid claims forms to determine the prevalence, severity, and co-occurrence of physical illness within a representative sample of persons with serious mental illness (N= 147). Methods: Representativeness of health problems in the study sample was established through comparison with a larger sample of persons with serious mental illness enrolled in Medicaid within the same state. Standardized annual costs were then assigned to Medicaid claims diagnoses, and individual health problem severity was measured as the sum of estimated treatment costs for diagnosed conditions. Results: Seventy-four percent of the study sample (N= 109) had been given a diagnosis of at least one chronic health problem, and 50 percent (N=73) had been given a diagnosis of two or more chronic health problems. Of the 14 chronic health conditions surveyed, chronic pulmonary illness was the most prevalent (31 percent incidence) and the most comorbid. Persons with chronic pulmonary illness were second only to those with infectious diseases in average annual cost of treatment ($8,277). Also, 50 percent or more of participants in eight other diagnostic categories had chronic pulmonary illness. A regression analysis identified age, obesity, and substance use disorders as significant predictors of individual health problem severity. Conclusions: Risk adjustment for physical health is essential when setting performance standards or cost expectations for mental health treatment. Excluding persons with chronic health problems from mental health service evaluations restricts generalizability of research findings and may promote interventions that are inappropriate for many persons with serious mental illness.

The study also examined the differential effects of each modality on students' acquisition of vocal behavior. Participants were two elementary school students with autism enrolled in a suburban public school. Training sessions involved presentations of preferred items, prompting and prompt fading procedures. Probes were conducted to evaluate the generalization of learned mands to classroom teachers. For one participant, sign language training produced a higher percentage of independent mands. PECS training produced a higher percentage of independent mands for the other participant. For both participants, sign language training produced a higher percentage of vocalizations during training. Mands learned with the experimenter generalized to classroom teachers. The results of the study suggest that acquisition of picture exchange and sign language may vary as a function of individual student characteristics, specifically, motor imitation skills prior to intervention. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal procedures for teaching both modalities to students with communication difficulties.

Framework: The concepts of external validity and generalizability are examined, considering theoretical aspects of external validity and conflicting demands for internal validity in research designs. Methodological approaches for controlling threats to external validity and strategies to enhance external validity and generalizability of findings are discussed. Conclusions: Generalizability of findings is not assured even if internal validity of a research study is addressed effectively through design. Strict controls to ensure internal validity can compromise generalizability. Researchers can and should use a variety of strategies to address issues of external validity and enhance generalizability of findings. Enhanced external validity and assessment of generalizability of findings can facilitate more appropriate use of research findings.

In typically developing children, this skill appears around age 4 years (S. Baron-Cohen, A. M. Leslie, and U. Frith, 1985), but it is delayed or absent in children with autism. In the present study, video modeling was used to teach perspective taking to three children with autism (all boys; aged 6 yrs and 1 mo-9 yrs and 5 mo). A multiple-baseline design across children and within child across tasks was used to assess learning. Generalization across untrained similar stimuli was also assessed. Video modeling was a fast and effective tool for teaching perspective-taking tasks to children with autism, resulting in both stimulus and response generalization. These results concurred with previous research that perspective taking can be taught. Unlike other studies, however, wider ranges of generalization were found.

In 1997, the four participating sites published a genome scan on the initial set of 97 bipolar pedigrees. Fiftyâsix additional bipolar pedigrees have now been ascertained and evaluated. This replication pedigree set contains 354 genotyped subjects, including 139 bipolar I (BPI) subjects, five schizoaffective bipolar type SA/BP subjects, 41 bipolar II (BPII) subjects, and 43 recurrent unipolar (RUP) depression subjects. Our site has recently genotyped the replication study bipolar pedigrees using 107 microsatellite markers from chromosomes 4, 7, 9, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We are now reporting parametric and nonparametric linkage results from this effort. Multipoint nonparametric linkage analysis produced three candidate regions with allele sharing LOD scores â¥ 1.0. The linkage signal on 4q35 peaked between markers D4S3335 and D4S2390 with an allele sharing LOD score of 2.49. This finding exceeds standard criteria for suggestive linkage. Two additional loci approach suggestive linkage levels: the 4q32 finding had its maximum near marker D4S1629 with an allele sharing LOD score of 2.16, and the 20p12 finding peaked at D20S162 with an allele sharing LOD score of 1.82. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis produced similar findings. When we combined the genotype data from the original and the replication pedigree sets, 20p12 yielded a nonparametric LOD score of 2.38, which exceeds standard criteria for suggestive linkage, and a corresponding parametric HLOD score of 2.98. The combined analysis did not provide further support for linkage to 4q32 and 4q35.

Descriptive and experimental analyses suggested that the SIB of a 10-yr-old female with severe mental retardation was maintained by attention. Additional analyses identified physical contact as the type of attention maintaining SIB; therefore, it was hypothesized that physical proximity of an adult was a discriminative stimulus for SIB. Based on these findings, the distance between the S and a therapist was systematically varied to assess stimulus generalization. Results show that rates of SIB varied relative to the distance between the S and therapist; the highest percentage of SIB occurred with the therapist positioned less than 0.5 m from the S. Treatment consisted of placing the therapist at a specified distance (9.0 m) from the S (during low-attention situations), noncontingent reinforcement, and extinction.

The aim of this review was to identify interventions that have potential to prevent substance use disorders in adolescence by treating internalizing disorders in childhood. Results suggest that a variety of behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and pharmacological interventions are effective in reducing symptoms of childhood depression, phobias, and anxiety disorders. None of the studies reviewed included substance abuse outcomes. Thus, little can be said about the relationship between early treatment and the prevention of later substance use. The importance of evaluating the generalizability of research-supported interventions to community settings is highlighted and recommendations for future research are offered.

P. Solomon et al, 1996) that used a constant-effort task involving the tongue and hand as an assessment technique for fatigue and extended the findings to include surface electromyographic (EMG) data. Pressure and surface EMG signals were collected simultaneously while 10 19-26 yr olds performed the constant-effort task at 50% of maximum pressure with the tongue and hand. Results show that 81% of pressure data were modeled by a negative exponential equation with a nonzero asymptote; 73% of the corresponding EMG data also fit this mathematical model. Pressure signals decayed more slowly than the corresponding EMG signals, particularly for the hand. After participants fatigued the tongue and hand with repeated brief maximal voluntary contractions, time constants were reduced for the tongue but not the hand. These results corroborate the previous finding that the time constant is a replicable measure. Reduction in the time constant after inducing acute fatigue in the tongue (but not the hand) was replicated. EMG data suggest that decreases in neuromuscular drive contributed to the decrease in pressure during the task. These observations support the hypothesis that the task reflects, at least in part, central fatigue processes.

The scale was tested in research which involved 240 1st-4th grade children. Psychometric analysis shows that dimensionality, internal consistency, and validity of the scale were adequate. Girls rated themselves higher on academic competence and artistic aesthetic competence and interest in artistic activities, while boys rated themselves higher on negative behavior and motor competence. Significant grade differences were found in self-perception of anxiousness and social acceptance. It is stated that replication studies using clinical groups and samples from different cultures will be needed to assess the generalizability of the results.

The map is formed in the brain with elements that allow for generalization beyond the region of training. The authors quantified spatial generalization properties of these elements by training in 1 extreme of the reachable space and testing near another, using 34 right-handed individuals (mean age 25 yrs). Training resulted in rotations in the preferred direction (PD) of activation of some arm muscles. The authors designed force fields that maintained a constant rotation in muscle PDs as the shoulder joint rotated in the horizontal plane. In such fields, training in a small region resulted in generalization to near and far work spaces. In 1 such field, the forces on the hand reversed directions for a given hand velocity with respect to the location of original training. Despite this, there was generalization. However, if the field was such that the change in the muscle PDs reversed as the work spaces changed, then performance was worse than performance of naive Ss. Data suggest that the sensorimotor map of arm dynamics is represented in the brain by elements that globally encode the position of the arm but locally encode its velocity.

For example, sport-oriented performance enhancement skills are often regarded as life skills that can also facilitate adaptation in other areas of life. Moreover, task-specific increases in self-efficacy produced by coping skills training could generalize to broader self-referent cognitive domains and affect global personality traits such as self-esteem and locus of control. The concept of generalization is analyzed, and factors and procedures that influence the strength and breadth of generalization effects are discussed. Several coping skills studies that address generalization effects of stress management and self-defense training are described, and the author suggests that generalization assessment should be a focal rather than incidental consideration when evaluating coping skills interventions.

DNA replication results in demethylated DNA, topological changes, removal of proteins and recruitment of proteins to promoters. One or more of these effects of DNA replication may facilitate late gene transcription. Using 5-azacytidine to promote demethylation of DNA, we demonstrate that late gene transcription cannot be rescued by DNA demethylation. Late gene transcription precedes significant increases in DNA copy number, indicating that increased template numbers also do not contribute to the linkage between replication and late gene transcription. By using serial, timed blockade of DNA replication and measurement of late gene mRNA accumulation, we demonstrate that late gene transcription requires ongoing DNA replication. Consistent with these findings, blocking DNA replication led to dissolution of DNA replication complexes which also contain RNA polymerase II and BGLF4, an EBV protein required for transcription of several late genes. These data indicate that ongoing DNA replication maintains integrity of a replication-transcription complex which is required for recruitment and retention of factors necessary for late gene transcription.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29813138&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karisto, Petteri</author><author>Hund, Andreas</author><author>Yu, Kang</author><author>Anderegg, Jonas</author><author>Walter, Achim</author><author>Mascher, Fabio</author><author>McDonald, Bruce A</author><author>Mikaberidze, Alexey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ranking Quantitative Resistance to Septoria tritici Blotch in Elite Wheat Cultivars Using Automated Image Analysis.</title><secondary-title>Phytopathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Phytopathology</full-title><abbr-1>Phytopathology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>568-581</pages><volume>108</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Ascomycota/pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Disease Resistance/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Plant Breeding</keyword><keyword>Plant Diseases/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Plant Diseases/microbiology</keyword><keyword>Plant Leaves</keyword><keyword>Quantitative Trait, Heritable</keyword><keyword>Triticum/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Triticum/microbiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0031-949X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1094/PHYTO-04-17-0163-R</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Quantitative resistance is likely to be more durable than major gene resistance for controlling Septoria tritici blotch (STB) on wheat. Earlier studies hypothesized that resistance affecting the degree of host damage, as measured by the percentage of leaf area covered by STB lesions, is distinct from resistance that affects pathogen reproduction, as measured by the density of pycnidia produced within lesions. We tested this hypothesis using a collection of 335 elite European winter wheat cultivars that was naturally infected by a diverse population of Zymoseptoria tritici in a replicated field experiment. We used automated image analysis of 21,420 scanned wheat leaves to obtain quantitative measures of conditional STB intensity that were precise, objective, and reproducible. These measures allowed us to explicitly separate resistance affecting host damage from resistance affecting pathogen reproduction, enabling us to confirm that these resistance traits are largely independent. The cultivar rankings based on host damage were different from the rankings based on pathogen reproduction, indicating that the two forms of resistance should be considered separately in breeding programs aiming to increase STB resistance. We hypothesize that these different forms of resistance are under separate genetic control, enabling them to be recombined to form new cultivars that are highly resistant to STB. We found a significant correlation between rankings based on automated image analysis and rankings based on traditional visual scoring, suggesting that image analysis can complement conventional measurements of STB resistance, based largely on host damage, while enabling a much more precise measure of pathogen reproduction. We showed that measures of pathogen reproduction early in the growing season were the best predictors of host damage late in the growing season, illustrating the importance of breeding for resistance that reduces pathogen reproduction in order to minimize yield losses caused by STB. These data can already be used by breeding programs to choose wheat cultivars that are broadly resistant to naturally diverse Z. tritici populations according to the different classes of resistance.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29210601&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>RypuÅa, Krzysztof</author><author>Kumala, Aleksandra</author><author>PÅoneczka-Janeczko, Katarzyna</author><author>Lis, PaweÅ</author><author>Karuga-KuÅºniewska, Ewa</author><author>Dudek, Krzysztof</author><author>CaÅkosiÅski, Ireneusz</author><author>KuÅºnik, Patrycja</author><author>ChorbiÅski, PaweÅ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Occurrence of reproductive disorders in pig herds with and without Chlamydia suis infection - statistical analysis of breeding parameters.</title><secondary-title>Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho</full-title><abbr-1>Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho</abbr-1></periodical><pages>817-824</pages><volume>89</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>breeding parameters</keyword><keyword>Breeding*</keyword><keyword>chlamydia</keyword><keyword>Chlamydia</keyword><keyword>Chlamydia Infections/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Chlamydia Infections/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Chlamydia Infections/physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Chlamydia suis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>reproduction</keyword><keyword>Reproduction*</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>swine</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1740-0929</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/asj.13000</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Chlamydiae are frequently encountered Gram-negative intracellular eubacteria that can cause clear manifestations or clinically asymptomatic disorders. C. suis and other chlamydia are primarily isolated in cases of reproductive disorders. This study was performed to estimate the impact of Chlamydia suis infection on reproduction in sows by analyzing reproduction rates and breeding parameters. The test was conducted on first generation (F1) pigs from Polish Landrace (PL)Â ÃÂ Polish Large White (PLW). Sixty-four herds were investigated and 500 vaginal swabs were collected. Isolation of DNA was carried out directly from the swabs. All samples were analyzed for Chlamydia suis by real-time PCR with a locked nucleic acid (LNA)-containing probe. To analyze the impact of chlamydia infection on reproductive parameters, evaluation questionnaires were used. Reproductive problems were found in 77.3% of the farms tested. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that in the farms with 10 up to 120 sows, there were higher reproductive problems with chlamydia infection than in smaller and bigger pig farms. The most common problems were estrus repetition, which was reported by 57.81% of the surveyed farms, and the birth of dead piglets, which was reported by 31.25% of the investigated pig farms. Abortions, which were reported by 28.12% of the surveyed farms, were the least common reproductive disorders.

Across different institutions, however, EMR quality can vary widely. This work investigated the impact of this disparity on the performance of three advanced machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and recurrent neural network. The EMR disparity was emulated using different permutations of the EMR collected at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU). The algorithms were trained using patients from the PICU to predict in-ICU mortality for patients on a held out set of PICU and CTICU patients. The disparate patient populations between the PICU and CTICU provide an estimate of generalization errors across different ICUs. We quantified and evaluated the generalization of these algorithms on varying EMR size, input types, and fidelity of data.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29854155&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Lingling</author><author>Wu, Xiaoyan</author><author>Shi, Jianli</author><author>Peng, Zhe</author><author>Zheng, Shuxuan</author><author>Xu, Shengnan</author><author>Han, Hong</author><author>Xin, Changxun</author><author>Liu, Yuwei</author><author>Gao, Mei</author><author>Yu, Jiang</author><author>Sun, Wenbo</author><author>Cong, Xiaoyan</author><author>Li, Jun</author><author>Xu, Shaojian</author><author>Wang, Jinbao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The correlation between the mutual deletions of amino acids within porcine circovirus rep protein and the discrepancy of replication.</title><secondary-title>Microbial pathogenesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microbial pathogenesis</full-title><abbr-1>Microbial pathogenesis</abbr-1></periodical><pages>327-334</pages><volume>117</volume><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Amino acids</keyword><keyword>Amino Acids</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Circoviridae Infections/virology</keyword><keyword>Circovirus/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Discrepancy of replication</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/genetics</keyword><keyword>Mutant</keyword><keyword>Open Reading Frames/genetics</keyword><keyword>Porcine circovirus</keyword><keyword>Rep protein</keyword><keyword>Sequence Alignment</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, Protein</keyword><keyword>Sequence Deletion*</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Vaccines</keyword><keyword>Viral Proteins/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1096-1208</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.micpath.2018.02.045</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Porcine circovirus (PCV) has two potential open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2. ORF1 is predicted to encode a replication-associated protein (Rep) essential for replication of viral DNA. In some studies, PCV1 replicated more efficiently in PK-15â¯cells than PCV2 was elucidated. PCV1 compared with PCV2; there is some amino acids' deficiency on Rep protein. To identify whether the above amino acids deletion affects the replication of PCV1 and PCV2, we constructed three double copy clones by overlap extension PCR. The 2PCV2(vV) clone deleted the valine of Rep protein in the backbone of PCV2 genome. The 2PCV2(dSGR) clone inserted serine, glycine and arginine of Rep protein successively in the backbone of PCV2 genome. The 2PCV2(dSGR&amp;vV) clone inserted serine, glycine and arginine as well as deleted the valine of Rep protein in the backbone of PCV2 genome. These clones we constructed with amino acid mutations and parental DNA clones were all transfected in PK-15â¯cells that free of PCV contamination, and their growth characteristics in vitro were determined and compared, to evaluating the replication of the mutant infectious DNA clones. Our results showed that the double copy infectious clones with amino acid mutations could be rescued in vitro. The 2PCV2(vV) replicated more efficiently than parental viruses 2PCV2 and 2PCV1 but the replicated ability of 2PCV2(dSGR) and 2PCV2(dSGR&amp;vV) is attenuated than parental viruses 2PCV2 and 2PCV1. We can determine the valine is the important amino acid that cause PCV1 replicated more efficiently in PK-15â¯cells than PCV2 primarily. These findings are benefit for exploring the mechanisms of viral replication in pigs and important implications for PCV2 vaccine development. (Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, DNA combing shows that PREP1 down-regulation affects DNA replication rate, increases the number of simultaneously firing origins and the asymmetry of DNA replication, leading to DNA damage. Genome-wide analysis of replication timing by Repli-seq shows that, upon PREP1 down-regulation, 25% of the genome is replicated earlier in the S-phase. The targeted DNA sequences correspond to Lamin-Associated Domains (LADs), and include late-replicating (LRRs) and temporal transition regions (TTRs). Notably, the distribution of PREP1 DNA binding sites and of its target genes indicates that DNA replication defects are independent of the overall PREP1 transcriptional activity. Finally, PREP1 down-regulation causes a substantial decrease in Lamin B1 levels. This suggests that DNA is released from the nuclear lamina earlier than in the control cells and is available for replication, thus explaining timing defects and DNA damage.This is the first evidence that the replication timing of a specific fraction of the human genome is affected by PREP1 tumor suppressor. This previously unknown function might significantly contribute to the genomic instability observed in human tumors.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29453404&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biava, Mirella</author><author>Caglioti, Claudia</author><author>Castilletti, Concetta</author><author>Bordi, Licia</author><author>Carletti, Fabrizio</author><author>Colavita, Francesca</author><author>Quartu, Serena</author><author>Nicastri, Emanuele</author><author>Iannetta, Marco</author><author>Vairo, Francesco</author><author>Liuzzi, Giuseppina</author><author>Taglietti, Fabrizio</author><author>Ippolito, Giuseppe</author><author>Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria</author><author>Lalle, Eleonora</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Persistence of ZIKV-RNA in the cellular fraction of semen is accompanied by a surrogate-marker of viral replication.

Recent studies highlighted a preferential association of ZIKV with the cellular fraction (CF) of different specimen types. Our aim was to evaluate the presence of ZIKV-RNA in different body fluids, focusing on semen specimens to assess the ZIKV-RNA content in either the unfractionated sample, its CF or seminal plasma (SP). In addition, to establish if the presence of ZIKV genome was associated with active virus replication, we measured the levels of negative-strand ZIKV-RNA. ZIKV total-RNA was detected in blood, urine and unfractionated semen, and neg-RNA in semen CF and SP samples longitudinally collected from two ZIKV-positive men followed at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "L. Spallanzani", Italy. In both patients, ZIKV total-RNA was detected in CF with ct values always lower than in the corresponding unfractionated samples, and was observed even in the CF from negative unfractionated semen samples. In Patient 2, neg-RNA was also detected in CF, suggesting ongoing viral replication. Our results demonstrate higher clinical sensitivity of CF as compared to whole semen testing, emphasizing the need to extend ZIKV-RNA testing to CF, to rule out virus presence and the possible risk of sexual transmission.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29112766&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aznar, I</author><author>Frankena, K</author><author>More, S J</author><author>O'Keeffe, J</author><author>McGrath, G</author><author>de Jong, M C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantification of Mycobacterium bovis transmission in a badger vaccine field trial.</title><secondary-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</full-title><abbr-1>Preventive veterinary medicine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>29-37</pages><volume>149</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacille calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG)</keyword><keyword>Badgers</keyword><keyword>Basic reproduction ratio</keyword><keyword>BCG Vaccine/*administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Disease Reservoirs/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Disease Reservoirs/microbiology</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Ireland/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Mustelidae/*microbiology</keyword><keyword>Mycobacterium bovis</keyword><keyword>Mycobacterium bovis/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Transmission</keyword><keyword>Tuberculosis, Bovine/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Tuberculosis, Bovine/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Vaccination/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Vaccine efficacy for infectiousness</keyword><keyword>Vaccine efficacy for susceptibility</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-01-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1873-1716</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.10.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In the UK and Ireland, Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccination of badgers has been suggested as one of a number of strategies to control or even eradicate Mycobacterium bovis infection in badgers. In this manuscript, we present the results of a badger field trial conducted in Ireland and discuss how the novel trial design and analytical methods allowed the effects of vaccination on protection against infection and, more importantly, on transmission to be estimated. The trial area was divided into three zones North to South (A, B and C) where vaccination coverages of 0, 50 and 100%, respectively, were applied. Badgers were trapped over a 4year period. Badgers were assigned to either placebo or vaccine treatment, with treatment allocation occurring randomly in zone B. Blood samples were collected at each capture, and serology was performed in these samples using a chemiluminescent multiplex ELISA system (Enfer test). The analysis aimed to compare new infections occurring in non-infected non-vaccinated badgers to those in non-infected vaccinated ones, while accounting for the zone in which the badger was trapped and the infection pressure to which this individual badger was exposed. In total, 440 records on subsequent trappings of individual non-infected badgers were available for analysis. Over the study period, 55 new infections occurred in non-vaccinated (out of 239=23.0%) and 40 in vaccinated (out of 201=19.9%) badgers. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a cloglog link function was used for analysis. Statistical analysis showed that susceptibility to natural exposure with M. bovis was reduced in vaccinated compared to placebo treated badgers: vaccine efficacy for susceptibility, VE S , was 59% (95% CI=6.5%-82%). However, a complete lack of effect from BCG vaccination on the infectivity of vaccinated badgers was observed, i.e. vaccine efficacy for infectiousness (VE I ) was 0%. Further, the basic reproduction ratio as a function of vaccination coverage (p) (i.e. R(p)) was estimated. Given that the prevalence of M. bovis infection in badgers in endemic areas in Ireland is approximately 18%, we estimated the reproduction ratio in the unvaccinated population as R(0)=1.22. Because VE S was now known, the reproduction ratio for a fully vaccinated population was estimated as R(1)=0.50. These results imply that with vaccination coverage in badgers exceeding 30%, eradication of M. bovis in badgers in Ireland is feasible, provided that the current control measures also remain in place.

The aim of this study was to assess potential biomarkers to predict outcomes for people with IPF.; Methods: PROFILE is a large prospective longitudinal cohort of treatment-naive patients with IPF. We adopted a two-stage discovery and validation design using patients from the PROFILE cohort. For the discovery analysis, we examined 106 patients and 50 age and sex matched healthy controls from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and the Royal Brompton Hospital. We did an unbiased, multiplex immunoassay assessment of 123 biomarkers. We further investigated promising novel markers by immunohistochemical assessment of IPF lung tissue. In the validation analysis, we examined samples from 206 people with IPF from among the remaining 212 patients recruited to PROFILE Central England. We used the samples to attempt to replicate the biomarkers identified from the discovery analysis by use of independent immunoassays for each biomarker. We investigated the predictive power of the selected biomarkers to identify individuals with IPF who were at risk of progression or death. The PROFILE studies are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01134822 (PROFILE Central England) and NCT01110694 (PROFILE Royal Brompton Hospital).; Findings: In the discovery analysis, we identified four serum biomarkers (surfactant protein D, matrix metalloproteinase 7, CA19-9, and CA-125) that were suitable for replication. Histological assessment of CA19-9 and CA-125 suggested that these proteins were markers of epithelial damage. Replication analysis showed that baseline values of surfactant protein D (46Â·6 ng/mL vs 34Â·6 ng/mL, p=0Â·0018) and CA19-9 (53Â·7 U/mL vs 22Â·2 U/mL; p&lt;0Â·0001) were significantly higher in patients with progressive disease than in patients with stable disease, and rising concentrations of CA-125 over 3 months were associated with increased risk of mortality (HR 2Â·542, 95% CI 1Â·493-4Â·328, p=0Â·00059).; Interpretation: We have identified serum proteins secreted from metaplastic epithelium that can be used to predict disease progression and death in IPF.; Funding: GlaxoSmithKline R&amp;D and the UK Medical Research Council.

The JCPyV genome is composed of an early region and a late region, which are physically separated by the non-coding control region (NCCR). The DNA sequence of the NCCR distinguishes two forms of JCPyV, the designated archetype and the prototype, which resulted from a rearrangement of the archetype sequence. To date, the cell culture systems for propagating JCPyV archetype have been very limited in their availability and robustness. Prior to this study, it was demonstrated that JCPyV archetype DNA replicates in COS-7 simian kidney cells expressing SV40 TAg and COS-7 cells expressing HIV-1 Tat. Based on these observations, the present study was conducted to reproduce an in vitro model in COS-7 cells transfected with the JCPyV archetype strain in order to study JCPyV DNA replication and analyze NCCR rearrangements during the viral life cycle. The efficiency of JCPyV replication was evaluated by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) and by hemagglutination (HA) assay after transfection. In parallel, sequence analysis of JCPyV NCCR was performed. JCPyV efficiently replicated in kidney-derived COS-7 cells, as demonstrated by a progressive increase in viral load and virion particle production after transfection. The archetypal structure of NCCR was maintained during the viral cycle, but two characteristic point mutations were detected 28 days after transfection. This model is a useful tool for analyzing NCCR rearrangements during in vitro replication in cells that are sites of viral persistence, such as tubular epithelial cells of the kidney.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28884263&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson, Katie A</author><author>Wetmore, Stacey D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conformational Flexibility of the Benzyl-Guanine Adduct in a Bypass Polymerase Active Site Permits Replication: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations.</title><secondary-title>Chemical research in toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical research in toxicology</full-title><abbr-1>Chemical research in toxicology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2013-2022</pages><volume>30</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Catalytic Domain</keyword><keyword>Crystallography, X-Ray</keyword><keyword>DNA Adducts/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Adducts/chemistry</keyword><keyword>DNA Adducts/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Damage</keyword><keyword>DNA Repair</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication</keyword><keyword>DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Guanine/*analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Guanine/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Molecular Dynamics Simulation</keyword><keyword>Sulfolobus solfataricus/*enzymology</keyword><keyword>Sulfolobus solfataricus/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Sulfolobus solfataricus/genetics</keyword><keyword>Sulfolobus solfataricus/metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-11-20</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1520-5010</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/acs.chemrestox.7b00179</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases play key roles in replicating DNA that contains nucleobase addition products (adducts), there are many unknowns about their function. The present work gains indispensable structural insights from molecular dynamics simulations on the replication of O6-benzyl-guanine (Bz-dG) prior to bond formation during dCTP insertion opposite the adduct by Dpo4. When combined with previous X-ray crystal structures of the Bz-dG extension complex, molecular details are now available for each stage during a single TLS replication cycle for this carcinogenic lesion. Our calculations illustrate that Bz-dG preferentially adopts an intercalated bulky moiety orientation in the Dpo4 preinsertion complex, which stabilizes the complex through Bz-dG interactions with the previously replicated 3'-base pair and positions the carcinogenic group in the dNTP binding site. Nevertheless, the maintained inherent flexibility of Bz-dG due to a stark lack of interactions with the polymerase or template DNA allows the bulky moiety to adopt a major groove position opposite an incoming dCTP in an orientation that is conducive for the experimentally observed nonmutagenic bypass. Comparison of Bz-dG and canonical dG replication clarifies that the experimentally observed decrease in dCTP binding affinity and replication efficiency upon adduct formation is likely caused by a combination of factors, including the required template nucleotide conformational change and destabilized template-dCTP hydrogen bonding. Although additional aspects of the replication process, such as the impact of the adduct on the nucleotidyl-transfer reaction, may also be important for fully rationalizing experimental replication data and must be considered in future work, the present contribution emphasizes the importance of considering the effect of DNA damage on the early stages of the TLS process.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28810119&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Yujie</author><author>Nonnemacher, Michael R</author><author>Alexaki, Aikaterini</author><author>Pirrone, Vanessa</author><author>Banerjee, Anupam</author><author>Li, Luna</author><author>Kilareski, Evelyn</author><author>Wigdahl, Brian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional Studies of CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Site Located Downstream of the Transcriptional Start Site.</title><secondary-title>Clinical medicine insights.

The role of the DS3 element with respect to HIV-1 transactivation by Tat and viral replication has not been characterized. We have demonstrated that DS3 was a functional C/EBPÎ² binding site and mutation of this site to the C/EBP knockout DS3-9C variant showed lower HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation by C/EBPÎ². However, it was able to exhibit similar or even higher transcription levels by Tat compared to the parental LTR. C/EBPÎ² and Tat together further enhanced the transcription level of the parental LAI-LTR and DS3-9C LTR, with higher levels in the DS3-9C LTR. HIV molecular clone viruses carrying the DS3-9C variant LTR demonstrated a decreased replication capacity and delayed rate of replication. These results suggest that DS3 plays a role in virus transcriptional initiation and provides new insight into C/EBP regulation of HIV-1.; Competing Interests: Declaration of conflicting interests:The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29162980&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Wei</author><author>Xue, Jing-Hao</author><author>Yu, Weichuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What is the probability of replicating a statistically significant association in genome-wide association studies?</title><secondary-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</full-title><abbr-1>Briefings in bioinformatics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>928-939</pages><volume>18</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms*</keyword><keyword>Bayes Theorem*</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease*</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods</keyword><keyword>GWAS</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide*</keyword><keyword>replicability</keyword><keyword>replication study</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-11-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1477-4054</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bib/bbw091</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The goal of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to discover genetic variants associated with diseases/traits. Replication is a common validation method in GWASs. We regard an association as true finding when it shows significance in both primary and replication studies. A question worth pondering is what is the probability of a primary association (i.e. a statistically significant association in the primary study) being validated in the replication study? This article systematically reviews the answers to this question from different points of view. As Bayesian methods can help us integrate out the uncertainty about the underlying effect of the primary association, we will mainly focus on the Bayesian view in this article. We refer the Bayesian replication probability as the replication rate (RR). We further describe an estimation method for RR, which makes use of the summary statistics from the primary study. We can use the estimated RR to determine the sample size of the replication study and to check the consistency between the results of the primary study and those of the replication study. We describe an R-package to estimate and apply RR in GWASs. Simulation and real data experiments show that the estimated RR has good prediction and calibration performance. We also use these data to demonstrate the usefulness of RR. The R-package is available at http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/RRate.html. (Â© The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

For this study, an LSD outbreak was defined as the occurrence of at least one LSD case in a specified geographical area. An observational study was conducted on a total of 2053 (1304 vaccinated and 749 unvaccinated) cattle in 339 infected herds located in 10 sub-kebeles and a questionnaire survey was administered to 224 herd owners. Over 60% of the herd owners reported that the vaccine has a low to very low effect in protecting animals against clinical LSD; almost all of them indicated that the vaccine did not induce any adverse reactions. In the unvaccinated group of animals 31.1% were diagnosed with LSD while this was 22.5% in the vaccinated group (P&lt;0.001). Severity of the disease was significantly reduced in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated animals (OR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.49; 0.96). Unvaccinated infected animals were more likely (predicted fraction=0.89) to develop moderate and severe disease than vaccinated infected animals (predicted fraction=0.84). LSD vaccine efficacy for susceptibility was estimated to be 0.46 (i.e. a susceptibility effect of 0.54) while the infectiousness effect of the vaccine was 1.83. In other words, the vaccine reduces the susceptibility by a factor of two and increases infectiousness by approximately the same amount. LSD transmission occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated animals, the estimated reproduction ratio (R) was 1.21 in unvaccinated animals compared to 1.19 in vaccinated ones, and not significantly different. In conclusion, KS1 O-180 vaccination, as applied currently in Ethiopia, has poor efficacy in protecting cattle populations against LSD, neither by direct clinical protection nor by reducing transmission, and this signifies the urgent need to either improve the quality of the vaccine or to develop potent alternative vaccines that will confer good protection against LSD.

In this study, we present findings from genetic association analyses for total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and triglycerides in a large Hispanic/Latino cohort in the U.S., the Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).; Methods: We estimated a heritability of approximately 20% for each lipid trait, similar to previous estimates in Europeans. To search for novel lipid loci, we performed conditional association analysis in which the statistical model was adjusted for previously reported SNPs associated with any of the four lipid traits. SNPs that remained genome-wide significant (PÂ &lt;Â 5Â ÃÂ 10 -8 ) after conditioning on known loci were evaluated for replication.; Results: We identified eight potentially novel lipid signals with minor allele frequencies &lt;1%, none of which replicated. We tested previously reported SNP-trait associations for generalization to Hispanics/Latinos via a statistical framework. The generalization analysis revealed that approximately 50% of previously established lipid variants generalize to HCHS/SOL based on directional FDR r-valueÂ &lt;Â 0.05. Some failures to generalize were due to lack of power.; Conclusions: These results demonstrate that many loci associated with lipid levels are shared across populations.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29025430&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Molla, W</author><author>Frankena, K</author><author>DE Jong, M C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transmission dynamics of lumpy skin disease in Ethiopia.</title><secondary-title>Epidemiology and infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Epidemiology and infection</full-title><abbr-1>Epidemiology and infection</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2856-2863</pages><volume>145</volume><number>13</number><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal Husbandry/*standards</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Ethiopia</keyword><keyword>Linear Models</keyword><keyword>LSD</keyword><keyword>Lumpy skin disease virus/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Lumpy Skin Disease/*transmission</keyword><keyword>Lumpy Skin Disease/virology</keyword><keyword>reproduction ratio</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>transmission</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1469-4409</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0950268817001637</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a severe disease of cattle caused by a Capripoxvirus and often caused epidemics in Ethiopia and many other countries. This study was undertaken to quantify the transmission between animals and to estimate the infection reproduction ratio in a predominantly mixed crop-livestock system and in intensive commercial herd types. The transmission parameters were based on a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) epidemic model with environmental transmission and estimated using generalized linear models. The transmission parameters were estimated using a survival rate of infectious virus in the environment equal to 0Â·325 per day, a value based on the best-fitting statistical model. The transmission rate parameter between animals was 0Â·072 (95% CI 0Â·068-0Â·076) per day in the crop-livestock production system, whereas this transmission rate in intensive production system was 0Â·076 (95% CI 0Â·068-0Â·085) per day. The reproduction ratio (R) of LSD between animals in the crop-livestock production system was 1Â·07, whereas it was 1Â·09 between animals in the intensive production system. The calculated R provides a baseline against which various control options can be assessed for efficacy.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28768560&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brown, Robert H</author><author>Henderson, Robert J</author><author>Sugar, Elizabeth A</author><author>Holbrook, Janet T</author><author>Wise, Robert A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility of airway luminal size in asthma measured by HRCT.</title><secondary-title>Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>876-883</pages><volume>123</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>asthma</keyword><keyword>Asthma/*diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>Bronchi/*diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>computer tomography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung/*diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Organ Size/physiology</keyword><keyword>precision</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods</keyword><keyword>Total Lung Capacity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-10-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1522-1601</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/japplphysiol.00307.2017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Brown RH, Henderson RJ, Sugar EA, Holbrook JT, Wise RA, on behalf of the American Lung Association Airways Clinical Research Centers. Reproducibility of airway luminal size in asthma measured by HRCT. J Appl Physiol 123: 876-883, 2017. First published July 13, 2017; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00307.2017.-High-resolution CT (HRCT) is a well-established imaging technology used to measure lung and airway morphology in vivo. However, there is a surprising lack of studies examining HRCT reproducibility. The CPAP Trial was a multicenter, randomized, three-parallel-arm, sham-controlled 12-wk clinical trial to assess the use of a nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device on airway reactivity to methacholine. The lack of a treatment effect of CPAP on clinical or HRCT measures provided an opportunity for the current analysis. We assessed the reproducibility of HRCT imaging over 12 wk. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for individual airway segments, individual lung lobes, both lungs, and air trapping. The ICC [95% confidence interval (CI)] for airway luminal size at total lung capacity ranged from 0.95 (0.91, 0.97) to 0.47 (0.27, 0.69). The ICC (95% CI) for airway luminal size at functional residual capacity ranged from 0.91 (0.85, 0.95) to 0.32 (0.11, 0.65). The ICC measurements for airway distensibility index and wall thickness were lower, ranging from poor (0.08) to moderate (0.63) agreement. The ICC for air trapping at functional residual capacity was 0.89 (0.81, 0.94) and varied only modestly by lobe from 0.76 (0.61, 0.87) to 0.95 (0.92, 0.97). In stable well-controlled asthmatic subjects, it is possible to reproducibly image unstimulated airway luminal areas over time, by region, and by size at total lung capacity throughout the lungs. Therefore, any changes in luminal size on repeat CT imaging are more likely due to changes in disease state and less likely due to normal variability. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY There is a surprising lack of studies examining the reproducibility of high-resolution CT in asthma. The current study examined reproducibility of airway measurements. In stable well-controlled asthmatic subjects, it is possible to reproducibly image airway luminal areas over time, by region, and by size at total lung capacity throughout the lungs. Therefore, any changes in luminal size on repeat CT imaging are more likely due to changes in disease state and less likely due to normal variability.

In computation research, full replication is often unrealistic for independent results validation, therefore, study reproduction has been justified as the minimum acceptable standard to evaluate the validity of scientific claims. The application of text mining techniques to citation screening in the context of systematic literature reviews is a relatively young and growing computational field with high relevance for software engineering, medical research and other fields. However, there is little work so far on reproduction studies in the field.; Objective: In this paper, we investigate the reproducibility of studies in this area based on information contained in published articles and we propose reporting guidelines that could improve reproducibility.; Methods: The study was approached in two ways. Initially we attempted to reproduce results from six studies, which were based on the same raw dataset. Then, based on this experience, we identified steps considered essential to successful reproduction of text mining experiments and characterized them to measure how reproducible is a study given the information provided on these steps. 33 articles were systematically assessed for reproducibility using this approach.; Results: Our work revealed that it is currently difficult if not impossible to independently reproduce the results published in any of the studies investigated. The lack of information about the datasets used limits reproducibility of about 80% of the studies assessed. Also, information about the machine learning algorithms is inadequate in about 27% of the papers. On the plus side, the third party software tools used are mostly free and available.; Conclusions: The reproducibility potential of most of the studies can be significantly improved if more attention is paid to information provided on the datasets used, how they were partitioned and utilized, and how any randomization was controlled. We introduce a checklist of information that needs to be provided in order to ensure that a published study can be reproduced. (Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Most patients respond to a standard treatment but the drug may be ineffective or toxic. In this review, we focused on genetic markers of posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) after renal transplantation, a frequent complication of immunosuppressive therapy and important risk factor of graft loss and mortality. An initial literature search identified 100 publications and among them 32 association studies were retrieved under 'Pharmacogenetics and PTDM'. Thirty-five variants in 25 genes with an impact on insulin secretion, disposition or effect were significantly associated with PTDM. The population studied, immunosuppressive regimen, follow-up, PTDM diagnostic and genetic variations tested were highly variable between studies. Although pharmacogenetic biomarkers are key tools of great promise for preventing toxicities and improving event-free survival rates, replication studies are required to select validated biomarkers linked to the occurrence of PTDM and select appropriate immusuppressive treatment to improve renal graft and patient outcome.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28349930&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Izuta, S</author><author>Roberts, J D</author><author>Kunkel, T A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication error rates for G.dGTP, T.dGTP, and A.dGTP mispairs and evidence for differential proofreading by leading and lagging strand DNA replication complexes in human cells.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of biological chemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2595-2600</pages><volume>270</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Deoxyguanine Nucleotides/*genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication/*genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA/genetics</keyword><keyword>HeLa Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes*</keyword><keyword>Templates, Genetic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995-02-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9258</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.270.6.2595</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We have determined the fidelity of DNA replication by human cell extracts in reactions containing excess dGTP. Replication errors were scored using two M13 DNA substrates having the replication origin on opposite sides of the lacZ alpha-complementation gene. The data suggest that the average rates for replication errors resulting from G(template), T.dGTP, and A.dGTP mispairs are 25 x 10(-6), 12 x 10(-6), and 3 x 10(-6), respectively. The data also suggest that error rates for both the (+) and (-) strands differ by less than 2-fold when they are replicated either as the leading or lagging strand. This is in contrast to the 33- and 8-fold differences observed earlier for G.dTTP and C.dTTP mispairs on the (+) strand when replicated by the leading or lagging strand complex (Roberts, J. D., Izuta, S., Thomas, D. C., and Kunkel, T. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1711-1717). Thus, the relative fidelity of the leading and lagging strand replication proteins varies with the mispair and sequence considered. Misincorporation of dGTP preferentially occurs at template positions where dGTP is the next correct nucleotide to be incorporated. This "next nucleotide" effect is characteristic of reduced exonucleolytic proofreading and suggests that these replication errors are normally proofread efficiently. Fidelity measurements performed in the absence or presence of dGMP, an inhibitor of proofreading exonuclease activity, suggest that the leading strand replication complex proofreads some mispairs more efficiently than does the lagging strand replication complex.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=7852323&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, T A</author><author>Tees, D</author><author>Thom, D R</author><author>Hurt, H H, Jr</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation and replication of impact damage to bicycle helmets.</title><secondary-title>Accident; analysis and prevention</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Accident; analysis and prevention</full-title><abbr-1>Accident; analysis and prevention</abbr-1></periodical><pages>795-802</pages><volume>26</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Accidents, Traffic/*statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>Bicycling/*injuries</keyword><keyword>Head Protective Devices*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0001-4575</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0001-4575(94)90055-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A group of 72 impacted bicycle helmets were collected, primarily from manufacturers with a crash replacement policy that encourages the return of damaged helmets. Each damaged helmet was thoroughly inspected and measured to determine the construction details and collision damage. Laboratory replication tests were then performed on selected samples using exemplar helmets to determine impact velocity and peak headform aceleration. The predominant impact location was the front left quarter and the replication studies indicate that the majority of impacts took place on flat surfaces from drop heights of 1 meter or less. Overall, it is evident that a large number of bicycle helmet users who have benefited from the use of a bicycle helmet, and future bicycle helmet standards must incorporate the protective requirements of this unique group.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=7857493&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jayawardene, N</author><author>Riggs, C D</author><author>Hasenkampf, C A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome analysis and replication behavior of a set of repetitive sequences of Lilium longiflorum.</title><secondary-title>Genome</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome</full-title><abbr-1>Genome</abbr-1></periodical><pages>535-541</pages><volume>37</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0831-2796</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/g94-076</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The four clones, pLZH47, pLZ112, pLZ113, and pLZ122, previously assumed to contain DNA sequences that replicate during zygotene (zygDNA), actually had their replication behavior tested using a replication assay.

The number of copies per 2C genome are as follows: pLZH47, 13 500; pLZ112, &gt;100; pLZ113, 200; and pLZ122, 3500. The replication assays measured the amount of hybridizable sequences available at the stage of leptotene (before zygotene DNA replication occurs) and at the stage of pachytene (after zygotene replication occurs). True zygDNA clones should have twice as many sequences to hybridize to at pachytene as at leptotene. None of the clones had the expected increase. One clone, pLZ122, did show a statistically significant increase (10%). It may consist of a mixture of zygDNA and non-zygDNA sequences. Alternatively, only 10% of the pLZ122 family members may function as zygDNA.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18470098&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jeon, Jin Y.</author><author>Fricke, Fergus R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Duration of perceived and performed sounds</title><secondary-title>Psychology of Music</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychology of Music</full-title><abbr-1>Psychology of Music</abbr-1></periodical><pages>70-83</pages><volume>25</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>20â46 yr old musicians &amp; nonmusicians</keyword><keyword>Auditory Discrimination</keyword><keyword>discrimination &amp; reproduction of sound durations</keyword><keyword>Music Perception</keyword><keyword>Musicians</keyword><keyword>Pitch (Frequency)</keyword><keyword>Stimulus Duration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-7356</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0305735697251006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Studied the perception and reproduction of sound durations. Exp 1 studied the duration discrimination in 20 20â46 yr old musicians and nonmusicians, through presentations of standard and comparison sounds. Exp 2 examined the effects of frequency on duration discrimination in 3 musicians experienced in auditory duration judgments, using a pair of high- and low-frequency pure tones. Selection of the longer sound was asked in Exps 1â2. Exp 3 investigated the ability of 3 groups of Ss to perform sounds of different durations, presented with a sound and then made to reproduce the response signal by pressing a button or by playing their own instruments. Sound durations were compared in different reproduction ratios. Results showed that (1) musicians had lower discrimination thresholds than nonmusicians for short stimuli durations; (2) higher frequencies were perceived to have longer duration than lower frequencies; and (3) Ss performed the sounds longer than it should be.

BrdUrd incorporation was measured as a function of cell-cycle position, using an antibody against bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and dual parameter flow cytometric analysis. After exposure to UV light, there was an immediate reduction (approximately 50%) of BrdUrd incorporation in S phase cells, with most of the cells of the population being affected to a similar degree. At 5 h after UV, a population of cells with increased BrdUrd appeared as cells that were in G1 phase at the time of irradiation entered S phase with apparently increased rates of DNA synthesis. For 8 h after UV exposure, incorporation of BrdUrd by the original S phase cells remained constant, whereas a significant portion of original G1 cells possessed rates of BrdUrd incorporation surpassing even those of control cells. Maturation rates of DNA synthesized immediately before or after exposure to UV light, measured by alkaline elution, were similar. Therefore, DNA synthesis measured in the short pulse by anti-BrdUrd fluorescence after exposure to UV light was representative of genomic replication. Anti-BrdUrd measurements after DNA damage provide quantitative and qualitative information of cellular rates of DNA synthesis especially in instances where perturbation of cell-cycle progression is a dominant feature of the damage. In this study, striking differences of subsequent DNA synthesis rates between cells in G1 or S phase at the time of exposure were revealed.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=7694113&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rich, Yisrael</author><author>Kedem, Peri</author><author>Shlesinger, Aviva</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancing intergroup relations among children: A field test of the Miller-Brewer Model</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Intercultural Relations</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Intercultural Relations</full-title><abbr-1>International Journal of Intercultural Relations</abbr-1></periodical><pages>539-553</pages><volume>19</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Conflict Resolution</keyword><keyword>Human Sex Differences</keyword><keyword>intercultural conflict reduction &amp; social acceptance</keyword><keyword>Interpersonal Interaction</keyword><keyword>Israel</keyword><keyword>Judaism</keyword><keyword>Religiosity</keyword><keyword>religious vs secular Jewish 11â13 yr olds</keyword><keyword>sex &amp; interpersonal &amp; task orientation</keyword><keyword>Social Acceptance</keyword><keyword>Social Identity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0147-1767</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0147-1767(95)00035-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Tested N.

Contact between the 2 groups was arranged so as to manipulate decategorization, by teaching academic content with an interpersonal or task orientation. Social acceptance of outgroup children was measured at the 1st session and after 6 wks. At the 10th session generalization was measured. Results comparing the 6th session to the 1st showed an increase in social acceptance towards religious outgroup members among same gender persons only, and for task oriented classes only. Generalization results indicated that the religious ingroup bias, exhibited at the 1st session, was eliminated.

Three errors occurred in the Examples section. The errors are corrected in the erratum, and a more detailed description of the errata can be found on http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0038326.supp (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-21247-001[/rid].) Replication attempts are essential to the empirical sciences. Successful replication attempts increase researchersâ confidence in the presence of an effect, whereas failed replication attempts induce skepticism and doubt. However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attempt results in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes we propose a novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of 2 competing hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic and holds that the effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis that postulates a zero effect size, Hâ : Î´ = 0. The 2nd hypothesis is that of the proponent and holds that the effect is consistent with the one found in the original study, an effect that can be quantified by a posterior distribution. Hence, the 2nd hypothesisâthe replication hypothesisâis given by Hr : Î´ â¼ 'posterior distribution from original study.' The weighted-likelihood ratio between Hâ and Hr quantifies the evidence that the data provide for replication success and failure. In addition to the new test, we present several other Bayesian tests that address different but related questions concerning a replication study. These tests pertain to the independent conclusions of the separate experiments, the difference in effect size between the original experiment and the replication attempt, and the overall conclusion based on the pooled results. Together, this suite of Bayesian tests allows a relatively complete formalization of the way in which the result of a replication attempt alters our knowledge of the phenomenon at hand. The use of all Bayesian replication tests is illustrated with 3 examples from the literature. For experiments analyzed using the t test, computation of the new replication test only requires the t values and the numbers of participants from the original study and the replication study.

It has been identified that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells only in the thymus of patients with MG regardless of the thymic pathology. EBV is unique in its ability to latently infect and immortalize B cells, which may provide an explanation for why EBV has been suggested as having a pathogenic role in several autoimmune disorders with diverse effector arms, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis etc. The expression pattern of latent EBV genes observed in intrathymic B cells of patients resembles the pattern characteristic for B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) immortalized by EBV in vitro. EBV is capable of establishing persistent infection without detriment to the host. Switching on lytic, productive EBV replication may result, however, in new infection events and EBV-associated cell transformation/immortalization events, even at ectopic sites like the thymus. EBV infection of the thymus proves to be common among patients with MG. The viral rate of replication is likely extremely low, and the presently available antivirals are poorly effective at eradicating acute infections and therefore unlikely to be worthwhile treatments for chronic autoimmune disorders induced by EBV.

This study aimed at developing and validating continuous measures of asthma severity in adult patients with ever asthma from the general population, to be used in epidemiological studies.; Methods: Respiratory symptoms, anti-asthmatic treatment and lung function were measured on 520 patients with ever asthma aged 20-64 years from the general Italian population (GEIRD study; 2007/2010). The variables that represent the same dimension of asthma severity were identified through an exploratory factor analysis and were summarized through a multiple factor analysis.; Results: Only respiratory symptoms and anti-asthmatic treatment were summarized in a continuous score (STS). STS ranges from 0 (no symptoms/treatment) to 10 (maximum symptom frequency and treatment intensity). STS was positively correlated with the Global Initiative for Asthma classification of asthma severity computed on the 137 cases with a doctor's diagnosis (Spearman's coefficient = 0.61, p-value&lt;0.0001) (concurrent validity). Furthermore, using a cohort of 1,097 European asthmatics (ECRHS II study; 1999/2002), increasing STS levels at baseline (1991/1993) were positively associated with long-term outcomes (hospitalization and lost workdays for breathing problems, asthma attack frequency and use of asthma controllers) (predictive validity). Finally, the STS scores computed from the GEIRD and ECRHS II data were comparable (Lin's coefficient = 0.95, p-value&lt;0.0001) (replication analysis).; Conclusions: STS is a valid and replicable measure of asthma severity in adults, which could be used in association studies.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28542217&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eaton, Heather E</author><author>Kobayashi, Takeshi</author><author>Dermody, Terence S</author><author>Johnston, Randal N</author><author>Jais, Philippe H</author><author>Shmulevitz, Maya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>African Swine Fever Virus NP868R Capping Enzyme Promotes Reovirus Rescue during Reverse Genetics by Promoting Reovirus Protein Expression, Virion Assembly, and RNA Incorporation into Infectious Virions.</title><secondary-title>Journal of virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of virology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of virology</abbr-1></periodical><volume>91</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>African Swine Fever Virus/*enzymology</keyword><keyword>African Swine Fever Virus/genetics</keyword><keyword>C3P3</keyword><keyword>capping</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>NP868R</keyword><keyword>Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Orthoreovirus, Mammalian/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Orthoreovirus, Mammalian/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism</keyword><keyword>reovirus</keyword><keyword>reverse genetics</keyword><keyword>Reverse Genetics</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Virion/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Virion/genetics</keyword><keyword>Virus Assembly*</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-05-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1098-5514</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JVI.02416-16</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reoviruses, like many eukaryotic viruses, contain an inverted 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap linked to the 5' nucleotide of mRNA. The traditional functions of capping are to promote mRNA stability, protein translation, and concealment from cellular proteins that recognize foreign RNA. To address the role of mRNA capping during reovirus replication, we assessed the benefits of adding the African swine fever virus NP868R capping enzyme during reovirus rescue. C3P3, a fusion protein containing T7 RNA polymerase and NP868R, was found to increase protein expression 5- to 10-fold compared to T7 RNA polymerase alone while enhancing reovirus rescue from the current reverse genetics system by 100-fold. Surprisingly, RNA stability was not increased by C3P3, suggesting a direct effect on protein translation. A time course analysis revealed that C3P3 increased protein synthesis within the first 2 days of a reverse genetics transfection. This analysis also revealed that C3P3 enhanced processing of outer capsid Î¼1 protein to Î¼1C, a previously described hallmark of reovirus assembly. Finally, to determine the rate of infectious-RNA incorporation into new virions, we developed a new recombinant reovirus S1 gene that expressed the fluorescent protein UnaG. Following transfection of cells with UnaG and infection with wild-type virus, passage of UnaG through progeny was significantly enhanced by C3P3. These data suggest that capping provides nontraditional functions to reovirus, such as promoting assembly and infectious-RNA incorporation. IMPORTANCE Our findings expand our understanding of how viruses utilize capping, suggesting that capping provides nontraditional functions to reovirus, such as promoting assembly and infectious-RNA incorporation, in addition to enhancing protein translation. Beyond providing mechanistic insight into reovirus replication, our findings also show that reovirus reverse genetics rescue is enhanced 100-fold by the NP868R capping enzyme. Since reovirus shows promise as a cancer therapy, efficient reovirus reverse genetics rescue will accelerate production of recombinant reoviruses as candidates to enhance therapeutic potency. NP868R-assisted reovirus rescue will also expedite production of recombinant reovirus for mechanistic insights into reovirus protein function and structure.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied in association with motor skill learning has been investigated as a tool for enhancing training effects in health and disease. Here, we review the published literature investigating whether tDCS can facilitate the acquisition, retention or adaptation of motor skills. Work in multiple laboratories is underway to develop a mechanistic understanding of tDCS effects on different forms of learning and to optimize stimulation protocols. Efforts are required to improve reproducibility and standardization. Overall, reproducibility remains to be fully tested, effect sizes with present techniques vary over a wide range, and the basis of observed inter-individual variability in tDCS effects is incompletely understood. It is recommended that future studies explicitly state in the Methods the exploratory (hypothesis-generating) or hypothesis-driven (confirmatory) nature of the experimental designs. General research practices could be improved with prospective pre-registration of hypothesis-based investigations, more emphasis on the detailed description of methods (including all pertinent details to enable future modeling of induced current and experimental replication), and use of post-publication open data repositories. A checklist is proposed for reporting tDCS investigations in a way that can improve efforts to assess reproducibility. (Copyright Â© 2017.

Multilocus associaton methods may reduce the genetic heterogeneity and improve the probability of replication between analyses. The aims of our study were twofold: 1. To analyse genetic risk factors of schizophrenia by using multilocus genetic tests. 2. To assess the replication probability attributable to the various multilocus tests.; Methods: Subjects - Discovery set: case-parent trios of unaffected parents and affected probands with a DSM-IV schizophrenia diagnosis (n=16); replication set: schizophrenia cases and unaffected controls (n=5337). Associations of single nucleotide and indel markers were transferred to gene- and geneset-based associations, furthermore to geneset-enrichment tests and functional annotation cluster analyses in a two-staged designs. Associations with p&lt;0.1 from the discovery set were tested in the replication sample. Familywise p-value correction for multiple comparisons were performed during the replication step.; Results: After correction for multiplicity, no significant association or enrichment were detected for gene-based nor canonical pathway analyses, but significant association of the 14q31 cytoband and enrichments of the 5q31 and Xq13 cytobands were found (p&amp;#95;corr: 0.002, 0.006 and 0.048, respectively). Functional annotation clustering yielded statistically significant enrichment scores for clusters of splicing/alternative splicing, neurodevelopment and embryonic development. Improvements in replication probability were found with increased test complexity (P&amp;#95;rep: 0, 0.015, 0.21).; Conclusion: Our results corroborate the involvement of neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and immune mechanisms in the etiology of schizophrenia. Also, our findings indicated improvement of replication probability by using multilocus genetic analyses.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29870616&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jacobs, Evan S</author><author>Keating, Sheila M</author><author>Abdel-Mohsen, Mohamed</author><author>Gibb, Stuart L</author><author>Heitman, John W</author><author>Inglis, Heather C</author><author>Martin, Jeffrey N</author><author>Zhang, Jinbing</author><author>Kaidarova, Zhanna</author><author>Deng, Xutao</author><author>Wu, Shiquan</author><author>Anastos, Kathryn</author><author>Crystal, Howard</author><author>Villacres, Maria C</author><author>Young, Mary</author><author>Greenblatt, Ruth M</author><author>Landay, Alan L</author><author>Gange, Stephen J</author><author>Deeks, Steven G</author><author>Golub, Elizabeth T</author><author>Pillai, Satish K</author><author>Norris, Philip J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytokines Elevated in HIV Elite Controllers Reduce HIV Replication In Vitro and Modulate HIV Restriction Factor Expression.</title><secondary-title>Journal of virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of virology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of virology</abbr-1></periodical><volume>91</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology</keyword><keyword>chemokine receptors</keyword><keyword>cytokines</keyword><keyword>Cytokines/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>elite control</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>HIV</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections/*immunology</keyword><keyword>HIV Long-Term Survivors</keyword><keyword>HIV/*immunology</keyword><keyword>HIV/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Plasma/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Receptors, HIV/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>restriction factor</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/*drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-02-28</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1098-5514</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JVI.02051-16</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A subset of HIV-infected individuals termed elite controllers (ECs) maintain CD4 + T cell counts and control viral replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Systemic cytokine responses may differentiate ECs from subjects with uncontrolled viral replication or from those who require ART to suppress viral replication. We measured 87 cytokines in four groups of women: 73 ECs, 42 with pharmacologically suppressed viremia (ART), 42 with uncontrolled viral replication (noncontrollers [NCs]), and 48 HIV-uninfected (NEG) subjects. Four cytokines were elevated in ECs but not NCs or ART subjects: CCL14, CCL21, CCL27, and XCL1. In addition, median stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) levels were 43% higher in ECs than in NCs. The combination of the five cytokines suppressed R5 and X4 virus replication in resting CD4 + T cells, and individually SDF-1Î², CCL14, and CCL27 suppressed R5 virus replication, while SDF-1Î², CCL21, and CCL14 suppressed X4 virus replication. Functional studies revealed that the combination of the five cytokines upregulated CD69 and CCR5 and downregulated CXCR4 and CCR7 on CD4 + T cells. The CD69 and CXCR4 effects were driven by SDF-1, while CCL21 downregulated CCR7. The combination of the EC-associated cytokines induced expression of the anti-HIV host restriction factors IFITM1 and IFITM2 and suppressed expression of RNase L and SAMHD1. These results identify a set of cytokines that are elevated in ECs and define their effects on cellular activation, HIV coreceptor expression, and innate restriction factor expression. This cytokine pattern may be a signature characteristic of HIV-1 elite control, potentially important for HIV therapeutic and curative strategies. IMPORTANCE Approximately 1% of people infected with HIV control virus replication without taking antiviral medications. These subjects, termed elite controllers (ECs), are known to have stronger immune responses targeting HIV than the typical HIV-infected subject, but the exact mechanisms of how their immune responses control infection are not known. In this study, we identified five soluble immune signaling molecules (cytokines) in the blood that were higher in ECs than in subjects with typical chronic HIV infection. We demonstrated that these cytokines can activate CD4 + T cells, the target cells for HIV infection. Furthermore, these five EC-associated cytokines could change expression levels of intrinsic resistance factors, or molecules inside the target cell that fight HIV infection. This study is significant in that it identified cytokines elevated in subjects with a good immune response against HIV and defined potential mechanisms as to how these cytokines could induce resistance to the virus in target cells.

Though the host shutoff may facilitate reallocation of cellular resources for viral replication and evasion of host antiviral immune responses, it poses a challenge for continuous synthesis of cellular proteins that are important for viral replication. It is, however, unclear whether and how certain cellular proteins may be selectively synthesized during the vaccinia virus-induced host shutoff. Using simultaneous RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling, two techniques quantifying genome-wide levels of mRNA and active protein translation, respectively, we analyzed the responses of host cells to vaccinia virus infection at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The analyses showed that cellular mRNA depletion played a dominant role in the shutoff of host protein synthesis. Though the cellular mRNAs were significantly reduced, the relative translation efficiency of a subset of cellular mRNAs increased, particularly those involved in oxidative phosphorylation that are responsible for cellular energy production. Further experiments demonstrated that the protein levels and activities of oxidative phosphorylation increased during vaccinia virus infection, while inhibition of the cellular oxidative phosphorylation function significantly suppressed vaccinia virus replication. Moreover, the short 5' untranslated region of the oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs contributed to the translational upregulation. These results provide evidence of a mechanism that couples translational control and energy metabolism, two processes that all viruses depend on host cells to provide, to support vaccinia virus replication during a host shutoff. IMPORTANCE Many viral infections cause global host protein synthesis shutoff. While host protein synthesis shutoff benefits the virus by relocating cellular resources to viral replication, it also poses a challenge to the maintenance of cellular functions necessary for viral replication if continuous protein synthesis is required. Here we measured the host mRNA translation rate during a vaccinia virus-induced host shutoff by analyzing total and actively translating mRNAs in a genome-wide manner. This study revealed that oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs were translationally upregulated during vaccinia virus-induced host protein synthesis shutoff. Oxidative phosphorylation is the major cellular energy-producing pathway, and we further showed that maintenance of its function is important for vaccinia virus replication. This study highlights the fact that vaccinia virus infection can enhance cellular energy production through translational upregulation in the context of an overall host protein synthesis shutoff to meet energy expenditure.

We tested a total of 3.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as imputed HLA alleles and amino acids.

The most significant HLA association was the previously reported amino acid variant located at position 71, within the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRB1 (PÂ =Â 2Â ÃÂ 10 -4 ). Our study therefore reproduced previous findings for the association between peanut allergy and HLA-DRB1 in this Australian population.; Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Genetic determinants for challenge-proven peanut allergy include alleles at the HLA-DRB1 locus.

Although several environmental risk factors for respiratory symptoms are known, knowledge on genetic risk factors is lacking. We aim to identify genetic variants associated with respiratory symptoms by genome-wide association (GWA) analyses.; Methods: We conducted the first GWA study on cough, dyspnea and phlegm among 7,976 participants in the LifeLines I cohort and used the LifeLines II cohort (nâ=â5,260) and the Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen cohort (nâ=â1,529) for replication.; Results: We identified 50 SNPs that were assessed for replication. Rs16918212, located in the alpha-2-macroglobulin pseudogene 1 (A2MP1), was associated with cough in both the identification (odds ratio (OR)â=â0.72, pâ=â5.41âÃâ10 -5 ) and the meta-analyzed replication cohorts (ORâ=â0.83, pâ=Â 0.033). No other significant replicated associations were found.; Conclusions: Given that only 1 out of 50 SNPs showed significant replication (i.e. 2%) we conclude that we did not find a convincing association between genetic markers and respiratory symptoms. Since, environmental exposures are important risk factors for respiratory symptoms, the next step is to perform a genome-wide interaction (GWI) study to identify genetic susceptibility loci for respiratory symptoms in interaction with known harmful environmental exposures.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28073367&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MunafÃ², Marcus R</author><author>Nosek, Brian A</author><author>Bishop, Dorothy V M</author><author>Button, Katherine S</author><author>Chambers, Christopher D</author><author>du Sert, Nathalie Percie</author><author>Simonsohn, Uri</author><author>Wagenmakers, Eric-Jan</author><author>Ware, Jennifer J</author><author>Ioannidis, John P A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A manifesto for reproducible science.</title><secondary-title>Nature human behaviour</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature human behaviour</full-title><abbr-1>Nature human behaviour</abbr-1></periodical><pages>0021</pages><volume>1</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-01-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2397-3374</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41562-016-0021</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Improving the reliability and efficiency of scientific research will increase the credibility of the published scientific literature and accelerate discovery.

We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.; Competing Interests: Competing interests M.R.M, together with C.D.C and D.V.M.B., has received funding from the BBSRC (grant number BB/N019660/1) to convene a workshop on advanced methods for reproducible science, and is chair of the CHDI Foundation Independent Statistical Standing Committee.

The development of recombinant viruses is of utmost importance for several types of studies, such as those aimed to dissect virus-host interactions and to search for novel antiviral strategies. Moreover, recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes may greatly facilitate these studies. Here, we report the construction of a recombinant yellow fever virus (YFV) expressing Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) (YFV-GLuc). We show, through RT-PCR, sequencing and measurement of GLuc activity, that stability of the heterologous gene was maintained after six passages. Furthermore, a direct association between GLuc expression and viral replication was observed (r2=0.9967), indicating that measurement of GLuc activity may be used to assess viral replication in different applications. In addition, we evaluated the use of the recombinant virus in an antiviral assay with recombinant human alfa-2b interferon. A 60% inhibition of GLuc expression was observed in cells infected with YFV-GLuc and incubated with IFN alfa-2b. Previously tested on YFV inhibition by plaque assays indicated a similar fold-decrease in viral replication. These results are valuable as they show the stability of YFV-GLuc and one of several possible applications of this construct.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28746549&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Steere, Daniel E.</author><author>Strauch, James D.</author><author>Powell, Thomas H.</author><author>Butterworth, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Promoting generalization from a teaching setting to a community-based setting among persons with severe disabilities: A general case programming approach</title><secondary-title>Education and Treatment of Children</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Education and Treatment of Children</full-title><abbr-1>Education and Treatment of Children</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5-20</pages><volume>13</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Academic Environment</keyword><keyword>general case programing of motor skills in teaching environment</keyword><keyword>Generalization (Learning)</keyword><keyword>generalization to community setting</keyword><keyword>Intellectual Development Disorder</keyword><keyword>mentally retarded 15â17 yr olds</keyword><keyword>Motor Skills</keyword><keyword>Social Environments</keyword><keyword>Teaching Methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0748-8491</isbn><abstract>Used general case programming (GCP) procedures in a structured teaching environment to teach 2 skills used in community fast-food restaurants to 3 adolescents (aged 15, 16, and 17 yrs) with severe disabilities.

Any study describing predefined pathology findings, comparison to another radiographic technique, or a measure of reproducibility was included with no limitation by disease state.; Results: We identified 44 studies meeting inclusion criteria from the 1901 articles identified by our search. All 44 reported on pathology findings, including erosions (n = 31), bone microarchitecture (n = 10) and bone mineral density (n = 10) variables, joint space evaluation (n = 7), or osteophyte characterization (n = 7). Seventeen of the studies compared HR-pQCT findings to either plain radiography (n = 9), ultrasound (n = 4), magnetic resonance imaging (n = 5), or microcomputed tomography (n = 2), with HR-pQCT having high sensitivity for erosion detection. Twenty-four studies included an assessment of reproducibility with good to excellent metrics, and highlighting the critical importance of positioning when assessing joint space variables.; Conclusion: Despite high sensitivity for erosion detection and good reproducibility, more research is required to determine where HR-pQCT can be applied to enhance our understanding of periarticular bone changes in a variety of arthritis conditions.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27698107&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Erdemir, Ahmet</author><author>Guess, Trent M</author><author>Halloran, Jason P</author><author>Modenese, Luca</author><author>Reinbolt, Jeffrey A</author><author>Thelen, Darryl G</author><author>Umberger, Brian R</author><author>Erdemir, Ahmet</author><author>Guess, Trent M</author><author>Halloran, Jason P</author><author>Modenese, Luca</author><author>Reinbolt, Jeffrey A</author><author>Thelen, Darryl G</author><author>Umberger, Brian R</author><author>Umberger, Brian R</author><author>Erdemir, Ahmet</author><author>Thelen, Darryl G</author><author>Guess, Trent M</author><author>Reinbolt, Jeffrey A</author><author>Modenese, Luca</author><author>Halloran, Jason P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Commentary on the integration of model sharing and reproducibility analysis to scholarly publishing workflow in computational biomechanics.</title><secondary-title>IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2080-2085</pages><volume>63</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Biomedical Engineering*/methods</keyword><keyword>Biomedical Engineering*/organization &amp; administration</keyword><keyword>Biomedical Engineering*/standards</keyword><keyword>Cooperative Behavior*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Information Dissemination*</keyword><keyword>Models, Theoretical*</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1558-2531</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TBME.2016.2602760</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: The overall goal of this paper is to demonstrate that dissemination of models and analyses for assessing the reproducibility of simulation results can be incorporated in the scientific review process in biomechanics.; Methods: As part of a special issue on model sharing and reproducibility in the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, two manuscripts on computational biomechanics were submitted: Rajagopal et al., IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016 and Schmitz and Piovesan, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016. Models used in these studies were shared with the scientific reviewers and the public. In addition to the standard review of the manuscripts, the reviewers downloaded the models and performed simulations that reproduced results reported in the studies.; Results: There was general agreement between simulation results of the authors and those of the reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved during the necessary revisions. The manuscripts and instructions for download and simulation were updated in response to the reviewers' feedback; changes that may otherwise have been missed if explicit model sharing and simulation reproducibility analysis was not conducted in the review process. Increased burden on the authors and the reviewers, to facilitate model sharing and to repeat simulations, were noted.; Conclusion: When the authors of computational biomechanics studies provide access to models and data, the scientific reviewers can download and thoroughly explore the model, perform simulations, and evaluate simulation reproducibility beyond the traditional manuscript-only review process.; Significance: Model sharing and reproducibility analysis in scholarly publishing will result in a more rigorous review process, which will enhance the quality of modeling and simulation studies and inform future users of computational models.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28072567&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koffel, Jonathan B</author><author>Rethlefsen, Melissa L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility of Search Strategies Is Poor in Systematic Reviews Published in High-Impact Pediatrics, Cardiology and Surgery Journals: A Cross-Sectional Study.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title><abbr-1>PloS one</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e0163309</pages><volume>11</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-09-26</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0163309</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: A high-quality search strategy is considered an essential component of systematic reviews but many do not contain reproducible search strategies. It is unclear if low reproducibility spans medical disciplines, is affected by librarian/search specialist involvement or has improved with increased awareness of reporting guidelines.; Objectives: To examine the reporting of search strategies in systematic reviews published in Pediatrics, Surgery or Cardiology journals in 2012 and determine rates and predictors of including a reproducible search strategy.; Methods: We identified all systematic reviews published in 2012 in the ten highest impact factor journals in Pediatrics, Surgery and Cardiology. Each search strategy was coded to indicate what elements were reported and whether the overall search was reproducible. Reporting and reproducibility rates were compared across disciplines and we measured the influence of librarian/search specialist involvement, discipline or endorsement of a reporting guideline on search reproducibility.; Results: 272 articles from 25 journals were included. Reporting of search elements ranged widely from 91% of articles naming search terms to 33% providing a full search strategy and 22% indicating the date the search was executed. Only 22% of articles provided at least one reproducible search strategy and 13% provided a reproducible strategy for all databases searched in the article. Librarians or search specialists were reported as involved in 17% of articles. There were strong disciplinary differences on the reporting of search elements. In the multivariable analysis, only discipline (Pediatrics) was a significant predictor of the inclusion of a reproducible search strategy.; Conclusions: Despite recommendations to report full, reproducible search strategies, many articles still do not. In addition, authors often report a single strategy as covering all databases searched, further decreasing reproducibility. Further research is needed to determine how disciplinary culture may encourage reproducibility and the role that journal editors and peer reviewers could play.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27669416&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Li</author><author>Boland, Mary Regina</author><author>Miotto, Riccardo</author><author>Tatonetti, Nicholas P</author><author>Dudley, Joel T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replicating Cardiovascular Condition-Birth Month Associations.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title><abbr-1>Scientific reports</abbr-1></periodical><pages>33166</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Databases, Factual*</keyword><keyword>Electronic Health Records*</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Parturition*</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Seasons*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-09-14</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2045-2322</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep33166</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Independent replication is vital for study findings drawn from Electronic Health Records (EHR). This replication study evaluates the relationship between seasonal effects at birth and lifetime cardiovascular condition risk. We performed a Season-wide Association Study on 1,169,599 patients from Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) to compute phenome-wide associations between birth month and CVD. We then evaluated if seasonal patterns found at MSH matched those reported at Columbia University Medical Center. Coronary arteriosclerosis, essential hypertension, angina, and pre-infarction syndrome passed phenome-wide significance and their seasonal patterns matched those previously reported. Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and chronic myocardial ischemia had consistent patterns but were not phenome-wide significant. We confirm that CVD risk peaks for those born in the late winter/early spring among the evaluated patient populations. The replication findings bolster evidence for a seasonal birth month effect in CVD.

It is a multiple antibiotic resistance plasmid frequently detected in clinical Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium strains. Replication of pIP501 proceeds unidirectionally by a theta mechanism. The minimal replicon of pIP501 is composed of the repR gene encoding the essential rate-limiting replication initiator protein RepR and the origin of replication, oriR, located downstream of repR. RepR is similar to RepE of related streptococcal plasmid pAMÎ²1, which has been shown to possess RNase activity cleaving free RNA molecules in close proximity of the initiation site of DNA synthesis. Replication of pIP501 is controlled by the concerted action of a small protein, CopR, and an antisense RNA, RNAIII. CopR has a dual function: It acts as transcriptional repressor at the repR promoter and, in addition, prevents convergent transcription of RNAIII and repR mRNA (RNAII), which indirectly increases RNAIII synthesis. CopR binds asymmetrically as a dimer at two consecutive binding sites upstream of and overlapping with the repR promoter. RNAIII induces transcriptional attenuation within the leader region of the repR mRNA (RNAII). Deletion of either control component causes a 10- to 20-fold increase of plasmid copy number, while simultaneous deletions have no additional effect. Conjugative transfer of pIP501 depends on a type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded in a single operon. Its transfer host-range is considerably broad, as it has been transferred to virtually all Gram-positive bacteria including Streptomyces and even the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Expression of the 15 genes encoding the T4SS is tightly controlled by binding of the relaxase TraA, the transfer initiator protein, to the operon promoter overlapping with the origin of transfer (oriT). The T4SS operon encodes the DNA-binding proteins TraJ (VirD4-like coupling protein) and the VirB4-like ATPase, TraE. Both proteins are actively involved in conjugative DNA transport. Moreover, the operon encodes TraN, a small cytoplasmic protein, whose specific binding to a sequence upstream of the oriT nic-site was demonstrated. TraN seems to be an effective repressor of pIP501 transfer, as conjugative transfer rates were significantly increased in an E. faecalis pIP501ÎtraN mutant.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27563645&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rose, N</author><author>Andraud, M</author><author>Bigault, L</author><author>Jestin, A</author><author>Grasland, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A commercial PCV2a-based vaccine significantly reduces PCV2b transmission in experimental conditions.</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title><abbr-1>Vaccine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3738-3745</pages><volume>34</volume><number>33</number><issue>33</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Viral/blood</keyword><keyword>Circoviridae Infections/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Circoviridae Infections/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Circoviridae Infections/transmission</keyword><keyword>Circovirus</keyword><keyword>Immunity, Humoral</keyword><keyword>Porcine Circovirus type 2</keyword><keyword>Reproduction number</keyword><keyword>Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms</keyword><keyword>Sus scrofa</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/transmission</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/virology</keyword><keyword>Transmission</keyword><keyword>Vaccination</keyword><keyword>Viral Vaccines/*immunology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-07-19</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1873-2518</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.06.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Transmission characteristics of PCV2 have been compared between vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs in experimental conditions. Twenty-four Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) piglets, vaccinated against PCV2 at 3weeks of age (PCV2a recombinant CAP protein-based vaccine), were inoculated at 15days post-vaccination with a PCV2b inoculum (6â10(5) TCID50), and put in contact with 24 vaccinated SPF piglets during 42days post-inoculation. Those piglets were shared in six replicates of a contact trial involving 4 inoculated piglets mingled with 4 susceptible SPF piglets. Two replicates of a similar contact trial were made with non-vaccinated pigs. Non vaccinated animals received a placebo at vaccination time and were inoculated the same way and at the same time as the vaccinated group. All the animals were monitored twice weekly using quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA for serology until 42days post-inoculation. The frequency of infection and the PCV2 genome load in sera of the vaccinated pigs were significantly reduced compared to the non-vaccinated animals. The duration of infectiousness was significantly different between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups (16.6days [14.7;18.4] and 26.6days [22.9;30.4] respectively). The transmission rate was also considerably decreased in vaccinated pigs (Î²=0.09 [0.05-0.14] compared to Î²=0.19 [0.11-0.32] in non-vaccinated pigs). This led to an estimated reproduction ratio of 1.5 [95% CI 0.8 - 2.2] in vaccinated animals versus 5.1 [95% CI 2.5 - 8.2] in non-vaccinated pigs when merging data of this experiment with previous trials carried out in same conditions.

While a variety of potential replacement therapies are being explored, expansion of endogenous insulin-producing pancreatic islet Î²-cells remains an attractive strategy. Î²-cells have limited spontaneous regenerative activity; consequently, a crucial research effort is to develop a precise understanding of the molecular pathways that restrain Î²-cell growth and to identify drugs capable of overcoming these restraints. Herein an automated high-content image-based primary-cell screening method to identify Î²-cell replication-promoting small molecules is presented. Several, limitations of prior methodologies are surmounted. First, use of primary islet cells rather than an immortalized cell-line maximizes retention of in vivo growth restraints. Second, use of mixed-composition islet-cell cultures rather than a Î²-cell-line allows identification of both lineage-restricted and general growth stimulators. Third, the technique makes practical the use of primary islets, a limiting resource, through use of a 384-well format. Fourth, detrimental experimental variability associated with erratic islet culture quality is overcome through optimization of isolation, dispersion, plating and culture parameters. Fifth, the difficulties of accurately and consistently measuring the low basal replication rate of islet endocrine-cells are surmounted with optimized immunostaining parameters, automated data acquisition and data analysis; automation simultaneously enhances throughput and limits experimenter bias. Notable limitations of this assay are the use of dispersed islet cultures which disrupts islet architecture, the use of rodent rather than human islets and the inherent limitations of throughput and cost associated with the use of primary cells. Importantly, the strategy is easily adapted for human islet replication studies. This assay is well suited for investigating the mitogenic effect of substances on Î²-cells and the molecular mechanisms that regulate Î²-cell growth.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27500720&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsuzuki, Yuji</author><author>Watanabe, Tsunamasa</author><author>Iio, Etsuko</author><author>Fujisaki, Seiichiro</author><author>Ibe, Shiro</author><author>Kani, Satomi</author><author>Hamada-Tsutsumi, Susumu</author><author>Yokomaku, Yoshiyuki</author><author>Iwatani, Yasumasa</author><author>Sugiura, Wataru</author><author>Okuse, Chiaki</author><author>Okumura, Akihiko</author><author>Sato, Yoshihisa</author><author>Tanaka, Yasuhito</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Virological characteristics of hepatitis B genotype G/A2 recombination virus in Japan.</title><secondary-title>Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology</full-title><abbr-1>Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>775-783</pages><volume>46</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>chimeric mice</keyword><keyword>co-infection</keyword><keyword>genotype A</keyword><keyword>genotype G/A recombination</keyword><keyword>hepatitis B virus</keyword><keyword>men who have sex with men</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1386-6346</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/hepr.12612</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aim: We identified four cases of infection with hepatitis B virus genotype G and A2 recombinant (HBV/G/A2) strains, which were initially overlooked by enzyme immunoassay-based genotyping. The patients were all men who have sex with men (MSM) and inhabited several metropolitan areas of Japan, suggesting that the recombinant strains may be circulating among high-risk groups such as MSM. Here, we investigated the genomic structure and virological properties of the HBV/G/A2 strains.; Methods: Complete genome sequences of the isolates were determined and phylogenetically analyzed. Replication efficiency of HBV/G/A2 was investigated by transfecting plasmids containing 1.24-fold viral genome. The in vivo viral kinetics of HBV/G/A2 were investigated using chimeric mice with humanized livers.; Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the four strains were almost identical (&gt;99.7% homologous). The preS2/S region of these strains was highly homologous to that of genotype A2 and the remaining region was almost identical to that of genotype G, reflecting inter-genotypic recombination. Interestingly, in all four cases, genotype A was co-infected as a minor population. In vitro analysis revealed that HBV/G/A2 had a low replication rate. Although detectable viremia was not measurable following the inoculation of HBV/G/A2 into chimeric mice, subsequent superinfection of HBV genotype A greatly enhanced HBV/G/A2 replication and viral spread.; Conclusion: We found that four cases of HBV/G/A2 recombinant among MSM patients in the metropolitan areas of Japan, and HBV/A co-infections are required for its efficient replication. High-risk groups such as MSM should be carefully tested for infection of genotype G-derived variants.

Asexual blood stages of the causative agent of the most virulent form of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, can be cultivated indefinitely in vitro in human erythrocytes, facilitating experimental analysis of parasite cell biology, biochemistry and genetics. However, efforts to improve understanding of the basic biology of this important pathogen and to develop urgently required new antimalarial drugs and vaccines, suffer from a paucity of basic research tools. This includes a simple means of quantifying the effects of drugs, antibodies and gene modifications on parasite fitness and replication rates. Here we describe the development and validation of an extremely simple, robust plaque assay that can be used to visualise parasite replication and resulting host erythrocyte destruction at the level of clonal parasite populations. We demonstrate applications of the plaque assay by using it for the phenotypic characterisation of two P. falciparum conditional mutants displaying reduced fitness in vitro.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27332706&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scheffer, Russell E.</author><author>Kowatch, Robert A.</author><author>Carmody, Thomas</author><author>Rush, A.

Sheffer et al respond to five points. 1) The doses of mixed amphetamine salts were not ineffective. In fact, the study revealed efficacy for mixed amphetamine salts for the doses used compared to placebo. It is true that higher doses might have been even more effective. 2) They agree that higher doses of divalproex might have led to even greater benefits, although the doses and serum levels used were associated with a substantial rate of response of 80%. 3) and 4) They agree that the small group size and a study conducted at only one site, by definition, limited generalizability and also recommend replication studies. However, they demonstrated strong statistical significance with the group they used. 5) Sheffer et al agree that longer-term studies are needed to best evaluate long-term safety and outcome. They certainly believe that this first study should be followed by larger, more definitive controlled trials to better assess generalizability and tolerability in a larger group.

Target behaviors involving a verbal action or reaction within 6 skill areas were taught, using a commercially available board game and a specially designed card deck. The training program featured response-specific feedback, self-monitoring, individualized reinforcers, and individualized performance criterion levels. Results show that game contingencies increased social/vocational skills in all targeted areas. Generalization was assessed in 2 settings: a simulated workshop, in which pre- and postmeasures were taken, and the institutional workshop, where Ss worked. Posttraining simulated workshop results reveal that the Ss' newly learned skills had generalized. However, repeated generalization measures of Ss' social interactions in the institutional workshop were equivocal, as were measures of their productivity.

Three LD high school students' social skills were observed in 2 situations before and after training: contrived but unobtrusive situations in the Ss' natural environment and novel role-playing situations. LD Ss did not automatically generalize recently learned social skills to novel role-playing situations and the natural environment. High performance in a novel role-playing situation did not necessarily indicate that Ss showed a correspondingly high performance in the natural environment. Consequently, LD adolescents must be trained to generalize newly learned social skills, and generalization of newly learned social skills should be measured in the learner's natural environment.

The factor structure was more clearly defined than in the original normative study, and a primary factor of Hyperactivity emerged, accounting for 39% of the variance. Six factors with eigenvalues of 1.00 or more accounted for 69% of the variance. Hyperactivity and Conduct factors, which are consistent over multiple studies, emerged. Items consistent with inattentive, unsociable, and passive behavior also separated into discrete factors. This suggests that using a mixed clinical population produces a clearer delineation of factors, which may provide the basis for subtyping a clinical population.

Six typical preschool children (aged 3 yrs 3 mo to 4 yrs 8 mo) who did not recall and recognize the training words served as Ss. An individual analysis design was used in which all the Ss were taught all words, counterbalanced across the 3 reading procedures. All reading procedures were tailored to allow for the same number of training responses while using the identical modeling, imitation, and reinforcement technique. Results show that the sight procedure took the fewest training sessions to acquisition with the smallest number of errors, in comparison with syllable and phonics. However, all words, regardless of the type of training, were maintained equally well. Considering the generalization measures, each procedure had unique advantages. Therefore, it is speculated how the 3 procedures might be combined for the beginning reader.

Without effective vaccines being available, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends the full depopulation of infected herds as the only strategy to eradicate B. suis outbreaks. Using data collected from 8 herds suffering natural swine brucellosis outbreaks, we assessed the efficacy of four control strategies: (i) oxytetracycline treatment only, as a default scenario, (ii) oxytetracycline treatment combined with skin testing and removal of positive animals, (iii) oxytetracycline treatment combined with serological testing (Rose Bengal test-RBT-and indirect ELISA -iELISA-) and removal of seropositive animals and (iv) oxytetracycline treatment combined with both serological (RBT/iELISA) and skin testing and removal of positive animals. A Susceptible-Infectious-Removal model was used to estimate the reproduction ratio (R) for each strategy. According to this model, the oxytetracycline treatment alone was not effective enough to eradicate the infection. However, this antibiotic treatment combined with diagnostic testing at 4-monthly intervals plus immediate removal of positive animals showed to be effective to eradicate brucellosis independent of the diagnostic test strategy used in an acceptable time interval (1-2 years), depending on the initial number of infected animals.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an oncolytic virus that relies on the host cellular metabolism for replication. We tested the efficacy of VSV on peritoneal carcinomatosis and assessed VSV replication in cancer cells from ascites. BALB/c female mice bearing peritoneal H22 or MethA cells received an i.p. administration of 1x108 PFU VSV or 1x108 PFU equivalent of UV-inactivated VSV on day 10, 12 and 14 after incubation. Administration of VSV resulted in a significant inhibition of ascites formation and prolonged survival of the treated mice. The replication of VSV was obviously enhanced in the cancer cells from the ascites. Considering the central carbon metabolic pathways, cancer cells in the malignant ascites provided more exogenous glucose, glutamine and pyruvate after VSV infection due to its unregulated glycolytic activity and glutamine metabolism. Pharmacologically, inhibition of the glycolytic pathway and glutamine metabolism reduced VSV replication, and this inhibited replication was rescued by the addition of multiple tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. Our results demonstrated that metabolic adaptive processes in peritoneal carcinoma, such as high glycolytic activity and glutamine metabolism, favor VSV replication. These results suggest the clinical potency of VSV in the treatment of malignant ascites and provide new insights into the further exploration of the potential application of VSV in the treatment of hypoxia ascites cancer cells.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26707610&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mandal, Anirban</author><author>Ganta, Krishna Kumar</author><author>Chaubey, Binay</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combinations of siRNAs against La Autoantigen with NS5B or hVAP-A Have Additive Effect on Inhibition of HCV Replication.</title><secondary-title>Hepatitis research and treatment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hepatitis research and treatment</full-title><abbr-1>Hepatitis research and treatment</abbr-1></periodical><pages>9671031</pages><volume>2016</volume><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2090-1364</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2016/9671031</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Hepatitis C virus is major cause of chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Presently available direct-acting antiviral drugs have improved success rate; however, high cost limits their utilization, especially in developing countries like India. In the present study, we evaluated anti-HCV potential of several siRNAs targeted against the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B and cellular factors, La autoantigen, PSMA7, and human VAMP-associated protein to intercept different steps of viral life cycle. The target genes were downregulated individually as well as in combinations and their impact on viral replication was evaluated. Individual downregulation of La autoantigen, PSMA7, hVAP-A, and NS5B resulted in inhibition of HCV replication by about 67.2%, 50.7%, 39%, and 52%, respectively. However, antiviral effect was more pronounced when multiple genes were downregulated simultaneously. Combinations of siRNAs against La autoantigen with NS5B or hVAP-A resulted in greater inhibition in HCV replication. Our findings indicate that siRNA is a potential therapeutic tool for inhibiting HCV replication and simultaneously targeting multiple viral steps with the combination of siRNAs is more effective than silencing a single target.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27446609&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harris, Matthew</author><author>Weisberger, Emily</author><author>Silver, Diana</author><author>Macinko, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>'They hear "Africa" and they think that there can't be any good services'--perceived context in cross-national learning: a qualitative study of the barriers to Reverse Innovation.</title><secondary-title>Globalization and health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Globalization and health</full-title><abbr-1>Globalization and health</abbr-1></periodical><pages>45</pages><volume>11</volume><keywords><keyword>Africa</keyword><keyword>Bias</keyword><keyword>Delivery of Health Care/*methods</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Learning</keyword><keyword>Organizational Innovation*</keyword><keyword>Prejudice</keyword><keyword>Qualitative Research</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-11-19</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1744-8603</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12992-015-0130-z</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Country-of-origin of a product can negatively influence its rating, particularly if the product is from a low-income country. It follows that how non-traditional sources of innovation, such as low-income countries, are perceived is likely to be an important part of a diffusion process, particularly given the strong social and cognitive boundaries associated with the healthcare professions.; Methods: Between September and December 2014, we conducted eleven in-depth face-to-face or telephone interviews with key informants from innovation, health and social policy circles, experts in international comparative policy research and leaders in Reverse Innovation in the United States. Interviews were open-ended with guiding probes into the barriers and enablers to Reverse Innovation in the US context, specifically also to understand whether, in their experience translating or attempting to translate innovations from low-income contexts into the US, the source of the innovation matters in the adopter context. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically using the process of constant comparison.; Results: Our findings show that innovations from low-income countries tend to be discounted early on because of prior assumptions about the potential for these contexts to offer solutions to healthcare problems in the US. Judgments are made about the similarity of low-income contexts with the US, even though this is based oftentimes on flimsy perceptions only. Mixing levels of analysis, local and national, leads to country-level stereotyping and missed opportunities to learn from low-income countries.; Conclusions: Our research highlights that prior expectations, invoked by the Low-income country cue, are interfering with a transparent and objective learning process. There may be merit in adopting some techniques from the cognitive psychology and marketing literatures to understand better the relative importance of source in healthcare research and innovation diffusion. Counter-stereotyping techniques and decision-making tools may be useful to help decision-makers evaluate the generalizability of research findings objectively and transparently. We suggest that those interested in Reverse Innovation should reflect carefully on the value of disclosing the source of the innovation that is being proposed, if doing so is likely to invoke negative stereotypes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26582041&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grawunder, DÃ©sirÃ©e</author><author>Hambleton, Elizabeth A</author><author>Bucher, Madeline</author><author>Wolfowicz, Iliona</author><author>Bechtoldt, Natascha</author><author>Guse, Annika</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Induction of Gametogenesis in the Cnidarian Endosymbiosis Model Aiptasia sp.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title><abbr-1>Scientific reports</abbr-1></periodical><pages>15677</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Coral Reefs</keyword><keyword>Dinoflagellida/physiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gametogenesis/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Larva/growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Life Cycle Stages</keyword><keyword>Light</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Sea Anemones/*growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Sea Anemones/classification</keyword><keyword>Sea Anemones/physiology</keyword><keyword>Symbiosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-10-26</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2045-2322</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep15677</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Endosymbiosis is widespread among cnidarians and is of high ecological relevance. The tropical sea anemone Aiptasia sp. is a laboratory model system for endosymbiosis between reef-building corals and photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium. Here we identify the key environmental cues to induce reproducible spawning in Aiptasia under controlled laboratory conditions. We find that simulating a lunar cycle with blue-wavelength light is necessary to promote abundant gamete production and synchronous release in well-fed animals. Sexual reproduction rates are genetically determined and differ among clonal lines under similar conditions. We also find the inverse difference in rates of asexual reproduction.

Seventy-five articles related to binge eating disorder, grazing, night eating syndrome, emotional eating, food cravings and addiction, and pre-surgical expectations of post-surgical eating in this population were critically reviewed. A variety of often problematic eating behaviours appear more common in bariatric candidates than in non-obese populations. The literature suggests that 4-45% of candidates may have binge eating disorder, 20-60% may graze, 2-42% may have night eating syndrome, 38-59% may engage in emotional eating and 17-54% may fit criteria for food addiction. Binge eating may also be more prevalent in bariatric candidates than in similarly obese non-surgical individuals. Expectations of surgery are high, with pre-surgical candidates believing their bariatric procedure will virtually guarantee significantly improved eating behaviours. Study replications are needed, and further investigation into prevalence, impacts and candidate characteristics related to disordered eating behaviours, as well as candidates' expectations of eating after surgery, will be important. Further comparisons of bariatric candidates to similarly obese non-bariatric populations will be important to understand eating-related characteristics of candidates beyond those related to their weight. Future research may be improved by the use of validated measures, replicable methodologies, minimization of data collected in circumstances where respondents may been motivated to 'fake good', use of prospective data and consistent definitions of key terminology.

Replication was evaluated in 454 Latinos, 1564 European Americans, and 3187 African Americans from independent studies.; Results: We confirmed associations of 6 genes identified by means of previous genome-wide association studies and identified a novel genome-wide significant association of a polymorphism in the zinc finger protein 365 gene (ZNF365) with total IgE levels (rs200076616, PÂ = 2.3 Ã 10(-8)). We next identified 4 admixture mapping peaks (6p21.32-p22.1, 13p22-31, 14q23.2, and 22q13.1) at which local African, European, and/or Native American ancestry was significantly associated with IgE levels. The most significant peak was 6p21.32-p22.1, where Native American ancestry was associated with lower IgE levels (PÂ = 4.95 Ã 10(-8)). All but 22q13.1 were replicated in an independent sample of Latinos, and 2 of the peaks were replicated in African Americans (6p21.32-p22.1 and 14q23.2). Fine mapping of 6p21.32-p22.1 identified 6 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms in Latinos, 2 of which replicated in European Americans. Another single nucleotide polymorphism was peak-wide significant within 14q23.2 in African Americans (rs1741099, PÂ = 3.7 Ã 10(-6)) and replicated in non-African American samples (PÂ = .011).; Conclusion: We confirmed genetic associations at 6 genes and identified novel associations within ZNF365, HLA-DQA1, and 14q23.2. Our results highlight the importance of studying diverse multiethnic populations to uncover novel loci associatedÂ with total IgE levels.

Major disadvantages of commercially available LDH assay kits include proprietary formulations, limited options for optimization and high cost, all resulting in limited reproducibility in research applications. Here, we describe a novel, custom LDH assay suitable in the context of plate reader-based screening of drug candidates for glioprotection, but with wide applicability to other cell types and experimental paradigms.; Methods: We developed a novel and highly reproducible LDH release assay that is more cost-effective than commercially available assays with comparable performance. The assay was validated by assessing 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid antioxidant protection against tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced oxidative stress in C6 astroglioma cells. Assay performance was validated by direct comparison and compatible with other methods of measuring cellular viability, namely 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and 6-carboxy-2', 7' dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assays.; Results: There was no statistically significant difference between results obtained with the novel custom assay and a commercially available assay CytoTox96Â® (Promega, Madison, WI).; Discussion: The novel custom LDH release assay allows the reproducible quantification of cell viability and is highly cost-effective when compared to commercially available assays (approximately 25 times cheaper). In addition and in contrast to commercially available assays, the identification and detailed description of all assay components and procedures provide greater control over experimental conditions and design. We provide a detailed standard operating procedure permitting our novel assay to be readily adapted depending on experimental requirements. (Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, JCV replication was examined using different clones in 293âcells. RT-PCR assay revealed that large T antigen expression in cells transfected with IMR-32-adapted JCVs was significantly greater than in those transfected with Mad-1 or CY. DNA replication assay and viral load verified that the IMR-32-adapted JCVs were replication-competent in 293âcells, but not Mad-1 or CY JCVs.

A recent genome-wide analysis of Trypanosoma brucei, the etiological agent of sleeping sickness, localized its replication origins to the boundaries of multigenic transcription units. To better understand genomic replication in this organism, we examined replication by single molecule analysis of replicated DNA. We determined the average speed of replication forks of procyclic and bloodstream form cells and we found that T. brucei DNA replication rate is similar to rates seen in other eukaryotes. We also analyzed the replication dynamics of a central region of chromosome 1 in procyclic forms. We present evidence for replication terminating within the central part of the chromosome and thus emanating from both sides, suggesting a previously unmapped origin toward the 5' extremity of chromosome 1. Also, termination is not at a fixed location in chromosome 1, but is rather variable. Importantly, we found a replication origin located near an ORC1/CDC6 binding site that is detected after replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea treatment, suggesting it may be a dormant origin activated in response to replicative stress. Collectively, our findings support the existence of more replication origins in T. brucei than previously appreciated. (Â© The Author(s) 2015.

Incidence analysis of ischemic and hemorrhagic events with or without OAC resumption. Factors associated with favorable (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3) vs unfavorable functional outcome.; Results: Hemorrhage enlargement occurred in 307 of 853 patients (36.0%). Reduced rates of hematoma enlargement were associated with reversal of INR levels &lt;1.3 within 4 hours after admission (43/217 [19.8%]) vs INR of â¥1.3 (264/636 [41.5%]; Pâ&lt;â.001) and systolic BP &lt;160 mm Hg at 4 hours (167/504 [33.1%]) vs â¥160 mm Hg (98/187 [52.4%]; Pâ&lt;â.001).

Although the global rate of replication decreases, mammalian cells can respond to replication stress by activating new replication origins. We demonstrate that a moderate level of stress induced by inhibitors of topoisomerase I, commencing in early, mid or late S-phase, induces activation of new sites of replication located within or in the immediate vicinity of the original replication factories; only in early S some of these new sites are also activated at a distance greater than 300 nm. Under high stress levels very few new replication sites are activated; such sites are located within the original replication regions. There is a large variation in cellular response to stress - while in some cells the number of replication sites increases even threefold, it decreases almost twofold in other cells. Replication stress results in a loss of PCNA from replication factories and a twofold increase in nuclear volume. These observations suggest that activation of new replication origins from the pool of dormant origins within replication cluster under conditions of mild stress is generally restricted to the original replication clusters (factories) active at a time of stress initiation, while activation of distant origins and new replication factories is suppressed.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26212617&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cito, S</author><author>Geers, A J</author><author>Arroyo, M P</author><author>Palero, V R</author><author>PallarÃ©s, J</author><author>Vernet, A</author><author>Blasco, J</author><author>San RomÃ¡n, L</author><author>Fu, W</author><author>Qiao, A</author><author>Janiga, G</author><author>Miura, Y</author><author>Ohta, M</author><author>Mendina, M</author><author>Usera, G</author><author>Frangi, A F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Accuracy and reproducibility of patient-specific hemodynamic models of stented intracranial aneurysms: report on the Virtual Intracranial Stenting Challenge 2011.</title><secondary-title>Annals of biomedical engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of biomedical engineering</full-title><abbr-1>Annals of biomedical engineering</abbr-1></periodical><pages>154-167</pages><volume>43</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cerebrovascular Circulation</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Hemodynamics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hydrodynamics*</keyword><keyword>Intracranial Aneurysm/*physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Patient-Specific Modeling*</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Stents*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1573-9686</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10439-014-1082-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Validation studies are prerequisites for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to be accepted as part of clinical decision-making. This paper reports on the 2011 edition of the Virtual Intracranial Stenting Challenge. The challenge aimed to assess the reproducibility with which research groups can simulate the velocity field in an intracranial aneurysm, both untreated and treated with five different configurations of high-porosity stents. Particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) measurements were obtained to validate the untreated velocity field. Six participants, totaling three CFD solvers, were provided with surface meshes of the vascular geometry and the deployed stent geometries, and flow rate boundary conditions for all inlets and outlets. As output, they were invited to submit an abstract to the 8th International Interdisciplinary Cerebrovascular Symposium 2011 (ICS'11), outlining their methods and giving their interpretation of the performance of each stent configuration. After the challenge, all CFD solutions were collected and analyzed. To quantitatively analyze the data, we calculated the root-mean-square error (RMSE) over uniformly distributed nodes on a plane slicing the main flow jet along its axis and normalized it with the maximum velocity on the slice of the untreated case (NRMSE). Good agreement was found between CFD and PIV with a NRMSE of 7.28%. Excellent agreement was found between CFD solutions, both untreated and treated. The maximum difference between any two groups (along a line perpendicular to the main flow jet) was 4.0 mm/s, i.e. 4.1% of the maximum velocity of the untreated case, and the average NRMSE was 0.47% (range 0.28-1.03%). In conclusion, given geometry and flow rates, research groups can accurately simulate the velocity field inside an intracranial aneurysm-as assessed by comparison with in vitro measurements-and find excellent agreement on the hemodynamic effect of different stent configurations.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25118668&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Durrheim, David N</author><author>Crowcroft, Natasha S</author><author>Strebel, Peter M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measles - The epidemiology of elimination.</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title><abbr-1>Vaccine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>6880-6883</pages><volume>32</volume><number>51</number><issue>51</issue><keywords><keyword>Communicable Disease Control/*methods</keyword><keyword>Communicable Disease Control/organization &amp; administration</keyword><keyword>Disease Eradication*</keyword><keyword>Elimination</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Measles</keyword><keyword>Measles Vaccine/*administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Measles/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Measles/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Western Pacific, Americas, Epidemiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-12-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1873-2518</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.10.061</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Tremendous progress has been made globally to reduce the contribution of measles to the burden of childhood deaths and measles cases have dramatically decreased with increased two dose measles-containing vaccine coverage. As a result the Global Vaccine Action Plan, endorsed by the World Health Assembly, has targeted measles elimination in at least five of the six World Health Organisation Regions by 2020. This is an ambitious goal, since measles control requires the highest immunisation coverage of any vaccine preventable disease, which means that the health system must be able to reach every community. Further, while measles remains endemic in any country, importations will result in local transmission and outbreaks in countries and Regions that have interrupted local endemic measles circulation. One of the lines of evidence that countries and Regions must address to confirm measles elimination is a detailed description of measles epidemiology over an extended period. This information is incredibly valuable as predictable epidemiological patterns emerge as measles elimination is approached and achieved. These critical features, including the source, size and duration of outbreaks, the seasonality and age-distribution of cases, genotyping pointers and effective reproduction rate estimates, are discussed with illustrative examples from the Region of the Americas, which eliminated measles in 2002, and the Western Pacific Region, which has established a Regional Verification Commission to review progress towards elimination in all member countries.

However, the roles of miRNAs in EV71 replication and pathogenesis are not well understood. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-27a was significantly decreased in EV71-infected cells. Interestingly, the over-expression of miR-27a could inhibit EV71 replication, as measured by virus titration, qPCR, and Western blotting. We identified EGFR mRNA is a bona fide target of miR-27a by computational analysis and luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, miR-27a could decrease EGFR expression, as measured by qPCR and Western blotting. Moreover, the inhibition of EGFR expression by miR-27a decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, which facilitate EV71 replication. These results suggest that miR-27a may have antiviral activity against EV71 by inhibiting EGFR.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25212431&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Waal, Anne C</author><author>van Rossum, Michelle M</author><author>Kiemeney, Lambertus A L M</author><author>Aben, Katja K H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility of self-reported melanoma risk factors in melanoma patients.</title><secondary-title>Melanoma research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Melanoma research</full-title><abbr-1>Melanoma research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>592-601</pages><volume>24</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Environment</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Life Style</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Melanoma/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Melanoma/etiology</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Self Report*</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms/etiology</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1473-5636</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/CMR.0000000000000089</electronic-resource-num><abstract>As melanoma researchers continue to investigate environmental and lifestyle-related risk factors, questionnaire data remain important. The reproducibility of a questionnaire on melanoma risk factors was investigated using a test-retest approach in 389 Dutch melanoma patients. In 2011, 389 melanoma patients filled out a questionnaire on melanoma risk factors twice. Test-retest reproducibility was assessed by calculating kappas (Îº), weighted kappas (Îºw), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for categorical, ordinal, and continuous variables, respectively. Stratified analyses were carried out by sex, age group, education level, and time since diagnosis. The median time between the questionnaires was 31 days. The reproducibility was substantial for questions on phenotypic characteristics (Îº/Îºw/ICC=0.62-0.77), fair-to-substantial for sun exposure and sun protection behavior (Îº/Îºw/ICC=0.38-0.79), and moderate for sunburn history (Îº/Îºw=0.42-0.51). No clear differences were observed between men and women. Younger patients showed a better reproducibility in nine of the 29 questions compared with older patients and higher educated patients showed a better reproducibility in four of the 29 questions. Patients with a diagnosis shorter than 1.5 years ago had a better reproducibility in four out of 29 items compared with patients with a diagnosis 1.5-3.0 years ago. Our study showed that self-reported information on melanoma risk factors is fairly well reproducible. Although this does not guarantee validity, this type of questionnaire seems to be useful in research settings. The reproducibility is slightly better in young patients and patients with a higher education level, which can be taken into account when interpreting results from epidemiological studies.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24892955&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tulloch, Fiona</author><author>Pathania, Uday</author><author>Luke, Garry A</author><author>Nicholson, John</author><author>Stonehouse, Nicola J</author><author>Rowlands, David J</author><author>Jackson, Terry</author><author>Tuthill, Toby</author><author>Haas, Juergen</author><author>Lamond, Angus I</author><author>Ryan, Martin D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FMDV replicons encoding green fluorescent protein are replication competent.</title><secondary-title>Journal of virological methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of virological methods</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of virological methods</abbr-1></periodical><pages>35-40</pages><volume>209</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/analysis</keyword><keyword>Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>FMDV</keyword><keyword>Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus/genetics</keyword><keyword>Green Fluorescent Proteins/*analysis</keyword><keyword>Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Molecular Biology/*methods</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins/analysis</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Replication</keyword><keyword>Replicon</keyword><keyword>Staining and Labeling/methods</keyword><keyword>Virology/*methods</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1879-0984</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.08.020</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The study of replication of viruses that require high bio-secure facilities can be accomplished with less stringent containment using non-infectious 'replicon' systems. The FMDV replicon system (pT7rep) reported by Mclnerney et al. (2000) was modified by the replacement of sequences encoding chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) with those encoding a functional L proteinase (L(pro)) linked to a bi-functional fluorescent/antibiotic resistance fusion protein (green fluorescent protein/puromycin resistance, [GFP-PAC]). Cells were transfected with replicon-derived transcript RNA and GFP fluorescence quantified. Replication of transcript RNAs was readily detected by fluorescence, whilst the signal from replication-incompetent forms of the genome was &gt;2-fold lower. Surprisingly, a form of the replicon lacking the L(pro) showed a significantly stronger fluorescence signal, but appeared with slightly delayed kinetics. Replication can, therefore, be quantified simply by live-cell imaging and image analyses, providing a rapid and facile alternative to RT-qPCR or CAT assays. (Copyright Â© 2014 The Authors.

Investigation of HuNoV replication and development of antiviral therapeutics in cell culture remain challenging tasks. Here, we present NoroGLuc, a HuNoV protease reporter system based on a fusion of NV p41 protein with a naturally secreted Gaussia luciferase (GLuc), linked by the p41/p22 cleavage site for NV protease (Pro). trans cleavage of NoroGLuc by NV Pro or Pro precursors results in release and secretion of an active GLuc. Using this system, we observed a cell type-specific activity profile of NV Pro and Pro precursors, suggesting that the activity of NV Pro is modulated by other viral proteins in the precursor forms and strongly influenced by cellular factors. NoroGLuc was also cleaved by Pro and Pro precursors generated from replication of NV stool RNA in transfected cells, resulting in a measurable increase of secreted GLuc. Truncation analysis revealed that the N-terminal membrane association domain of NV p41 is critical for NoroGLuc activity. Although designed for NV, a genogroup GI.1 norovirus, NoroGLuc also efficiently detects Pro activities from GII.3 and GII.4 noroviruses. At noncytotoxic concentrations, protease inhibitors ZnCl2 and NÎ±-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory effects on a GII.4 Pro by NoroGLuc assay. These results establish NoroGLuc as a pan-genogroup HuNoV protease reporter system that can be used for the study of HuNoV proteases and precursors, monitoring of viral RNA replication, and evaluation of antiviral agents.; Importance: Human noroviruses are the leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Currently, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available to counter these highly contagious viruses. These viruses are currently noncultivatable in cell culture. Here, we report the development of a novel cell-based reporter system called NoroGLuc that can be used for studying norovirus replication and also for screening/evaluation of antiviral agents. This system is based on the fusion between viral protein p41 and a naturally secreted Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) with a cleavage site that can be recognized by the viral protease. Cleavage of this fusion protein by the viral protease results in the release and secretion of an active GLuc. Using NoroGLuc, we demonstrated a cell type-specific activity profile of the viral protease and its precursors and dose-dependent inhibitory effects of two protease inhibitors. This novel reporter system should be useful in probing norovirus replication and evaluating antiviral agents. (Copyright Â© 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

The add&amp;#95;my&amp;#95;pet collection of over 300 animal species from most larger phyla, and all chordate classes, shows that this model fits energy data very well. Nine parameters determine nine data points at abundant food: dry/wet weight ratio, age at birth, puberty, death, weight at birth, metamorphosis, puberty, ultimate weight and ultimate reproduction rate. We demonstrate that, given a few other parameters, these nine data points also determine the nine parameters uniquely that are independent of food availability: maturity at birth, metamorphosis and puberty, specific assimilation, somatic maintenance and costs for structure, allocation fraction of mobilised reserve to soma, energy conductance, and ageing acceleration. We provide an efficient algorithm for mapping between data and parameter space in both directions and found expressions for the boundaries of the parameter and data spaces. One of them quantifies the position of species in the supply-demand spectrum, which reflects the internalisation of energetic control. We link eco-physiological properties of species to their position in this spectrum and discuss it in the context of homeostasis. Invertebrates and ray-finned fish turn out to be close to the supply end of the spectrum, while other vertebrates, including cartilaginous fish, have stronger demand tendencies. We explain why birds and mammals up-regulate metabolism during reproduction. We study some properties of the bijection using elasticity coefficients. The properties have applications in parameter estimation and in the analysis of evolutionary constraints on parameter values; the relationship between DEB parameters and data has similarities to that between genotype and phenotype.

Increased cardiovascular risk in SLE is not explained by traditional risk factors. We examined the hypothesis that genetic variation contributes to the presence of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with SLE. The genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 152 candidate genes linked with autoimmune or cardiovascular risk were determined in 125 patients with SLE. Coronary artery calcium (CAC), a measure of coronary atherosclerosis, was detected in 32 patients (26%) by electron-beam computed tomography. Polymorphism in 20 of the candidate genes (ADAM33, ADIPOQ, CCL5, CCR7, CDKN2B, CSF1, IL4, IL12A, IL23R, INS, IRF5, MIF, MS4A1, PTGS1, PTPN22, RETN, SELE, TNFSF4, TNFRSF11B, and VCAM1) were nominally associated with the presence of CAC (p-valuesâ=â0.001-0.047 after adjustment for age, sex and race). Some of these are known susceptibility genes for SLE and others have been implicated in cardiovascular disease in other populations. No association withstood false discovery rate adjustment. Replication studies in additional cohorts of patients with SLE may be informative.

The standard way of assessing hand function in MS is the 9-hole peg test (9HPT), one of the three components of the MS functional composite measure. In this study we examine the squares test (ST), a test of hand function that is used extensively in handedness research. We evaluated reproducibility of the ST in 49 healthy controls, and both discriminatory power and concurrent validity of the ST in 38 MS patients and 18 age and gender matched controls. The ST proved to be a reliable and easy to administrate paper-and-pencil test of hand function. The ST showed a high and highly significant correlation with the standard 9HPT over a broad range of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, and had high discriminatory power, also comparable to the 9HPT. Therefore, the ST is a candidate test for use in composite measures of MS related functional deficits for clinical practice and in clinical trials. (Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For herpes simplex virus type-1 gene silencing, three different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the herpes simplex virus type-1 UL39 gene (sequence si-UL 39-1, si-UL 39-2, and si-UL 39-3) were used, which encode the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, an essential enzyme for DNA synthesis. Herpes simplex virus type-1 was isolated from saliva samples and mucocutaneous lesions from infected patients. All mucocutaneous lesions' samples were positive for herpes simplex virus type-1 by real-time PCR and by virus isolation; all herpes simplex virus type-1 from saliva samples were positive by real-time PCR and 50% were positive by virus isolation. The levels of herpes simplex virus type-1 DNA remaining after siRNA treatment were assessed by real-time PCR, whose results demonstrated that the effect of siRNAs on gene expression depends on siRNA concentration. The three siRNA sequences used were able to inhibit viral replication, assessed by real-time PCR and plaque assays and among them, the sequence si-UL 39-1 was the most effective. This sequence inhibited 99% of herpes simplex virus type-1 replication. The results demonstrate that silencing herpes simplex virus type-1 UL39 expression by siRNAs effectively inhibits herpes simplex virus type-1 replication, suggesting that siRNA based antiviral strategy may be a potential therapeutic alternative.

Second, among serum metabolites correlated with diet, we evaluated metabolite reproducibility and required sample sizes to determine the potential for metabolomics in epidemiologic studies.; Design: Baseline serum from 502 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was analyzed by using ultra-high-performance liquid-phase chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Usual intakes of 36 dietary groups were estimated by using a food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary biomarkers were identified by using partial Pearson's correlations with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between samples collected 1 y apart in a subset of 30 individuals were calculated to evaluate intraindividual metabolite variability.; Results: We detected 412 known metabolites. Citrus, green vegetables, red meat, shellfish, fish, peanuts, rice, butter, coffee, beer, liquor, total alcohol, and multivitamins were each correlated with at least one metabolite (P &lt; 1.093 Ã 10(-6); r = -0.312 to 0.398); in total, 39 dietary biomarkers were identified. Some correlations (citrus intake with stachydrine) replicated previous studies; others, such as peanuts and tryptophan betaine, were novel findings. Other strong associations included coffee (with trigonelline-N-methylnicotinate and quinate) and alcohol (with ethyl glucuronide). Intraindividual variability in metabolite levels (1-y ICCs) ranged from 0.27 to 0.89. Large, but attainable, sample sizes are required to detect associations between metabolites and disease in epidemiologic studies, further emphasizing the usefulness of metabolomics in nutritional epidemiology.; Conclusions: We identified dietary biomarkers by using metabolomics in an epidemiologic data set. Given the strength of the associations observed, we expect that some of these metabolites will be validated in future studies and later used as biomarkers in large cohorts to study diet-disease associations. The PLCO trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00002540.

To continue to clinically translatable studies, TERM alternatives need to be evaluated in (large) controlled and standardized animal studies. Here, we investigated all evidence for the efficacy of tissue engineered constructs in animal models for urinary diversion. Studies investigating this subject were identified through a systematic search of three different databases (PubMed, Embase and Web of Science). From each study, animal characteristics, study characteristics and experimental outcomes for meta-analyses were tabulated. Furthermore, the reporting of items vital for study replication was assessed. The retrieved studies (8 in total) showed extreme heterogeneity in study design, including animal models, biomaterials and type of urinary diversion. All studies were feasibility studies, indicating the novelty of this field. None of the studies included appropriate control groups, i.e. a comparison with the classical treatment using GI tissue. The meta-analysis showed a trend towards successful experimentation in larger animals although no specific animal species could be identified as the most suitable model. Larger animals appear to allow a better translation to the human situation, with respect to anatomy and surgical approaches. It was unclear whether the use of cells benefits the formation of a neo urinary conduit. The reporting of the methodology and data according to standardized guidelines was insufficient and should be improved to increase the value of such publications. In conclusion, animal models in the field of TERM for urinary diversion have probably been chosen for reasons other than their predictive value. Controlled and comparative long term animal studies, with adequate methodological reporting are needed to proceed to clinical translatable studies. This will aid in good quality research with the reduction in the use of animals and an increase in empirical evidence of biomedical research.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24964011&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mariotti, Jacopo</author><author>Maura, Francesco</author><author>Spina, Francesco</author><author>Roncari, Luisa</author><author>Dodero, Anna</author><author>Farina, Lucia</author><author>Montefusco, Vittorio</author><author>Carniti, Cristiana</author><author>Sarina, Barbara</author><author>Patriarca, Francesca</author><author>Rambaldi, Alessandro</author><author>Onida, Francesco</author><author>Olivieri, Attilio</author><author>Zallio, Francesco</author><author>Corradini, Paolo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of cytomegalovirus replication and cytomegalovirus serostatus on the outcome of patients with B cell lymphoma after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.</title><secondary-title>Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation</full-title><abbr-1>Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation</abbr-1></periodical><pages>885-890</pages><volume>20</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Cytomegalovirus (CMV)</keyword><keyword>Cytomegalovirus Infections/*virology</keyword><keyword>Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood</keyword><keyword>Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology</keyword><keyword>Cytomegalovirus/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, B-Cell/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, B-Cell/*virology</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Transplantation Conditioning/*methods</keyword><keyword>Transplantation, Homologous</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1523-6536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbmt.2014.02.015</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was historically associated with increased nonrelapse mortality (NRM). More recently, different groups have reported an association between CMV replication and reduced risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse. Given the conflicting results, we evaluated the impact of CMV replication and other covariates on the outcome of a retrospective cohort of 265 adults with B cell lymphoma receiving allogeneic HSCT from HLA-identical siblings or alternative donors. In time-dependent multivariate analysis, CMV replication, evaluated by pp65 antigenemia, had no independent effect on the risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], .6 to 1.6; P = .9), although it was associated with a reduced overall survival (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.2; P = .001) and an increased NRM (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3; P = .01). Consistently, donor and/or recipient CMV seropositivity were not associated with a different outcome relative to CMV double-negative serostatus. In multivariate models, a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (P &lt; .0001) and pretransplantation complete remission status (P &lt; .0001) were the main independent predictors for improved relapse-free survival. In summary, contrary to what is observed in patients with AML, this report identifies no independent role for CMV replication or serostatus on the relapse of patients with B cell lymphomas undergoing allogeneic HSCT.

Data including and excluding Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) markers were summed to a MS Genetic Burden (MSGB) score. Study replication was performed in a cohort of white American MS patients (n = 1997) and controls (n = 708).; Results: The total human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and the non-HLA MSGB scores were significantly higher in MS patients than in controls, in both cohorts (P &lt;&lt; 10(-22)). MS patients, with and without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands (OCBs), had a higher MSGB score than the controls; the OCB-positive patients had a slightly higher MSGB than the OCB-negative patients. An early age at symptom onset (AAO) also correlated with a higher MSGB score, in both cohorts.; Conclusion: The MSGB score was associated with specific clinical MS characteristics, such as OCBs and AAO. This study underlines the need for well-characterized, large cohorts of MS patients, and the usefulness of summarizing multiple genetic risk factors of modest effect size in genotype-phenotype analyses.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24099750&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Hyungjin</author><author>Park, Chang Min</author><author>Song, Yong Sub</author><author>Lee, Sang Min</author><author>Goo, Jin Mo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of radiation dose and iterative reconstruction algorithms for measurement accuracy and reproducibility of pulmonary nodule volumetry: A phantom study.</title><secondary-title>European journal of radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European journal of radiology</full-title><abbr-1>European journal of radiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>848-857</pages><volume>83</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms*</keyword><keyword>Computer-assisted image processing</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods</keyword><keyword>Lung neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Multidetector computed tomography</keyword><keyword>Phantoms, Imaging</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary nodule</keyword><keyword>Radiation dosage</keyword><keyword>Radiation Dosage*</keyword><keyword>Radiation Protection/*methods</keyword><keyword>Radiographic Image Enhancement/methods</keyword><keyword>Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of results</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Solitary Pulmonary Nodule/*diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed/instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Tumor Burden</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1872-7727</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ejrad.2014.01.025</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: To evaluate the influence of radiation dose settings and reconstruction algorithms on the measurement accuracy and reproducibility of semi-automated pulmonary nodule volumetry.; Materials and Methods: CT scans were performed on a chest phantom containing various nodules (10 and 12mm; +100, -630 and -800HU) at 120kVp with tube current-time settings of 10, 20, 50, and 100mAs. Each CT was reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP), iDose(4) and iterative model reconstruction (IMR). Semi-automated volumetry was performed by two radiologists using commercial volumetry software for nodules at each CT dataset. Noise, contrast-to-noise ratio and signal-to-noise ratio of CT images were also obtained. The absolute percentage measurement errors and differences were then calculated for volume and mass. The influence of radiation dose and reconstruction algorithm on measurement accuracy, reproducibility and objective image quality metrics was analyzed using generalized estimating equations.; Results: Measurement accuracy and reproducibility of nodule volume and mass were not significantly associated with CT radiation dose settings or reconstruction algorithms (p&gt;0.05). Objective image quality metrics of CT images were superior in IMR than in FBP or iDose(4) at all radiation dose settings (p&lt;0.05).; Conclusion: Semi-automated nodule volumetry can be applied to low- or ultralow-dose chest CT with usage of a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm without losing measurement accuracy and reproducibility.

We modeled a behavioral task where the correct responses to a set of specific sensory stimuli varied systematically across different contexts. The correct response depended on the stimulus (A,B,C,D) and context quadrant (1,2,3,4). The possible 16 stimulus-context combinations were associated with one of two responses (X,Y), one of which was correct for half of the combinations. The correct responses varied symmetrically across contexts. This allowed responses to previously unseen stimuli (probe stimuli) to be generalized from stimuli that had been presented previously. By testing the simulation on two or more stimuli that the network had never seen in a particular context, we could test whether the correct response on the novel stimuli could be generated based on knowledge of the correct responses in other contexts. We tested this generalization capability with a Deep Belief Network (DBN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network, and the combination of a DBN with a linear perceptron (LP). Overall, the combination of the DBN and LP had the highest success rate for generalization.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24671178&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>KÃ¼hnert, Denise</author><author>Stadler, Tanja</author><author>Vaughan, Timothy G</author><author>Drummond, Alexei J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simultaneous reconstruction of evolutionary history and epidemiological dynamics from viral sequences with the birth-death SIR model.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</abbr-1></periodical><pages>20131106</pages><volume>11</volume><number>94</number><issue>94</issue><keywords><keyword>Argentina/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Bayesian phylogenetics</keyword><keyword>birthâdeath prior</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Hepacivirus/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis C*/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis C*/genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections*/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections*/genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>mathematical epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological*</keyword><keyword>phylodynamics</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny*</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom/epidemiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-02-26</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1742-5662</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rsif.2013.1106</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The evolution of RNA viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus and influenza virus, occurs so rapidly that the viruses' genomes contain information on past ecological dynamics. Hence, we develop a phylodynamic method that enables the joint estimation of epidemiological parameters and phylogenetic history. Based on a compartmental susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, this method provides separate information on incidence and prevalence of infections. Detailed information on the interaction of host population dynamics and evolutionary history can inform decisions on how to contain or entirely avoid disease outbreaks. We apply our birth-death SIR method to two viral datasets. First, five HIV type 1 clusters sampled in the UK between 1999 and 2003 are analysed. The estimated basic reproduction ratios range from 1.9 to 3.2 among the clusters. All clusters show a decline in the growth rate of the local epidemic in the middle or end of the 1990s. The analysis of a hepatitis C virus genotype 2c dataset shows that the local epidemic in the CÃ³rdoban city Cruz del Eje originated around 1906 (median), coinciding with an immigration wave from Europe to central Argentina that dates from 1880 to 1920.

Viability and mutagenicity of the S-cdA construct were dependent on functional pol V, but mutational frequencies (MFs) and types varied in pol II- and pol IV-deficient strains relative to the wild-type strain. Both S-cdA â T and S-cdA â G substitutions occurred in equal frequency in wild-type E. coli, but the frequency of S-cdA â G dropped in pol IV-deficient strain, especially when being SOS induced. This suggests that pol IV plays a role in S-cdA â G mutations. MF increased significantly in pol II-deficient strain, suggesting pol II's likely role in error-free translesion synthesis. Primer extension and steady-state kinetic studies using pol IV, exo-free Klenow fragment (KF (exo(-))), and Dpo4 were performed to further assess the replication efficiency and fidelity of S-cdA and S-cdG. Primer extension by pol IV mostly stopped before the lesion, although a small fraction was extended opposite the lesion. Kinetic studies showed that pol IV incorporated dCMP almost as efficiently as dTMP opposite S-cdA, whereas it incorporated the correct nucleotide dCMP opposite S-cdG 10-fold more efficiently than any other dNMP. Further extension of each lesion containing pair, however, was very inefficient. These results are consistent with the role of pol IV in S-cdA â G mutations in E. coli. KF (exo(-)) was also strongly blocked by both lesions, but it could slowly incorporate the correct nucleotide opposite them. In contrast, Dpo4 could extend a small fraction of the primer to a full-length product on both S-cdG and S-cdA templates. Dpo4 incorporated dTMP preferentially opposite S-cdA over the other dNMPs, but the discrimination was only 2- to 8-fold more proficient. Further extension of the S-cdA:T and S-cdA:C pair was not much different. For S-cdG, conversely, the wrong nucleotide, dTMP, was incorporated more efficiently than dCMP, although one-base extension of the S-cdG:T pair was less efficient than the S-cdG:C pair. S-cdG, therefore, has the propensity to cause G â A transition, as was reported to occur in E. coli. The results of this study are consistent with the strong replication blocking nature of S-cdA and S-cdG, and their ability to initiate error-prone synthesis by Y-family DNA polymerases.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24392701&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mori, Seiichiro</author><author>Kusumoto-Matsuo, Rika</author><author>Ishii, Yoshiyuki</author><author>Takeuchi, Takamasa</author><author>Kukimoto, Iwao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication interference between human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 mediated by heterologous E1 helicases.</title><secondary-title>Virology journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virology journal</full-title><abbr-1>Virology journal</abbr-1></periodical><pages>11</pages><volume>11</volume><keywords><keyword>Cell Line, Tumor</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells/virology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Human papillomavirus 16/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Human papillomavirus 16/enzymology</keyword><keyword>Human papillomavirus 16/genetics</keyword><keyword>Human papillomavirus 18/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Human papillomavirus 18/enzymology</keyword><keyword>Human papillomavirus 18/genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunoprecipitation</keyword><keyword>Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics</keyword><keyword>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Viral Interference*</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-01-24</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1743-422X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1743-422X-11-11</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Co-infection of multiple genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) is commonly observed among women with abnormal cervical cytology, but how different HPVs interact with each other in the same cell is not clearly understood. A previous study using cultured keratinocytes revealed that genome replication of one HPV type is inhibited by co-existence of the genome of another HPV type, suggesting that replication interference occurs between different HPV types when co-infected; however, molecular mechanisms underlying inter-type replication interference have not been fully explored.; Methods: Replication interference between two most prevalent HPV types, HPV16 and HPV18, was examined in HPV-negative C33A cervical carcinoma cells co-transfected with genomes of HPV16 and HPV18 together with expression plasmids for E1/E2 of both types. Levels of HPV16/18 genome replication were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Physical interaction between HPV16/18 E1s was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation assays in the cell lysates.; Results: The replication of HPV16 and HPV18 genomes was suppressed by co-expression of E1/E2 of heterologous types. The interference was mediated by the heterologous E1, but not E2. The oligomerization domain of HPV16 E1 was essential for HPV18 replication inhibition, whereas the helicase domain was dispensable. HPV16 E1 co-precipitated with HPV18 E1 in the cell lysates, and an HPV16 E1 mutant Y379A, which bound to HPV18 E1 less efficiently, failed to inhibit HPV18 replication.; Conclusions: Co-infection of a single cell with both HPV16 and HPV18 results in replication interference between them, and physical interaction between the heterologous E1s is responsible for the interference. Heterooligomers composed of HPV16/18 E1s may lack the ability to support HPV genome replication.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24456830&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thorp, Elias B</author><author>Larson, Eric</author><author>Stepp, Cara E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combined Auditory and Vibrotactile Feedback for Human-Machine-Interface Control.</title><secondary-title>IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</abbr-1></periodical><pages>62-68</pages><volume>22</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Auditory Perception/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Biofeedback, Psychology/methods</keyword><keyword>Biofeedback, Psychology/physiology</keyword><keyword>Electromyography/*methods</keyword><keyword>Facial Muscles/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Feedback, Sensory/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Man-Machine Systems*</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>Task Performance and Analysis</keyword><keyword>Touch/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Vibration</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1558-0210</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2273177</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the addition of binary vibrotactile stimulation to continuous auditory feedback (vowel synthesis) for human-machine interface (HMI) control. Sixteen healthy participants controlled facial surface electromyography to achieve 2-D targets (vowels). Eight participants used only real-time auditory feedback to locate targets whereas the other eight participants were additionally alerted to having achieved targets with confirmatory vibrotactile stimulation at the index finger. All participants trained using their assigned feedback modality (auditory alone or combined auditory and vibrotactile) over three sessions on three days and completed a fourth session on the third day using novel targets to assess generalization. Analyses of variance performed on the 1) percentage of targets reached and 2) percentage of trial time at the target revealed a main effect for feedback modality: participants using combined auditory and vibrotactile feedback performed significantly better than those using auditory feedback alone. No effect was found for session or the interaction of feedback modality and session, indicating a successful generalization to novel targets but lack of improvement over training sessions. Future research is necessary to determine the cognitive cost associated with combined auditory and vibrotactile feedback during HMI control.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23912500&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moore, Lindsay S</author><author>Stolovicki, Elad</author><author>Braun, Erez</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Population dynamics of metastable growth-rate phenotypes.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title><abbr-1>PloS one</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e81671</pages><volume>8</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptation, Physiological</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Evolution, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Hydro-Lyases/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological*</keyword><keyword>Phenotype*</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*cytology</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-12-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0081671</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Neo-Darwinian evolution has presented a paradigm for population dynamics built on random mutations and selection with a clear separation of time-scales between single-cell mutation rates and the rate of reproduction. Laboratory experiments on evolving populations until now have concentrated on the fixation of beneficial mutations. Following the Darwinian paradigm, these experiments probed populations at low temporal resolution dictated by the rate of rare mutations, ignoring the intermediate evolving phenotypes. Selection however, works on phenotypes rather than genotypes. Research in recent years has uncovered the complexity of genotype-to-phenotype transformation and a wealth of intracellular processes including epigenetic inheritance, which operate on a wide range of time-scales. Here, by studying the adaptation dynamics of genetically rewired yeast cells, we show a novel type of population dynamics in which the intracellular processes intervene in shaping the population structure. Under constant environmental conditions, we measure a wide distribution of growth rates that coexist in the population for very long durations (&gt;100 generations). Remarkably, the fastest growing cells do not take over the population on the time-scale dictated by the width of the growth-rate distributions and simple selection. Additionally, we measure significant fluctuations in the population distribution of various phenotypes: the fraction of exponentially-growing cells, the distributions of single-cell growth-rates and protein content. The observed fluctuations relax on time-scales of many generations and thus do not reflect noisy processes. Rather, our data show that the phenotypic state of the cells, including the growth-rate, for large populations in a constant environment is metastable and varies on time-scales that reflect the importance of long-term intracellular processes in shaping the population structure. This lack of time-scale separation between the intracellular and population processes calls for a new framework for population dynamics which is likely to be significant in a wide range of biological contexts, from evolution to cancer.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24312571&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Y A</author><author>Choi, H J</author><author>Lee, J Y</author><author>Han, B G</author><author>Shin, C S</author><author>Cho, N H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication of Caucasian loci associated with bone mineral density in Koreans.</title><secondary-title>Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA</full-title><abbr-1>Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2603-2610</pages><volume>24</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Asian People/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Bone Density/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Femur Neck/physiology</keyword><keyword>Genetic Loci*</keyword><keyword>Genetic Markers</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Genotyping Techniques/methods</keyword><keyword>Hip Joint/physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lumbar Vertebrae/physiology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Osteoporosis/ethnology</keyword><keyword>Osteoporosis/genetics</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Sex Characteristics</keyword><keyword>White People/genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1433-2965</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00198-013-2354-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Summary: Most bone mineral density (BMD) loci were reported in Caucasian genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This study investigated the association between 59 known BMD loci (+200 suggestive SNPs) and DXA-derived BMD in East Asian population with respect to sex and site specificity. We also identified four novel BMD candidate loci from the suggestive SNPs.; Introduction: Most GWAS have reported BMD-related variations in Caucasian populations. This study investigates whether the BMD loci discovered in Caucasian GWAS are also associated with BMD in East Asian ethnic samples.; Methods: A total of 2,729 unrelated Korean individuals from a population-based cohort were analyzed. We selected 747 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These markers included 547 SNPs from 59 loci with genome-wide significance (GWS, p value less than 5âÃâ10(-8)) levels and 200 suggestive SNPs that showed weaker BMD association with p value less than 5âÃâ10(-5). After quality control, 535 GWS SNPs and 182 suggestive SNPs were included in the replication analysis.; Results: Of the 535 GWS SNPs, 276 from 25 loci were replicated (pâ&lt;â0.05) in the Korean population with 51.6 % replication rate. Of the 182 suggestive variants, 16 were replicated (pâ&lt;â0.05, 8.8 % of replication rate), and five reached a significant combined p value (less than 7.0âÃâ10(-5), 0.05/717 SNPs, corrected for multiple testing). Two markers (rs11711157, rs3732477) are for the same signal near the gene CPN2 (carboxypeptidase N, polypeptide 2). The other variants, rs6436440 and rs2291296, were located in the genes AP1S3 (adaptor-related protein complex 1, sigma 3 subunit) and RARB (retinoic acid receptor, beta).; Conclusion: Our results illustrate ethnic differences in BMD susceptibility genes and underscore the need for further genetic studies in each ethnic group. We were also able to replicate some SNPs with suggestive associations. These SNPs may be BMD-related genetic markers and should be further investigated.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23575750&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rose, Nicolas</author><author>HervÃ©, SÃ©verine</author><author>Eveno, Eric</author><author>Barbier, Nicolas</author><author>Eono, Florent</author><author>Dorenlor, Virginie</author><author>Andraud, Mathieu</author><author>Camsusou, Claire</author><author>Madec, FranÃ§ois</author><author>Simon, GaÃ«lle</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamics of influenza A virus infections in permanently infected pig farms: evidence of recurrent infections, circulation of several swine influenza viruses and reassortment events.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary research</full-title><abbr-1>Veterinary research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>72</pages><volume>44</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disease Outbreaks/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>France/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/*isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Influenza A Virus, H1N2 Subtype/*isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Orthomyxoviridae Infections/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Orthomyxoviridae Infections/virology</keyword><keyword>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Reassortant Viruses/*isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/virology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-09-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1297-9716</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1297-9716-44-72</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Concomitant infections by different influenza A virus subtypes within pig farms increase the risk of new reassortant virus emergence. The aims of this study were to characterize the epidemiology of recurrent swine influenza virus infections and identify their main determinants. A follow-up study was carried out in 3 selected farms known to be affected by repeated influenza infections. Three batches of pigs were followed within each farm from birth to slaughter through a representative sample of 40 piglets per batch. Piglets were monitored individually on a monthly basis for serology and clinical parameters. When a flu outbreak occurred, daily virological and clinical investigations were carried out for two weeks. Influenza outbreaks, confirmed by influenza A virus detection, were reported at least once in each batch. These outbreaks occurred at a constant age within farms and were correlated with an increased frequency of sneezing and coughing fits. H1N1 and H1N2 viruses from European enzootic subtypes and reassortants between viruses from these lineages were consecutively and sometimes simultaneously identified depending on the batch, suggesting virus co-circulations at the farm, batch and sometimes individual levels. The estimated reproduction ratio R of influenza outbreaks ranged between 2.5 [1.9-2.9] and 6.9 [4.1-10.5] according to the age at infection-time and serological status of infected piglets. Duration of shedding was influenced by the age at infection time, the serological status of the dam and mingling practices. An impaired humoral response was identified in piglets infected at a time when they still presented maternally-derived antibodies.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24007505&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laverty, Daniel J</author><author>Kury, Alexandria L</author><author>Kuksin, Dmitry</author><author>Pirani, Alnoor</author><author>Flanagan, Kevin</author><author>Chan, Leo Li-Ying</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automated quantification of budding Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a novel image cytometry method.</title><secondary-title>Journal of industrial microbiology &amp; biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of industrial microbiology &amp; biotechnology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of industrial microbiology &amp; biotechnology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>581-588</pages><volume>40</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Automation</keyword><keyword>Beer/microbiology</keyword><keyword>Biofuels</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle</keyword><keyword>Fermentation</keyword><keyword>Image Cytometry/*methods</keyword><keyword>Microbial Viability</keyword><keyword>Observation</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*cytology</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae/growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Zea mays/microbiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1476-5535</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10295-013-1263-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The measurements of concentration, viability, and budding percentages of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are performed on a routine basis in the brewing and biofuel industries. Generation of these parameters is of great importance in a manufacturing setting, where they can aid in the estimation of product quality, quantity, and fermentation time of the manufacturing process. Specifically, budding percentages can be used to estimate the reproduction rate of yeast populations, which directly correlates with metabolism of polysaccharides and bioethanol production, and can be monitored to maximize production of bioethanol during fermentation. The traditional method involves manual counting using a hemacytometer, but this is time-consuming and prone to human error. In this study, we developed a novel automated method for the quantification of yeast budding percentages using Cellometer image cytometry. The automated method utilizes a dual-fluorescent nucleic acid dye to specifically stain live cells for imaging analysis of unique morphological characteristics of budding yeast. In addition, cell cycle analysis is performed as an alternative method for budding analysis. We were able to show comparable yeast budding percentages between manual and automated counting, as well as cell cycle analysis. The automated image cytometry method is used to analyze and characterize corn mash samples directly from fermenters during standard fermentation. Since concentration, viability, and budding percentages can be obtained simultaneously, the automated method can be integrated into the fermentation quality assurance protocol, which may improve the quality and efficiency of beer and bioethanol production processes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23558850&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shan, Chao</author><author>Li, Xiaodan</author><author>Deng, Chenglin</author><author>Shang, Baodi</author><author>Xu, Linlin</author><author>Ye, Hanqing</author><author>Yuan, Zhiming</author><author>Zhang, Bo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development and characterization of West Nile virus replicon expressing secreted Gaussia luciferase.</title><secondary-title>Virologica Sinica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virologica Sinica</full-title><abbr-1>Virologica Sinica</abbr-1></periodical><pages>161-166</pages><volume>28</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cricetinae</keyword><keyword>Culture Media/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods</keyword><keyword>Genes, Reporter*</keyword><keyword>Luciferases/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Luciferases/genetics</keyword><keyword>Staining and Labeling/*methods</keyword><keyword>West Nile virus/*enzymology</keyword><keyword>West Nile virus/genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1995-820X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12250-013-3332-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We developed a Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporter replicon of West Nile virus (WNV) and used it to quantify viral translation and RNA replication.

In contrast to this genetic stability, we observed unusually frequent mutation of the Î²-D-glycosidase gene (lacS) of a shuttle plasmid (pJlacS) propagated in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. The resulting Lac(-) mutants also grew faster than the Lac(+) parent, thereby amplifying the impact of the frequent lacS mutations on the population. We developed a mutant accumulation assay and corrections for the effects of copy number and differential growth for this system; the resulting measurements and calculations yielded a corrected rate of 5.1 Ã 10(-4) mutational events at the lacS gene per plasmid replication. Analysis of independent lacS mutants revealed three types of mutations: (i) G Â· C-to-A Â· T transitions, (ii) slipped-strand events, and (iii) deletions. These mutations were frequent in plasmid-borne lacS expressed at a high level but not in single-copy lacS in the chromosome or at lower levels of expression in a plasmid. Substitution mutations arose at only two of 12 potential priming sites of the DNA primase of the pRN1 replicon, but nearly all these mutations created nonsense (chain termination) codons. The spontaneous mutation rate of plasmid-borne lacS was 175-fold higher under high-expression than under low-expression conditions. The results suggest that important DNA repair or replication fidelity functions are impaired or overwhelmed in pJlacS, with results analogous to those of the "transcription-associated mutagenesis" seen in bacteria and eukaryotes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23564176&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Couto-Alves, Alexessander</author><author>Wright, Victoria J</author><author>Perumal, Karnan</author><author>Binder, Alexander</author><author>Carrol, Enitan D</author><author>Emonts, Marieke</author><author>de Groot, Ronald</author><author>Hazelzet, Jan</author><author>Kuijpers, Taco</author><author>Nadel, Simon</author><author>Zenz, Werner</author><author>Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan</author><author>Levin, Michael</author><author>Coin, Lachlan</author><author>Inwald, David P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A new scoring system derived from base excess and platelet count at presentation predicts mortality in paediatric meningococcal sepsis.</title><secondary-title>Critical care (London, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Critical care (London, England)</full-title><abbr-1>Critical care (London, England)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>R68</pages><volume>17</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Child, Preschool</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Infant, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Meningococcal Infections/*blood</keyword><keyword>Meningococcal Infections/*mortality</keyword><keyword>Meningococcal Infections/diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Mortality/trends</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count/methods</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sepsis/*blood</keyword><keyword>Sepsis/*mortality</keyword><keyword>Sepsis/diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-04-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1466-609X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/cc12609</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction: The aim of this study was to derive a novel prognostic score for mortality in paediatric meningococcal sepsis (MS) based on readily available laboratory markers.; Methods: A multicentre retrospective cohort study for the consortium set and a single centre retrospective study for replication set. The consortium set were 1,073 children (age 1 week to 17.9 years) referred over a 15-year period (1996 to 2011), who had an admission diagnosis of MS, referred to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in six different European centres. The consortium set was split into a development set and validation set to derive the score. The replication set were 134 children with MS (age 2 weeks to 16 years) referred over a 4-year period (2007 to 2011) to PICUs via the Children's Acute Transport Service (CATS), London.; Results: A total of 85/1,073 (7.9%) children in the consortium set died. A total of 16/134 (11.9%) children in the replication set died. Children dying in the consortium set had significantly lower base excess, C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet and white cell count, more deranged coagulation and higher lactate than survivors. Paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score, Glasgow meningococcal septicaemia prognosis score (GMSPS) and Rotterdam score were also higher. Using the consortium set, a new scoring system using base excess and platelet count at presentation, termed the BEP score, was mathematically developed and validated. BEP predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity scores (area under the curve (AUC) in the validation set=0.86 and in the replication set=0.96). In the validation set, BEP score performance (AUC=0.86, confidence interval (CI): 0.80 to 0.91) was better than GMSPS (AUC=0.77, CI: 0.68, 0.85), similar to Rotterdam (AUC=0.87, CI: 0.81 to 0.93) and not as good as PRISM (AUC=0.93, CI: 0.85 to 0.97).; Conclusions: The BEP score, relying on only two variables that are quickly and objectively measurable and readily available at presentation, is highly sensitive and specific in predicting death from MS in childhood.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23577792&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Byford, Sarah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The validity and responsiveness of the EQ-5D measure of health-related quality of life in an adolescent population with persistent major depression.</title><secondary-title>Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>101-110</pages><volume>22</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/methods</keyword><keyword>Depressive Disorder, Major/*diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Depressive Disorder, Major/*psychology</keyword><keyword>Depressive Disorder, Major/therapy</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Health Status*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment, Health Care</keyword><keyword>Psychometrics</keyword><keyword>Quality of Life/*psychology</keyword><keyword>Quality-Adjusted Life Years</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1360-0567</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3109/09638237.2013.779366</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Despite a preference for economic evaluations to measure outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years, generic measures of outcome are rarely used in mental health research involving young people.; Aims: To explore the validity and responsiveness of the EQ-5D measure of health-related quality of life in adolescents with major depression.; Method: Data came from a clinical trial involving adolescents with persistent major depression (n =â 199). Construct validity was tested using socio-demographic constructs and baseline clinical outcome scores. To assess convergent validity, correlation between EQ-5D and clinical outcome scores was tested. To assess responsiveness, the mean change in EQ-5D scores of participants categorised as improved versus not improved on clinical outcome measures was tested.; Results: Significant differences in mean EQ-5D score were found for co-morbidity and three of four severity measures but not gender, age, treatment history or suicide attempts. Mean EQ-5D scores were significantly correlated with all clinical outcome measures, although relationships were moderate or weak. A change in mean EQ-5D score was significantly related to clinical assessments of improvement on all outcome measures.; Conclusions: Results provide initial evidence to support the relevance of the EQ-5D in adolescents with major depression, but this evidence is weak.

Such a process has been realized with a pair of self-replicating RNA enzymes that undergo exponential amplification at a constant temperature. Exponential growth requires that the rate of production of new enzymes be directly proportional to the existing concentration of enzymes, which is the case for this system and provides a doubling time of ~20 min. However, the catalytic rate of the underlying enzymes is ~100-fold faster than the observed rate of replication. As in biological replication, other aspects of the system limit the generation time, chiefly the propensity of the substrate molecules to form nonproductive complexes that limit their availability for replication. An analysis of this and other kinetic properties of the self-replicating RNA enzymes reveals how exponential amplification is achieved and how the rate of amplification might be increased.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23384307&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Mingzhi</author><author>Zhang, Xudong</author><author>Han, Zhiqiang</author><author>Chen, Xinfeng</author><author>Yang, Li</author><author>Sheng, Yuqiao</author><author>Wen, Jianguo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Construction of a novel oncolytic adenoviral vector and its biological characteristics.</title><secondary-title>Oncology reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncology reports</full-title><abbr-1>Oncology reports</abbr-1></periodical><pages>798-804</pages><volume>29</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Acyclovir/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Adenoviridae/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Adenoviridae/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Adenoviridae/physiology</keyword><keyword>Adenovirus E1A Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Antiviral Agents/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Bone Neoplasms/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Cell Line, Tumor</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Ganciclovir/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Gene Amplification</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Genetic Therapy</keyword><keyword>Genetic Vectors*</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Osteosarcoma/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins</keyword><keyword>Telomerase/genetics</keyword><keyword>Terminal Repeat Sequences</keyword><keyword>Thymidine Kinase/genetics</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1791-2431</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/or.2012.2140</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this study, we aimed to construct an effective and safe oncolytic adenoviral vector for cancer treatment with gene therapy. First, the promoter of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERTp), adenovirus early region 1a gene (E1A) and thymidine kinase gene of human herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1-TK) were amplified by using PCR from genomic DNA of 293A cells and wild-type HSV-1 (wHSV-1). These specially-prepared elements were inserted into an adenoviral shuttle vector in the opposite and the same directions of left inverted terminal repeat (L-ITR), respectively, to construct pENTR-E1A-IRES-TK-hTERTp (pEITH) and pENTR-hTERTp-E1A-IRES-TK (pHEIT). LR reaction between adenoviral shuttle vectors (pEITH and pHEIT) and the backbone vector DEST was carried out to establish adenoviral expression vectors pAd-E1A-IRES-TK-hTERTp (pAd-EITH) and pAd-hTERTp-E1A-IRES-TK (pAd-HEIT). Recombinant adenovirus Ad-EITH and Ad-HEIT were produced by transfecting 293A cells and purified for the subsequent studies of titer measurement, replication capability with and without acyclovir (ACV) and antitumor ability with and without ganciclovir (GCV) to evaluate the biological characteristics. Adenoviral shuttle vectors pEITH and pHEIT and expression vectors pAd-EITH and pAd-HEIT were successfully constructed, and recombinant adenoviruses Ad-EITH and Ad-HEIT with high titer were produced. The results of replication and cytotoxicity assays showed that Ad-EITH and Ad-HEIT replicated in the hTERTp (+) human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE and expressed the TK gene effectively leading to the death of tumor cells. In addition, there were still some Ad-HEIT particles replicating in the hTERTp (-) human osteosarcoma U-2OS cells and human lung HFL-1 fibroblasts compared to Ad-EITH which was hardly able to replicate in U-2OS and HFL-1 cells. In addition, we also observed an interesting phenomenon, that the replication of Ad-EITH could be inhibited by antiviral drug ACV on account of the expression of HSV-1-TK gene making Ad-EITH sensitive to ACV. In conclusion, a novel oncolytic adenoviral vector Ad-EITH was produced which can be used for cancer-specific and efficient viral replication, and its safety is potentially improved as replication can be inhibited by ACV in vitro.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23165979&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allerson, Matt</author><author>Deen, John</author><author>Detmer, Susan E</author><author>Gramer, Marie R</author><author>Joo, Han Soo</author><author>Romagosa, Anna</author><author>Torremorell, Montserrat</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of maternally derived immunity on influenza A virus transmission in neonatal pig populations.</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title><abbr-1>Vaccine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>500-505</pages><volume>31</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Basic Reproduction Number</keyword><keyword>Disease Transmission, Infectious/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Immunity, Maternally-Acquired*</keyword><keyword>Influenza A virus/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Orthomyxoviridae Infections/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Orthomyxoviridae Infections/transmission</keyword><keyword>Orthomyxoviridae Infections/virology</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/*transmission</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/virology</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-01-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1873-2518</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.023</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The commonality of influenza A virus (IAV) exposure and vaccination on swine farms in the United States ensures that the majority of neonatal pigs will have some degree of maternal immunity to IAV. The influence of maternal immunity on IAV transmission in neonatal pig populations will impact virus prevalence and infection dynamics across pig populations. The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of maternally derived immunity on IAV transmission in an experimental setting. Neonatal pigs suckled colostrum and derived maternal (passive) immunity from sows in one of three treatment groups: (a) non-vaccinated control (CTRL) or vaccinated with (b) homologous (PASSV-HOM) or (c) heterologous (PASSV-HET) inactivated experimental IAV vaccines. Sentinel neonatal pigs derived from the groups above were challenged with IAV via direct contact with an experimentally infected pig (seeder pig) and monitored for IAV infection daily via nasal swab sampling. A susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) experimental model was used to obtain and estimate transmission parameters in each treatment group via a generalized linear model. All sentinel pigs in the CTRL (30/30) and PASSV-HET (30/30) groups were infected with IAV following contact with the seeder pigs and the reproduction ratio estimates (95% confidence interval) were 10.4 (6.6-15.8) and 7.1 (4.2-11.3), respectively. In contrast, 1/20 sentinel pigs in the PASSV-HOM group was infected following contact with the seeder pigs and the reproduction ratio estimate was significantly lower compared to the CTRL and PASSV-HET groups at 0.8 (0.1-3.7). Under the conditions of this study, IAV transmission was reduced in neonatal pigs with homologous maternal immunity compared to seronegative neonatal pigs and pigs with heterologous maternal immunity as defined in this study. This study provides estimates for IAV transmission in pigs with differing types of maternal immunity which may describe the influence of maternal immunity on IAV prevalence and infection dynamics in pig populations.

Here we present the first GC-Py-IRMS Î´(18)O results for trimethylsilyl-derivatives of plant sap-relevant sugars and a polyalcohol (glucose, fructose, sucrose, raffinose and pinitol). Particularly, we focus on sucrose, which is assimilated in leaves and which is the most important transport sugar in plants and hence of utmost relevance in plant physiology and paleoclimate studies. Replication measurements of sucrose standards and concentration series indicate that the GC-Py-IRMS Î´(18)O measurements are not stable over time and that they are amount (area) dependent. We, therefore, suggest running sample batch replication measurements in alternation with standard concentration series of reference material. This allows for carrying out (i) a drift correction, (ii) a calibration against reference material and (iii) an amount (area) correction. Tests with (18)O-enriched water do not provide any evidence for oxygen isotope exchange reactions affecting sucrose and raffinose. We present the first application of GC-Py-IRMS Î´(18)O analysis for sucrose from needle extract (soluble carbohydrate) samples. The obtained Î´(18)Osucrose/ Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) values are more positive and vary in a wider range (32.1-40.1 â°) than the Î´(18)Obulk/ VSMOW values (24.6-27.2 â°). Furthermore, they are shown to depend on the climate parameters maximum day temperature, relative air humidity and cloud cover. These findings suggest that Î´(18)Osucrose of the investigated needles very sensitively reflects the climatically controlled evaporative (18)O enrichment of leaf water and thus highlights the great potential of GC-Py-IRMS Î´(18)Osucrose analysis for plant physiology and paleoclimate studies.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24313371&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Capobianchi, M R</author><author>Giombini, E</author><author>Rozera, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Next-generation sequencing technology in clinical virology.</title><secondary-title>Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases</full-title><abbr-1>Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases</abbr-1></periodical><pages>15-22</pages><volume>19</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods</keyword><keyword>High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*trends</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Metagenome</keyword><keyword>Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods</keyword><keyword>Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*trends</keyword><keyword>Virology/*methods</keyword><keyword>Virology/*trends</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1469-0691</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1469-0691.12056</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent advances in nucleic acid sequencing technologies, referred to as 'next-generation' sequencing (NGS), have produced a true revolution and opened new perspectives for research and diagnostic applications, owing to the high speed and throughput of data generation. So far, NGS has been applied to metagenomics-based strategies for the discovery of novel viruses and the characterization of viral communities. Additional applications include whole viral genome sequencing, detection of viral genome variability, and the study of viral dynamics. These applications are particularly suitable for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitisÂ B virus, and hepatitisÂ C virus, whose error-prone replication machinery, combined with the high replication rate, results, in each infected individual, in the formation of many genetically related viral variants referred to as quasi-species. The viral quasi-species, in turn, represents the substrate for the selective pressure exerted by the immune system or by antiviral drugs. With traditional approaches, it is difficult to detect and quantify minority genomes present in viral quasi-species that, in fact, may have biological and clinical relevance. NGS provides, for each patient, a dataset of clonal sequences that is some order of magnitude higher than those obtained with conventional approaches. Hence, NGS is an extremely powerful tool with which to investigate previously inaccessible aspects of viral dynamics, such as the contribution of different viral reservoirs to replicating virus in the course of the natural history of the infection, co-receptor usage in minority viral populations harboured by different cell lineages, the dynamics of development of drug resistance, and the re-emergence of hidden genomes after treatment interruptions. The diagnostic application of NGS is just around the corner.

Previous studies examining the nature of this cost suggested a possible involvement of oxidative stress resulting from the imbalance between pro- and anti-oxidant processes. Still, data remain conflictory probably because, although oxidative damage increases during reproduction, high systemic levels of oxidative stress might also constrain parental investment in reproduction. Here, we investigated variation in oxidative balance (i.e. oxidative damage and antioxidant defences) over the course of reproduction by comparing female laboratory mice rearing or not pups.; Results: A significant increase in oxidative damage over time was only observed in females caring for offspring, whereas antioxidant defences increased over time regardless of reproductive status. Interestingly, oxidative damage measured prior to reproduction was negatively associated with litter size at birth (constraint), whereas damage measured after reproduction was positively related to litter size at weaning (cost).; Conclusions: Globally, our correlative results and the review of literature describing the links between reproduction and oxidative stress underline the importance of timing/dynamics when studying and interpreting oxidative balance in relation to reproduction. Our study highlights the duality (constraint and cost) of oxidative stress in life-history trade-offs, thus supporting the theory that oxidative stress plays a key role in life-history evolution.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23268929&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Charpin, CÃ©line</author><author>MahÃ©, Sophie</author><author>Keranflec'h, AndrÃ©</author><author>Belloc, Catherine</author><author>Cariolet, Roland</author><author>Le Potier, Marie-FrÃ©dÃ©rique</author><author>Rose, Nicolas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Infectiousness of pigs infected by the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) is time-dependent.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary research</full-title><abbr-1>Veterinary research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>69</pages><volume>43</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Viral/*blood</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Genome, Viral*</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological</keyword><keyword>Nose/virology</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome/*transmission</keyword><keyword>Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome/virology</keyword><keyword>Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Random Allocation</keyword><keyword>Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Virus Shedding*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-10-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1297-9716</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1297-9716-43-69</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The time-dependent transmission rate of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) and the correlation between infectiousness, virological parameters and antibody responses of the infected pigs were studied in experimental conditions. Seven successive transmission trials involving a total of 77 specific pathogen-free piglets were carried out from 7 to 63 days post-inoculation (dpi). A semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR was developed to assess the evolution of the viral genome load in blood and nasal swabs from inoculated and contact pigs, with time. Virus genome in blood was detectable in inoculated pigs from 7 to 77 dpi, whereas viral genome shedding was detectable from nasal swabs from 2 to 48 dpi. The infectiousness of inoculated pigs, assessed from the frequency of occurrence of infected pigs in susceptible groups in each contact trial, increased from 7 to 14 dpi and then decreased slowly until 42 dpi (3, 7, 2, 1 and 0 pigs infected at 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 dpi, respectively). These data were used to model the time-dependent infectiousness by a lognormal-like function with a latency period of 1 day and led to an estimated basic reproduction ratio, R0 of 2.6 [1.8, 3.3]. The evolution of infectiousness was mainly correlated with the time-course of viral genome load in the blood whereas the decrease of infectiousness was strongly related to the increase in total antibodies.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23061672&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reinboth, Jennifer</author><author>Ascierto, Maria L</author><author>Chen, Nanhai G</author><author>Zhang, Qian</author><author>Yu, Yong A</author><author>Aguilar, Richard J</author><author>Carretero, Rafael</author><author>Worschech, Andrea</author><author>Zhao, Yingdong</author><author>Wang, Ena</author><author>Marincola, Francesco M</author><author>Szalay, Aladar A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Correlates between host and viral transcriptional program associated with different oncolytic vaccinia virus isolates.</title><secondary-title>Human gene therapy methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human gene therapy methods</full-title><abbr-1>Human gene therapy methods</abbr-1></periodical><pages>285-296</pages><volume>23</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cluster Analysis</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Viral</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation*</keyword><keyword>Gene Regulatory Networks</keyword><keyword>Host-Pathogen Interactions/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Oncolytic Viruses/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Transcription, Genetic*</keyword><keyword>Vaccinia virus/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1946-6544</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/hgtb.2012.057</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Vaccinia virus (VACV) has emerged as an attractive tool in oncolytic virotherapy. VACV replication efficiency plays a crucial role in the therapeutic outcome. However, little is known about the influence of host factors on viral replication efficiency and permissiveness of a host cell line to infection and oncolysis. In this study, replication of the attenuated VACV GLV-1h68 strain and three wild-type VACV isolates was determined in two autologous human melanoma cell lines (888-MEL and 1936-MEL). Host gene expression and viral gene expression in infected cells were evaluated via respective expression array platforms. Microarray analyses followed by sequential statistical approaches characterized human genes that change specifically due to virus infection. Viral gene transcription correlated with viral replication in a time-dependent manner. A set of human genes revealed strong correlations with the respective viral gene expression. Finally we identified a set of human genes with possible predictive value for viral replication in an independent dataset. The results demonstrate a probable correlation between viral replication, early gene expression, and the respective host response, and thus a possible involvement of human host factors in viral early replication. The characterization of human target genes that influence viral replication could help answer the question of host cell permissiveness to oncolytic virotherapy and provide important information for the development of novel recombinant vaccinia viruses with improved features to enhance replication rate and hence trigger therapeutic outcome.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23131031&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitterhofer, A P</author><author>Umbro, I</author><author>Pietropaolo, V</author><author>MeÃ§ule, A</author><author>Russo, G E</author><author>Tinti, F</author><author>Fiacco, F</author><author>Poli, L</author><author>Bellizzi, A</author><author>Anzivino, E</author><author>Ferretti, G</author><author>Berloco, P B</author><author>Chiarini, F</author><author>Taliani, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polyomavirus BK infection in end-stage renal disease: analysis of viral replication in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</title><secondary-title>Transplantation proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Transplantation proceedings</full-title><abbr-1>Transplantation proceedings</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1869-1872</pages><volume>44</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>BK Virus/*isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>BK Virus/physiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kidney Failure, Chronic/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Peritoneal Dialysis*</keyword><keyword>Polyomavirus Infections/*complications</keyword><keyword>Renal Dialysis*</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1873-2623</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.06.021</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Patients in end-stage renal disease undergoing renal replacement treatment (ESRD-RRT) are considered immunocompromised. The hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) procedures seem to produce alterations of the immune status. Interest in immunosuppression has increased due to the poliomavirus BK (BKV) infection. Our study evaluated the prevalence of BKV infection in ESRD-RRT patients and viral replication on HD or PD. From 2006 to 2011 we selected 58 patients (34 males) in ESRD-RRT for inclusion in our study. BKV replication was evaluated by qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In ESRD-RRT patients, the prevalence of BKV replication on plasma was 21%. We identified two groups of patients according to the dialysis procedure: 36 patients on HD (HD group) and 22 on PD (PD group). BKV replication in the HD group was 33% (12 of 36) versus 0% (0 of 22) in the PD group. Different age, number of months on RRT, and preserved diuresis was observed in the HD versus PD groups. With our results we can speculate that BKV infection in ESRD-RRT patients is linked to factors involved in the uremia-related immune dysfunction but also to specific mechanisms related to the different RRTs. PD is an option that could be associated with a better transplant outcome for patients undergoing kidney transplantation. (Copyright Â© 2012.

The Ca concentration in bronchial epithelial cells is an important factor for bronchoconstriction. Human annexin A4 (ANXA4) is predominantly expressed in the secretory epithelia in the lung, stomach, intestine, and kidney. Furthermore, translocation and induction of ANXA4 have been observed in human Ca-depleted neutrophils. To investigate the association between annexin A4 polymorphisms and the risk of AERD, we have genotyped 21 variants from 102 AERD subjects and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) controls. Logistic analyses controlling for sex, smoking status, and atopy as covariates were performed to estimate the association between the annexin A4 polymorphisms and AERD. Among these variants, 8 polymorphisms (rs2168116, rs4853017, rs6546547, rs13428251, rs7577864, rs7559354, rs7588022, and rs3816491) and 2 haplotypes (ANXA4-ht3 and ANXA4-ht5) were significantly associated with the risk of AERD. One common polymorphism in intron 11, rs3816491, showed the strongest association signal with susceptibility to aspirin-AERD even after multiple testing corrections (OR=0.57; 95% confidence interval 0.40-0.83; P=0.003; P=0.045 in the codominant model). Although further functional evaluations of replication studies in larger cohorts are required, our findings suggest that the annexin A4 could have susceptibility for AERD.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22847161&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leng, Shuguang</author><author>Do, Kieu</author><author>Yingling, Christin M</author><author>Picchi, Maria A</author><author>Wolf, Holly J</author><author>Kennedy, Timothy C</author><author>Feser, William J</author><author>Baron, Anna E</author><author>Franklin, Wilbur A</author><author>Brock, Malcolm V</author><author>Herman, James G</author><author>Baylin, Stephen B</author><author>Byers, Tim</author><author>Stidley, Christine A</author><author>Belinsky, Steven A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Defining a gene promoter methylation signature in sputum for lung cancer risk assessment.</title><secondary-title>Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</full-title><abbr-1>Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3387-3395</pages><volume>18</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>DNA Methylation*</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung Neoplasms/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions, Genetic*</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>Sputum/*cytology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-06-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1557-3265</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3049</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: To evaluate the methylation state of 31 genes in sputum as biomarkers in an expanded nested, case-control study from the Colorado cohort, and to assess the replication of results from the most promising genes in an independent case-control study of asymptomatic patients with stage I lung cancer from New Mexico.; Experimental Design: Cases and controls from Colorado and New Mexico were interrogated for methylation of up to 31 genes using nested, methylation-specific PCR. Individual genes and methylation indices were used to assess the association between methylation and lung cancer with logistic regression modeling.; Results: Seventeen genes with ORs of 1.4 to 3.6 were identified and selected for replication in the New Mexico study. Overall, the direction of effects seen in New Mexico was similar to Colorado with the largest increase in case discrimination (ORs, 3.2-4.2) seen for the PAX5Î±, GATA5, and SULF2 genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves generated from seven-gene panels from Colorado and New Mexico studies showed prediction accuracy of 71% and 77%, respectively. A 22-fold increase in lung cancer risk was seen for a subset of New Mexico cases with five or more genes methylated. Sequence variants associated with lung cancer did not improve the accuracy of this gene methylation panel.; Conclusions: These studies have identified and replicated a panel of methylated genes whose integration with other promising biomarkers could initially identify the highest risk smokers for computed tomographic screening for early detection of lung cancer.

It is well-known that the fertility of schizophrenic patients, particularly males, has always been below the population average. The main measures of fertility are marriage rate, marital fertility, and rate of reproduction. Studies have shown the rate of reproduction of schizophrenic patients to be 30â80% of the general population, the reduction being mainly due to reduced probability of marriage. However, at least 1 investigation presented evidence for an increase in marriage rate and rate of reproduction in schizophrenic patients relative to the general population in recent time. The hypothesis of a compensatory higher fertility of healthy relatives of schizophrenics based on a physiological advantage is empirically unproven. Additionally, the concept of a balanced polymorphism in schizophrenia rests on a superficial analogy with Mendelian traits. Therefore, the relative increase of fertility in schizophrenics remains unconfirmed.

Our models consider different replication modes ranging between two extremes represented by the geometric replication (GR) and the linear stamping machine replication (SMR). We first analyse a model that quantitatively reproduced experimental data for the accumulation dynamics of both polarities of turnip mosaic potyvirus RNAs. We identify a non-degenerate transcritical bifurcation governing the extinction of both strands depending on three key parameters: the mode of replication (Î±), the replication rate (r) and the degradation rate (Î´) of viral strands. Our results indicate that the bifurcation associated with Î± generically takes place when the replication mode is closer to the SMR, thus suggesting that GR may provide viral strands with an increased robustness against degradation. This transcritical bifurcation, which is responsible for the switching from an active to an absorbing regime, suggests a smooth (i.e. second-order), absorbing-state phase transition. Finally, we also analyse a simplified model that only incorporates asymmetry in replication tied to differential replication modes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21900320&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mudumbai, Seshadri C</author><author>Gaba, David M</author><author>Boulet, John R</author><author>Howard, Steven K</author><author>Davies, M Frances</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>External validation of simulation-based assessments with other performance measures of third-year anesthesiology residents.</title><secondary-title>Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare</full-title><abbr-1>Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare</abbr-1></periodical><pages>73-80</pages><volume>7</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Anesthesiology/*education</keyword><keyword>Clinical Competence*</keyword><keyword>Education, Medical, Graduate/*methods</keyword><keyword>Educational Measurement/methods</keyword><keyword>Educational Status</keyword><keyword>Faculty, Medical</keyword><keyword>Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Internship and Residency*</keyword><keyword>Learning</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Statistics as Topic</keyword><keyword>Teaching/*methods</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1559-713X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/SIH.0b013e31823d018a</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction: There has been interest in the use of high-fidelity medical simulation to evaluate performance. We hypothesized that technical and nontechnical performance in the simulated environment is related to other various criterion measures, providing evidence to support the validity of the scores from the performance-based assessment.; Methods: Twelve third-year anesthesia residents participated in a series of 6 short 5-minute scenarios and 1 longer 30-minute scenario. The short scenarios measured technical skills, whereas the longer one focused on nontechnical skills. Two independent raters scored subjects using analytic and holistic ratings. Short scenarios involved acute hemorrhage, blocked endotracheal tube, bronchospasm, hyperkalemia, tension pneumothorax, and unstable ventricular tachycardia. The long scenario concerned management of myocardial ischemia/infarction leading to cardiac arrest. Scores from the simulations were correlated with (a) rankings generated from an Internet-based global ranking instrument that categorized residents based on overall clinical ability and (b) residency board scores.; Results: There were moderate correlations between various participant scores from the simulation-based assessment and aggregate rankings based on the global ranking instrument and residency examination scores.; Conclusions: The associations between simulator performance, both for technical and nontechnical skills, and other markers of ability provide some evidence to support the validity of simulation-based assessment scores. Replication studies with larger numbers of residents are warranted.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22374230&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Yinshi</author><author>Li, Wei</author><author>Wang, Jianhua</author><author>Bi, Jianjie</author><author>Su, Shudong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determination of rutin in cigarette tobacco, filters, mainstream smoke and burned ash of different branded cigarettes by high performance liquid chromatography.</title><secondary-title>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</full-title><abbr-1>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3751-3760</pages><volume>17</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid*</keyword><keyword>Nicotiana/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Rutin/*analysis</keyword><keyword>Smoke/*analysis</keyword><keyword>Solid Phase Extraction/methods</keyword><keyword>Solvents</keyword><keyword>Sonication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-03-26</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1420-3049</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/molecules17043751</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Tobacco consists of at least 3,800 chemical constituents. Among them, rutin is an important polyphenolic secondary metabolite in tobacco, which has positive actions such as antiallergic, anti-inflammatory and vasoactive, antitumor, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-protozoal properties. A high performance liquid chromatography method was used to analyze rutin in tobacco and filters, mainstream smoke, and burned ash of ten varieties of cigarettes made in China. The chromatographic analysis was performed on a Hypersil ODS2 column with a gradient elution of acetonitrile and water at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Detection was carried out at 350 nm using a photodiode array detector. The calibration curves for the determination of analytes showed good linearity over the investigated ranges (R2 &gt; 0.9998). Precision and reproducibility were evaluated by six replicated analyses, and the R.S.D. values were less than 0.59% and 1.53%. The recoveries were between 98.47 and 100.84%. Under the optimized conditions, namely 45 mL/g of solvent to solid ratio, 30 min of extraction time and 200 W of ultrasound power, the concentrations of rutin in tobacco and filter, mainstream smoke, burned ash of different brands cigarettes were 10.20-63.98, 0.10-0.32, 0.06-0.16 and 0 Î¼g/per cigarette, respectively.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22450684&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hartshorne, Joshua K</author><author>Schachner, Adena</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tracking replicability as a method of post-publication open evaluation.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in computational neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in computational neuroscience</full-title><abbr-1>Frontiers in computational neuroscience</abbr-1></periodical><pages>8</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>open evaluation</keyword><keyword>post-publication evaluation</keyword><keyword>replicability</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-03-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1662-5188</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fncom.2012.00008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent reports have suggested that many published results are unreliable. To increase the reliability and accuracy of published papers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes in statistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe that the incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for such reforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality of individual scientists is judged on the basis of their number of publications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbers of citations. Neither of these measures takes into account the replicability of the published findings, as false or controversial results are often particularly widely cited. We propose tracking replications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to help researchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize the publication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires a database linking published studies that replicate one another. As any such database is limited by the number of replication attempts published, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated to publishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database and the affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination of crowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database are aggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicability scores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate the quality of work published in individual journals. In this paper, we lay out a detailed description of how this system could be implemented, including mechanisms for compiling the information, ensuring data quality, and incentivizing the research community to participate.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22403538&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olsson, Jan A</author><author>Berg, Otto</author><author>NordstrÃ¶m, Kurt</author><author>Dasgupta, Santanu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eclipse period of R1 plasmids during downshift from elevated copy number: Nonrandom selection of copies for replication.</title><secondary-title>Plasmid</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plasmid</full-title><abbr-1>Plasmid</abbr-1></periodical><pages>191-198</pages><volume>67</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Chromosomes, Bacterial</keyword><keyword>DNA Copy Number Variations*</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/genetics</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>R Factors/*genetics</keyword><keyword>R Factors/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1095-9890</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.plasmid.2012.01.007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The classical Meselson-Stahl density-shift method was used to study replication of pOU71, a runaway-replication derivative of plasmid R1 in Escherichia coli. The miniplasmid maintained the normal low copy number of R1 during steady growth at 30Â°C, but as growth temperatures were raised above 34Â°C, the copy number of the plasmid increased to higher levels, and at 42Â°C, it replicated without control in a runaway replication mode with lethal consequences for the host. The eclipse periods (minimum time between successive replication of the same DNA) of the plasmid shortened with rising copy numbers at increasing growth temperatures (Olsson et al., 2003). In this work, eclipse periods were measured during downshifts in copy number of pOU71 after it had replicated at 39 and 42Â°C, resulting in 7- and 50-fold higher than normal plasmid copy number per cell, respectively. Eclipse periods for plasmid replication, measured during copy number downshift, suggested that plasmid R1, normally selected randomly for replication, showed a bias such that a newly replicated DNA had a higher probability of replication compared to the bulk of the R1 population. However, even the unexpected nonrandom replication followed the copy number kinetics such that every generation, the plasmids underwent the normal inherited number of replication, n, independent of the actual number of plasmid copies in a newborn cell.

Quality parameters (conversion rate, call rate, reproducibility and concordance) were at the same levels as when genotype calls were acquired using the previous protocol. Multiplex PCR with 192 pairs of locus-specific primers was available for target preparation in the DigiTag2 assay without the optimization of reaction conditions, and quality parameters had the same levels as those acquired with 96-plex PCR. The locus-specific primers were able to achieve sufficient (concentration of target amplicon â¥5 nM) and specific (concentration of unexpected amplicons &lt;2 nM) amplification within 2 hours, were also able to achieve detectable amplifications even when working in a 96-plex or 192-plex form. The improved DigiTag2 assay will be an efficient platform for screening an intermediate number of SNPs (tens to hundreds of sites) in the replication analysis after genome-wide association study. Moreover, highly parallel and short-acting amplification with locus-specific primers may thus facilitate widespread application to other PCR-based assays.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22253840&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shin, Eun-Seok</author><author>Garcia-Garcia, Hector M</author><author>Sarno, Giovanna</author><author>Thuesen, Leif</author><author>Dudek, Dariusz</author><author>Ormiston, John A</author><author>Serruys, Patrick W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility of Shin's method for necrotic core and calcium content in atherosclerotic coronary lesions treated with bioresorbable everolimus-eluting vascular scaffolds using volumetric intravascular ultrasound radiofrequency-based analysis.</title><secondary-title>The international journal of cardiovascular imaging</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The international journal of cardiovascular imaging</full-title><abbr-1>The international journal of cardiovascular imaging</abbr-1></periodical><pages>43-49</pages><volume>28</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Absorbable Implants</keyword><keyword>Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Atherosclerosis/*diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>Atherosclerosis/pathology</keyword><keyword>Cardiovascular Agents/administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Coronary Artery Disease/*diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>Coronary Artery Disease/pathology</keyword><keyword>Coronary Artery Disease/therapy</keyword><keyword>Coronary Vessels/diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>Coronary Vessels/pathology</keyword><keyword>Drug-Eluting Stents*</keyword><keyword>Everolimus</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Necrosis</keyword><keyword>Observer Variation</keyword><keyword>Prosthesis Design</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sirolimus/*analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Sirolimus/administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography, Interventional/*methods</keyword><keyword>Vascular Calcification/*diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>Vascular Calcification/pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1875-8312</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10554-010-9779-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although Virtual Histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) is increasingly used in clinical research, the reproducibility of plaque composition remains unexplored in significant coronary artery and stented lesions. The purpose of this study was to assess the reproducibility of necrotic core and calcium content in atherosclerotic coronary lesions that were treated with a bioresorbable everolimus-eluting vascular scaffold (BVS) using a new measurement method (Shin's method) by VH-IVUS. Eight patients treated with a BVS (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were analyzed with serial VH-IVUS assessments, i.e., pre- and post-stenting, and at 6 months and 2 years follow-up. A total of 32 coronary segments were imaged to evaluate the reproducibility of volumetric VH-IVUS measurements. In Shin's method, contours are drawn around the IVUS catheter (instead of the lumen) and vessel. Overall, in the imaged coronary segment, for necrotic core and dense calcium volumes, the relative intra-observer differences were 0.30 Â± 0.22, 0.19 Â± 0.16% for observer 1 and 0.45 Â± 0.41, 0.36 Â± 0.47% for observer 2, respectively. The inter-observer relative differences of necrotic core and dense calcium volumes were 0.51 Â± 0.79 and 0.56 Â± 1.01%, respectively. The present study demonstrates a good reproducibility for both, intra-observer and inter-observer measurements using Shin's method. This method is suitable for the measurement of necrotic core and dense calcium using VH-IVUS in longitudinal studies, especially studies on bioresorbable scaffolds, because the degradation process will be fully captured independently of the location of the struts and their greyscale appearance.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21229393&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pejsak, Z</author><author>Kusior, G</author><author>Pomorska-MÃ³l, M</author><author>PodgÃ³rska, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of long-term vaccination of a breeding herd of pigs against PCV2 on reproductive parameters.</title><secondary-title>Polish journal of veterinary sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Polish journal of veterinary sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Polish journal of veterinary sciences</abbr-1></periodical><pages>37-42</pages><volume>15</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Circoviridae Infections/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Circoviridae Infections/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Circovirus/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunization Schedule</keyword><keyword>Immunization, Secondary</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Reproduction/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Vaccination</keyword><keyword>Viral Vaccines/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Viral Vaccines/administration &amp; dosage</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1505-1773</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2478/v10181-011-0111-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The objective of the study was to evaluate an efficacy of sows vaccination protocols in the herd with serious problems affecting efficacy of reproduction. The study was performed in a large pig herd with about 1200 sows. Before vaccination against PCV2, farrowing rate in this farm was about 65%. Sows, boar and replacement gilts were immunized using Circovac vaccine (Merial, France) according to producer's recommendations. Parameters of production were analyzed since 2007 until 2010 in selected batches of sows inseminated at the same weeks of the year (17th, 18th, 19th and 20th) to eliminate seasonal variability. In total, 940 sows were subjected to the study. No significant changes in management during these years were introduced. The applied protocol of sow herd long-term vaccination proved to be very efficient. All measured production parameters: reproduction rate, number of piglets born alive, birth weight of piglets and number of piglets weaned per a litter improved after implementation of immunization program. Moreover, further improvement was observed with vaccination in the following reproduction cycles. The most spectacular effect of vaccination regarded average farrowing rate that increased from 64.76% in control group to 86.93% after basic vaccination. Two years after implementation of vaccination program this parameter reached 93.6%. Number of piglets weaned per sow per a litter improved from 10.31 to 11.74 after one year of vaccination and remained relatively stable through the following year. Simultaneously, the percentage of newborn piglets with birth weight &lt; 1 kg decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05). To summarize, vaccination against PCV2 influenced positively the insemination rate, number of piglets born alive and weaned per litter as well as birth body weight and percentage of piglets weighing &lt; 1 kg.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22708355&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Diment, A V</author><author>Blinova, M I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Effect of cycloheximide on DNA replication.

Coating with poly-L-lysine (PLL) alone or with PLL followed by collagen does not enhance myogenicity. Both myogenic and nonmyogenic cells, as distinguished by a monoclonal antibody specific for desmin, attach equally well to collagen- and laminin-coated surfaces, but there is a two- to five-fold increase in the number of myogenic cells on PLL/Lam by 72 hr, followed by increased myotube formation. To determine whether this increase in myogenic cells was a consequence of a selective increase in proliferation on PLL/Lam, incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine into DNA followed by labeling with anti-BrdUrd antibody was used as an index of cell proliferation. The results indicate that desmin is expressed in replicating rat myoblasts, and that replication of myogenic cells is greatly enhanced on laminin compared to collagen. The rate of replication of nonmyogenic cells is the same on both substrates. Addition of 10 micrograms/ml laminin to the medium of cells seeded on PLL or collagen has no effect on myogenicity. We conclude that a laminin substrate enhances skeletal myogenesis in vitro by promoting selectively the replication of myoblasts. Cultures prepared from fetuses at 17 and 19 days gestation also show enhanced myogenicity when grown on PLL/Lam, while those from 15-day fetuses do not. Growth and development of fetal myoblasts on collagen were very poor, whereas myoblasts from the newborn rat do proliferate and differentiate on this substrate. Thus myogenic cells at different stages of fetal and neonatal development may require and respond to different extracellular environments. Myotube formation in the E63 clone of L8 rat myoblasts is inhibited by PLL/Lam.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=3297850&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nolen, G A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A reproduction/teratology study of brewed and instant decaffeinated coffees.</title><secondary-title>Journal of toxicology and environmental health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of toxicology and environmental health</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of toxicology and environmental health</abbr-1></periodical><pages>769-783</pages><volume>10</volume><number>4-5</number><issue>4-5</issue><keywords><keyword>Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/*etiology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Weight/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Caffeine/*adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Coffee/*adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Drinking/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lactation/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Organ Size/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Rats, Inbred Strains</keyword><keyword>Reproduction/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Sexual Maturation/drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1982</year><pub-dates><date>1982-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0098-4108</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/15287398209530294</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were given, in place of their drinking water, full-strength or 50 or 25% dilutions of either brewed or instant decaffeinated coffees for about 6 mo from weaning.

We did so because serious doubts have been expressed about the ability of single-subject methodology to address the salient issues of the day. This chapter allays many of these doubts. This chapter reveals that single-subject researchers are far from helpless when investigating generalization and maintenance and identifying the active (and inactive) components in their compound treatments. In fact, a number of powerful strategies are at their disposal--strategies that are not strangers to the armamentarium of single-case researchers. These strategies are in essence nothing more than extensions of the reversal, multiple baseline, and simultaneous and alternating-treatments designs. In the case of the assessment of generalization, these extensions involve little more than the inclusion of continuous measures (or regular probes) of untrained responses throughout the investigation. In the case of the assessment of maintenance, they involve the replacement of a comparison of two or more acquisition procedures with a comparison of two or more maintenance procedures. And in the case of the identification of active (and inactive) components of compound treatments, they involve the aggregation of the findings from a series of single-subject investigations. When the requirements of single-subject designs and their extensions cannot be met, investigators still have available a set of traditional group designs (e.g., factorial and additive designs) for attacking these same issues. Assessment of generalization, maintenance, and the components of compound treatments are not the only salient issues facing behavior therapy today. Another is the widening gap between the researcher and the practitioner (e.g., Barlow, 1980; Wilson, 1981). It is thought by some that single-subject methodology may be the means of bridging this gap; that through single-subject methodology a new breed of practitioner will appear: the empirical clinician (e.g., Barlow et al., 1984; Goldfried, 1984; Hayes, 1981). This new breed of practitioner will be made up of persons who, for economic and pragmatic reasons, are concerned with accountability and who use single-subject designs to achieve it (Barlow et al., 1984). The present chapter does little to help bridge the gap between the researcher and the practitioner; thus, the present chapter does little to help bring about the creation of this new breed of practitioner, the empirical clinician. In fact, the single-subject strategies described in these pages appear to be suitable for use only by the researcher.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=3070487&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Christensen, A P</author><author>Sanders, M R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Habit reversal and differential reinforcement of other behaviour in the treatment of thumb-sucking: an analysis of generalization and side-effects.</title><secondary-title>Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines</abbr-1></periodical><pages>281-295</pages><volume>28</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Awareness</keyword><keyword>Behavior Therapy/*methods</keyword><keyword>Behavior Therapy/adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Child, Preschool</keyword><keyword>Cooperative Behavior</keyword><keyword>Fingersucking/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Generalization, Psychological</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement, Psychology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year><pub-dates><date>1987-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9630</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1469-7610.1987.tb00211.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study evaluated the generalization, maintenance, and negative side-effects of Habit Reversal (HR) and Differential Reinforcement of Other Behaviour (DRO) in the elimination of thumb-sucking.

Few investigators ever have reported a replication of their initial study results, let alone the crossvalidation of such initial results. This article provides results of a four-year replication study of a medical behavioral treatment approach. Comparisons of patients receiving a uniform treatment were made at yearly intervals. A few variables are identified to clarify who will or will not achieve and maintain follow-up sobriety, although it is admitted that our knowledge in this area is still rudimentary. These results affirm for the practitioner today that the alcoholic patient is treatable with a high probability of success. When the outcome of treatment is positive, the diagnosis and referral become crucial for alcoholism just as for other treatable diseases.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=7097964&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leary, K R</author><author>Blair, C D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Japanese encephalitis virus replication: studies on host cell nuclear involvement.</title><secondary-title>Experimental and molecular pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental and molecular pathology</full-title><abbr-1>Experimental and molecular pathology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>264-270</pages><volume>38</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Autoradiography</keyword><keyword>Cell Fractionation</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus/analysis</keyword><keyword>Cytoplasm/analysis</keyword><keyword>Dactinomycin/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Encephalitis Virus, Japanese/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Encephalitis Virus, Japanese/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endoplasmic Reticulum/analysis</keyword><keyword>Mitomycin</keyword><keyword>Mitomycins/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1983</year><pub-dates><date>1983-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0014-4800</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0014-4800(83)90091-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replication, as measured by virus production, of both the flavivirus Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and the alphavirus Venezuelan encephalitis virus (VEV) was unaffected by short pulses of actinomycin D (act D) at early times postinfection (PI).

The Children of Divorce Intervention Program (CODIP) emphasizes support, identifying and expressing divorce-related feelings, training situationally relevant communication, problem solving, and anger control skills, and enhancing self-esteem. Fifty-four children of divorce participated in the 11-session program conducted in small groups. Their adjustment was contrasted at pre and post with that of demographically matched peers (N = 78) from intact families on teacher, parent, self-report, and group leader measures. Children of divorce were less well adjusted than their peers before the intervention. They improved significantly after the intervention, approaching youngsters from intact families in adjustment status. The replication data support CODIP's efficacy as a preventive alternative for children of divorce.

Quantitative description of the molecular control mechanism for initiation of lambda dv replication presumes regulatory functions of repressor and initiator proteins and transcriptional activation of the origin region. Random selection of a single plasmid for activation and replication is assumed, as is regular plasmid segregation to daughter cells. The model is capable of simulating the periodic changes in each regulatory element and the plasmid copy number during the cell cycle. The calculated average copy number, repressor concentration, and timing of plasmid replication agree well with experimental data. The simulated lambda dv plasmid replication rate is controlled primarily by transcription frequency. Initiation of plasmid replication is not related to variations in the levels of repressor or initiator proteins during the cell cycle. Simulation studies of perturbations in plasmid and repressor segregation indicate that replication regulation of the lambda dv plasmid compensates to readjust copy number to normal values in a few generations. Implications of these studies relative to the molecular mechanisms of replication control are discussed.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=6728935&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hand, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deoxyribonucleic acid fiber autoradiography as a technique for studying the replication of the mammalian chromosome.</title><secondary-title>The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society</full-title><abbr-1>The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society</abbr-1></periodical><pages>475-481</pages><volume>23</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Autoradiography/*methods</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cycloheximide/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Isotope Labeling</keyword><keyword>L Cells/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>L Cells/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Puromycin/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Thymidine/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Tritium</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1975</year><pub-dates><date>1975-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-1554</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/23.7.1095649</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fiber autoradiography is a technique that allows analysis of replication events on mammalian chromosomal DNA. 3H-thymidine is used to pulse-label DNA, which is subsequently released from lysed cells and extended linearly over a glass slide. Autoradiograms are produced by exposing the labeled DNA to light-sensitive emulsion. The effects of inhibition of protein synthesis on DNA replication were examined using this technique. Analysis of the autoradiographic patterns has shown that inhibition of protein synthesis with either cycloheximide or puromycin retards the rate of replication fork progression. In addition, these antibiotics after the normal pattern of multifocal initiation on replication units. The spatial interval between active initiation sites is decreased, there is a decay in synchrony of initiation events on subchromosomal clusters of replication units, the decay in synchrony of initiation events on subchromosomal clusters of replication units, the frequency of initiation is inhibited and the frequency of units showing the normal bidirectional mode of replication is decreased. The retarded fork progression and shorter initiation intervals may result either from the continued operation of a subset of replication units resistant to the inhibition of protein synthesis, or be manifestations of the inhibition of protein synthesis on all active sites. The other alterations, decreased synchrony and frequency of initiation and increased unidirectional replication probably occur on all active units when protein synthesis is inhibited.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=1095649&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gaddipati, J P</author><author>Sen, S K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DNA replication studies in genus Vicia through fibre radioautography.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell science</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of cell science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>85-91</pages><volume>29</volume><keywords><keyword>Autoradiography</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus/metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>Plants/*metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1978</year><pub-dates><date>1978-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9533</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jcs.29.1.85</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An experiment has been conducted to study the mode of replication in 3 species of Vicia having different C-values by means of fibre radioautography.

Effort to find antivirals for it has focused on bioflavonoids, a plant-derived polyphenolic compounds with many potential health benefits. In the present study, antiviral activity of four types of bioflavonoid against dengue virus type -2 (DENV-2) in Vero cell was evaluated. Anti-dengue activity of these compounds was determined at different stages of DENV-2 infection and replication cycle. DENV replication was measured by Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) and quantitative RT-PCR. Selectivity Index value (SI) was determined as the ratio of cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) to inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) for each compound.; Results: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of quercetin against dengue virus was 35.7 Î¼g mL-1 when it was used after virus adsorption to the cells. The IC50 decreased to 28.9 Î¼g mL-1 when the cells were treated continuously for 5 h before virus infection and up to 4 days post-infection. The SI values for quercetin were 7.07 and 8.74 Î¼g mL-1, respectively, the highest compared to all bioflavonoids studied. Naringin only exhibited anti-adsorption effects against DENV-2 with IC50 = 168.2 Î¼g mL-1 and its related SI was 1.3. Daidzein showed a weak anti-dengue activity with IC50 = 142.6 Î¼g mL-1 when the DENV-2 infected cells were treated after virus adsorption. The SI value for this compound was 1.03. Hesperetin did not exhibit any antiviral activity against DENV-2. The findings obtained from Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) were corroborated by findings of the qRT-PCR assays. Quercetin and daidzein (50 Î¼g mL-1) reduced DENV-2 RNA levels by 67% and 25%, respectively. There was no significant inhibition of DENV-2 RNA levels with naringin and hesperetin.; Conclusion: Results from the study suggest that only quercetin demonstrated significant anti-DENV-2 inhibitory activities. Other bioflavonoids, including daidzein, naringin and hesperetin showed minimal to no significant inhibition of DENV-2 virus replication. These findings, together with those previously reported suggest that select group of bioflavonoids including quercetin and fisetin, exhibited significant inhibitory activities against dengue virus. This group of flavonoids, flavonol, could be investigated further to discover the common mechanisms of inhibition of dengue virus replication.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22201648&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Faye, Laura L</author><author>Bull, Shelley B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Two-stage study designs combining genome-wide association studies, tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and exome sequencing: accuracy of genetic effect estimates.</title><secondary-title>BMC proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC proceedings</full-title><abbr-1>BMC proceedings</abbr-1></periodical><pages>S64</pages><volume>5 Suppl 9</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-11-29</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1753-6561</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1753-6561-5-S9-S64</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) test for disease-trait associations and estimate effect sizes at tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which imperfectly capture variation at causal SNPs. Sequencing studies can examine potential causal SNPs directly; however, sequencing the whole genome or exome can be prohibitively expensive. Costs can be limited by using a GWAS to detect the associated region(s) at tag SNPs followed by targeted sequencing to identify and estimate the effect size of the causal variant. Genetic effect estimates obtained from association studies can be inflated because of a form of selection bias known as the winner's curse. Conversely, estimates at tag SNPs can be attenuated compared to the causal SNP because of incomplete linkage disequilibrium. These two effects oppose each other. Analysis of rare SNPs further complicates our understanding of the winner's curse because rare SNPs are difficult to tag and analysis can involve collapsing over multiple rare variants. In two-stage analysis of Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 simulated data sets, we find that selection at the tag SNP produces upward bias in the estimate of effect at the causal SNP, even when the tag and causal SNPs are not well correlated. The bias similarly carries through to effect estimates for rare variant summary measures. Replication studies designed with sample sizes computed using biased estimates will be under-powered to detect a disease-causing variant. Accounting for bias in the original study is critical to avoid discarding disease-associated SNPs at follow up.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22373407&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, Huamin</author><author>He, Wen</author><author>Wang, Wei</author><author>Gao, Bin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibitory effect of aqueous Dandelion extract on HIV-1 replication and reverse transcriptase activity.</title><secondary-title>BMC complementary and alternative medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC complementary and alternative medicine</full-title><abbr-1>BMC complementary and alternative medicine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>112</pages><volume>11</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections/virology</keyword><keyword>HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/enzymology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Plant Extracts/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Taraxacum/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/*drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-11-14</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1472-6882</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1472-6882-11-112</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is an immunosuppressive disease that results in life-threatening opportunistic infections. The general problems in current therapy include the constant emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains, adverse side effects and the unavailability of treatments in developing countries. Natural products from herbs with the abilities to inhibit HIV-1 life cycle at different stages, have served as excellent sources of new anti-HIV-1 drugs. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-HIV-1 activity of aqueous dandelion extract.; Methods: The pseudotyped HIV-1 virus has been utilized to explore the anti-HIV-1 activity of dandelion, the level of HIV-1 replication was assessed by the percentage of GFP-positive cells. The inhibitory effect of the dandelion extract on reverse transcriptase activity was assessed by the reverse transcriptase assay kit.; Results: Compared to control values obtained from cells infected without treatment, the level of HIV-1 replication and reverse transcriptase activity were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The data suggest that dandelion extract has a potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 replication and reverse transcriptase activity. The identification of HIV-1 antiviral compounds from Taraxacum officinale should be pursued.; Conclusions: The dandelion extract showed strong activity against HIV-1 RT and inhibited both the HIV-1 vector and the hybrid-MoMuLV/MoMuSV retrovirus replication. These findings provide additional support for the potential therapeutic efficacy of Taraxacum officinale. Extracts from this plant may be regarded as another starting point for the development of an antiretroviral therapy with fewer side effects.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22078030&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nelson, Roger</author><author>Bancel, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of mass consciousness: changes in random data during global events.</title><secondary-title>Explore (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Explore (New York, N.Y.)</full-title><abbr-1>Explore (New York, N.Y.)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>373-383</pages><volume>7</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Consciousness*</keyword><keyword>Emotions</keyword><keyword>Global Health</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mental Processes</keyword><keyword>Random Allocation*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1878-7541</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.explore.2011.08.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A long-term, continuing experiment is designed to assess the possibility that correlations may occur in synchronized random data streams generated during major world events. The project is motivated by numerous experiments that suggest that the behavior of random systems can be altered by directed mental intention, and related experiments showing subtle changes associated with group coherence. Since 1998, the Global Consciousness Project (GCP) has maintained a global network of random number generators (RNGs), recording parallel sequences of random data at 65 sites around the world. A rigorous experiment tests the hypothesis that data from the RNG network will deviate from expectation during times of "global events," defined as transitory episodes of widespread mental and emotional reaction to major world events. An ongoing replication experiment measures correlations across the network during the designated events, and the result from over 345 formal hypothesis tests departs substantially from expectation. A composite statistic for the replication series rejects the null hypothesis by more than six standard deviations. Secondary analyses reveal evidence of a second, independent correlation, as well as temporal and spatial structure in the data associated with the events. Controls exclude conventional physical explanations or experimental error as the source of the measured deviations. The experimental design constrains interpretation of the results: they suggest that some aspect of human consciousness is involved as a source of the effects. (Copyright ÃÂ© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, a multitude of additional Tat functions have been suggested. The importance of these functions is difficult to assess in replication studies with Tat-mutated HIV-1 variants because of the dominant negative effect on viral gene expression. We therefore used an HIV-1 construct that does not depend on the Tat-TAR interaction for transcription to reevaluate whether or not Tat has a second essential function in HIV-1 replication. This HIV-rtTA variant uses the incorporated Tet-On gene expression system for activation of transcription and replicates efficiently upon complete TAR deletion. Here we demonstrated that Tat inactivation does nevertheless severely inhibit replication. Upon long-term culturing, the Tat-minus HIV-rtTA variant acquired mutations in the U3 region that improved promoter activity and reestablished replication. We showed that in the absence of a functional TAR, Tat remains important for viral transcription via Sp1 sequence elements in the U3 promoter region. Substitution of these U3 sequences with nonrelated promoter elements created a virus that replicates efficiently without Tat in SupT1 T cells. These results indicate that Tat has a versatile role in transcription via TAR and U3 elements. The results also imply that Tat has no other essential function in viral replication in cultured T cells.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21752913&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kouloussis, Nikos A</author><author>Papadopoulos, Nikos T</author><author>Katsoyannos, Byron I</author><author>MÃ¼ller, Hans-Georg</author><author>Wang, Jane-Ling</author><author>Su, Yu-Ru</author><author>Molleman, Freerk</author><author>Carey, James R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal trends in Ceratitis capitata reproductive potential derived from live-caught females in Greece.</title><secondary-title>Entomologia experimentalis et applicata</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Entomologia experimentalis et applicata</full-title><abbr-1>Entomologia experimentalis et applicata</abbr-1></periodical><pages>181-188</pages><volume>140</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0013-8703</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1570-7458.2011.01154.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reproductive data of individual insects are extremely hard to collect under natural conditions, thus the study of research questions related to oviposition has not advanced. Patterns of oviposition are often inferred only indirectly, through monitoring of host infestation, whereas the influence of age structure and several other factors on oviposition remains unknown. Using a new approach, in this article, we live-trapped wild Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) females on the Greek island of Chios during two field seasons. For their remaining lifetime, these females were placed individually in small cages and their daily oviposition was monitored. Reproduction rates between cohorts from different collection dates were then compared. The results showed that in the different captive cohorts the average remaining lifetime and reproduction were highly variable within and between seasons. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the month of capture had a significant effect on captive life span, average daily reproduction, and patterns of egg laying. The effect of year was significant on reproduction, but not on captive life span. These differences between sampling periods probably reflect differences in the availability of hosts and other factors that vary during the season and affect age structure and reproduction. Using a non-parametric generalized additive model, we found a statistically significant correlation between the captive life span and the average daily reproduction. These findings and the experimental approach have several important implications.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22791908&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gimeno, Isabel M</author><author>Cortes, Aneg L</author><author>Guy, James S</author><author>Turpin, Elizabeth</author><author>Williams, Christopher</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication of recombinant herpesvirus of turkey expressing genes of infectious laryngotracheitis virus in specific pathogen free and broiler chickens following in ovo and subcutaneous vaccination.</title><secondary-title>Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A</full-title><abbr-1>Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A</abbr-1></periodical><pages>395-403</pages><volume>40</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Viral/blood</keyword><keyword>Chick Embryo</keyword><keyword>Chickens/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Chickens/virology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Herpesviridae Infections/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Herpesviridae Infections/immunology</keyword><keyword>Herpesviridae Infections/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Gallid/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Gallid/genetics</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Gallid/immunology</keyword><keyword>Injections, Subcutaneous/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Organisms, Genetically Modified</keyword><keyword>Poultry Diseases/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Poultry Diseases/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Poultry Diseases/virology</keyword><keyword>Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms</keyword><keyword>Turkeys/virology</keyword><keyword>Vaccination/methods</keyword><keyword>Vaccination/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Vaccines, Synthetic/immunology</keyword><keyword>Viral Load</keyword><keyword>Viral Vaccines/*administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Viral Vaccines/immunology</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/immunology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1465-3338</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/03079457.2011.588196</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replication of a recombinant herpesvirus of turkey vaccine expressing infectious laryngotracheitis virus genes (rHVT-LT) was evaluated in specific pathogen free (SPF) and commercial broiler chickens after various vaccination protocols (amniotic route at embryonation day [ED] 18; intra-embryonic route at ED 19; and subcutaneous at 1 day of age [s.c.]). Three experiments were conducted: in the first experiment, replication of rHVT-LT vaccine was chronologically evaluated and compared with the replication of herpesvirus of turkey (HVT) in SPF chickens; in the second experiment, the effect of different in ovo vaccination procedures on rHVT-LT vaccine replication was evaluated in SPF chickens; and in the third experiment, the effect of different in ovo vaccination procedures on rHVT-LT vaccine replication was evaluated in commercial broiler chickens with maternal antibodies against HVT and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (LTV). rHVT-LT vaccine replicated in chickens after in ovo (ED 18 and ED 19) or s.c. administration at a similar level. In vivo replication of rHVT-LT vaccine was slower than HVT vaccine. However, in vivo both rHVT-LT and HVT vaccines replicated at similar levels. Both vaccines were consistently detected in the spleen and feather pulp and at lower frequency in the lung. The frequency of samples with detectable levels of rHVT-LT DNA was lower in broiler chickens than in SPF chickens, probably due to interactions with maternal antibodies. Differences between SPF chickens and broiler chickens were found also in the transcription of the LTV glycoprotein I gene (gI). In SPF chickens, in ovo inoculation resulted in a higher number of spleen samples with detectable gI transcripts than s.c. inoculation. In broiler chickens, however, no differences in the level of gI transcripts in spleen samples were found between chickens vaccinated in ovo and those vaccinated by the s.c. route. Transcription of LTV gI gene in lung samples was very low in both SPF and broiler chickens. Further studies to evaluate the mucosal immune response elicited by rHVT-LT in chicken with and without maternal antibodies are warranted.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21812719&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kent, Peter</author><author>Briggs, Andrew M</author><author>Albert, Hanne B</author><author>Byrhagen, Andreas</author><author>Hansen, Christian</author><author>Kjaergaard, Karina</author><author>Jensen, Tue S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inexperienced clinicians can extract pathoanatomic information from MRI narrative reports with high reproducibility for use in research/quality assurance.</title><secondary-title>Chiropractic &amp; manual therapies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chiropractic &amp; manual therapies</full-title><abbr-1>Chiropractic &amp; manual therapies</abbr-1></periodical><pages>16</pages><volume>19</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-07-21</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2045-709X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/2045-709X-19-16</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Although reproducibility in reading MRI images amongst radiologists and clinicians has been studied previously, no studies have examined the reproducibility of inexperienced clinicians in extracting pathoanatomic information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) narrative reports and transforming that information into quantitative data. However, this process is frequently required in research and quality assurance contexts. The purpose of this study was to examine inter-rater reproducibility (agreement and reliability) among an inexperienced group of clinicians in extracting spinal pathoanatomic information from radiologist-generated MRI narrative reports.; Methods: Twenty MRI narrative reports were randomly extracted from an institutional database. A group of three physiotherapy students independently reviewed the reports and coded the presence of 14 common pathoanatomic findings using a categorical electronic coding matrix. Decision rules were developed after initial coding in an effort to resolve ambiguities in narrative reports. This process was repeated a further three times using separate samples of 20 MRI reports until no further ambiguities were identified (total n = 80). Reproducibility between trainee clinicians and two highly trained raters was examined in an arbitrary coding round, with agreement measured using percentage agreement and reliability measured using unweighted Kappa (k). Reproducibility was then examined in another group of three trainee clinicians who had not participated in the production of the decision rules, using another sample of 20 MRI reports.; Results: The mean percentage agreement for paired comparisons between the initial trainee clinicians improved over the four coding rounds (97.9-99.4%), although the greatest improvement was observed after the first introduction of coding rules. High inter-rater reproducibility was observed between trainee clinicians across 14 pathoanatomic categories over the four coding rounds (agreement range: 80.8-100%; reliability range k = 0.63-1.00). Concurrent validity was high in paired comparisons between trainee clinicians and highly trained raters (agreement 97.8-98.1%, reliability k = 0.83-0.91). Reproducibility was also high in the second sample of trainee clinicians (inter-rater agreement 96.7-100.0% and reliability k = 0.76-1.00; intra-rater agreement 94.3-100.0% and reliability k = 0.61-1.00).; Conclusions: A high level of radiological training is not required in order to transform MRI-derived pathoanatomic information from a narrative format to a quantitative format with high reproducibility for research or quality assurance purposes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21774836&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, Erin N</author><author>Koller, Daniel L</author><author>Panganiban, Corrie</author><author>Szelinger, Szabolcs</author><author>Zhang, Peng</author><author>Badner, Judith A</author><author>Barrett, Thomas B</author><author>Berrettini, Wade H</author><author>Bloss, Cinnamon S</author><author>Byerley, William</author><author>Coryell, William</author><author>Edenberg, Howard J</author><author>Foroud, Tatiana</author><author>Gershon, Elliot S</author><author>Greenwood, Tiffany A</author><author>Guo, Yiran</author><author>Hipolito, Maria</author><author>Keating, Brendan J</author><author>Lawson, William B</author><author>Liu, Chunyu</author><author>Mahon, Pamela B</author><author>McInnis, Melvin G</author><author>McMahon, Francis J</author><author>McKinney, Rebecca</author><author>Murray, Sarah S</author><author>Nievergelt, Caroline M</author><author>Nurnberger, John I, Jr</author><author>Nwulia, Evaristus A</author><author>Potash, James B</author><author>Rice, John</author><author>Schulze, Thomas G</author><author>Scheftner, William A</author><author>Shilling, Paul D</author><author>Zandi, Peter P</author><author>ZÃ¶llner, Sebastian</author><author>Craig, David W</author><author>Schork, Nicholas J</author><author>Kelsoe, John R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide association of bipolar disorder suggests an enrichment of replicable associations in regions near genes.</title><secondary-title>PLoS genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS genetics</full-title><abbr-1>PLoS genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1002134</pages><volume>7</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Bipolar Disorder/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Computational Biology</keyword><keyword>Exons</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study*</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7404</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1002134</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although a highly heritable and disabling disease, bipolar disorder's (BD) genetic variants have been challenging to identify. We present new genotype data for 1,190 cases and 401 controls and perform a genome-wide association study including additional samples for a total of 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls. We do not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci; however, across all SNPs, we show an association between the power to detect effects calculated from a previous genome-wide association study and evidence for replication (Pâ=â1.5Ã10(-7)). To demonstrate that this result is not likely to be a false positive, we analyze replication rates in a large meta-analysis of height and show that, in a large enough study, associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Within BD, SNPs near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. These results indicate that there is likely common genetic variation associated with BD near exons (Â±10 kb) that could be identified in larger studies and, further, provide a framework for assessing the potential for replication when combining results from multiple studies.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21738484&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lafforgue, Guillaume</author><author>SardanyÃ©s, Josep</author><author>Elena, Santiago F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differences in accumulation and virulence determine the outcome of competition during Tobacco etch virus coinfection.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title><abbr-1>PloS one</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e17917</pages><volume>6</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Plant</keyword><keyword>Genetic Fitness</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological</keyword><keyword>Nicotiana/*virology</keyword><keyword>Nicotiana/genetics</keyword><keyword>Plant Diseases/*virology</keyword><keyword>Plant Diseases/genetics</keyword><keyword>Potyvirus/*pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Potyvirus/genetics</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Virulence/genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-03-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0017917</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Understanding the evolution of virulence for RNA viruses is essential for developing appropriate control strategies. Although it has been usually assumed that virulence is a consequence of within-host replication of the parasite, viral strains may be highly virulent without experiencing large accumulation as a consequence of immunopathological host responses. Using two strains of Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that show a negative relationship between virulence and accumulation rate, we first explored the evolution of virulence and fitness traits during simple and mixed infections. Short-term evolution experiments initiated with each strain independently confirmed the genetic and evolutionary stability of virulence and viral load, although infectivity significantly increased for both strains. Second, competition experiments between hypo- and hypervirulent TEV strains have shown that the outcome of competition is driven by differences in replication rate. A simple mathematical model has been developed to analyze the dynamics of these two strains during coinfection. The model qualitatively reproduced the experimental results using biologically meaningful parameters. Further analyses of the model also revealed a wide parametric region in which a low-fitness but hypovirulent virus can still outcompete a high-fitness but hypervirulent one. These results provide additional support to the observation that virulence and within-host replication may not necessarily be strongly tied in plant RNA viruses.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21423618&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>GonzÃ¡lez-Vioque, Emiliano</author><author>Torres-Torronteras, Javier</author><author>Andreu, Antoni L</author><author>MartÃ­, Ramon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Limited dCTP availability accounts for mitochondrial DNA depletion in mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE).</title><secondary-title>PLoS genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS genetics</full-title><abbr-1>PLoS genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1002035</pages><volume>7</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts/cytology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mitochondria, Liver/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathies/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathies/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Thymine Nucleotides/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Thymine Nucleotides/genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7404</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1002035</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a severe human disease caused by mutations in TYMP, the gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP). It belongs to a broader group of disorders characterized by a pronounced reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in one or more tissues. In most cases, these disorders are caused by mutations in genes involved in deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) metabolism. It is generally accepted that imbalances in mitochondrial dNTP pools resulting from these mutations interfere with mtDNA replication. Nonetheless, the precise mechanistic details of this effect, in particular, how an excess of a given dNTP (e.g., imbalanced dTTP excess observed in TP deficiency) might lead to mtDNA depletion, remain largely unclear. Using an in organello replication experimental model with isolated murine liver mitochondria, we observed that overloads of dATP, dGTP, or dCTP did not reduce the mtDNA replication rate. In contrast, an excess of dTTP decreased mtDNA synthesis, but this effect was due to secondary dCTP depletion rather than to the dTTP excess in itself. This was confirmed in human cultured cells, demonstrating that our conclusions do not depend on the experimental model. Our results demonstrate that the mtDNA replication rate is unaffected by an excess of any of the 4 separate dNTPs and is limited by the availability of the dNTP present at the lowest concentration. Therefore, the availability of dNTP is the key factor that leads to mtDNA depletion rather than dNTP imbalances. These results provide the first test of the mechanism that accounts for mtDNA depletion in MNGIE and provide evidence that limited dNTP availability is the common cause of mtDNA depletion due to impaired anabolic or catabolic dNTP pathways. Thus, therapy approaches focusing on restoring the deficient substrates should be explored.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21483760&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Das, Shubhadeep</author><author>Mindell, Jodi</author><author>Millet, Genevieve C</author><author>Ofer, Dafna</author><author>Beck, Suzanne E</author><author>Mason, Thornton B A</author><author>Brooks, Lee J</author><author>Traylor, Joel</author><author>Marcus, Carole L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pediatric polysomnography: the patient and family perspective.</title><secondary-title>Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>81-87</pages><volume>7</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Child, Preschool</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Interviews as Topic</keyword><keyword>Linear Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods</keyword><keyword>Parent-Child Relations</keyword><keyword>Patient Satisfaction</keyword><keyword>Pediatrics</keyword><keyword>Polysomnography/*methods</keyword><keyword>posttraumatic stress disorder</keyword><keyword>Professional-Family Relations*</keyword><keyword>Sleep Apnea Syndromes/*diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Sleep Apnea Syndromes/psychology</keyword><keyword>Sleep study</keyword><keyword>Statistics, Nonparametric</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-02-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1550-9397</isbn><abstract>Study Objectives: The gold-standard test used to diagnose childhood obstructive sleep apnea is polysomnography. However, this test requires an overnight stay at a sleep laboratory and the attachment of multiple sensors to the patient. The long-term impact of this testing on the child and family are not known. We hypothesized that polysomnography does not precipitate acute or chronic psychological effects in children.; Methods: A consecutive cohort of children who had undergone sleep studies 2 to 4 months prior to the interview were administered a standardized questionnaire via telephone.; Results: Of the 118 families that were eligible to participate, 67% could be contacted and agreed to participate; 87% of respondents reported the experience to have been satisfactory (mean Likert score of 8.6 Â± 2.0 [SD] on a scale of 1-10). Similar levels of satisfaction were reported by parents of children with developmental delay or those who were younger than 3 years. The night's sleep was considered typical in 68% of cases. Sleep was less likely to be typical in children younger than 3 years (47%, p = 0.043). Eight percent of children experienced pain during the study. By caregiver report, of those children who remembered the sleep study, memories were positive in 84%. No child had evidence of serious long-term psychological issues.; Conclusions: The vast majority of children and families found the polysomnography experience to be satisfactory, with no psychological sequelae. However, many children, especially those younger than 3 years, demonstrated sleep patterns different from their usual sleep. The clinical relevance of this finding merits further study. Further research evaluating the generalizability of this study is also needed.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21344042&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Zhou</author><author>Tao, Liming</author><author>Chen, Zhuo</author><author>Zhou, Daizhan</author><author>Kan, Mengyuan</author><author>Zhang, Di</author><author>Li, Can</author><author>He, Lin</author><author>Liu, Yun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association of genetic loci with blood lipids in the Chinese population.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title><abbr-1>PloS one</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e27305</pages><volume>6</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Delta-5 Fatty Acid Desaturase</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lipids/*blood</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0027305</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified a number of novel genetic determinants of blood lipid concentrations in Europeans. However, it is still unclear whether these loci identified in the Caucasian GWA studies also exert the same effect on lipid concentrations in the Chinese population.; Methods and Results: We conducted a replication study assessing associations between SNPs at 15 loci and blood lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in two Chinese cohorts, comprising 2533 and 2105 individuals respectively. SNPs in APO(A1/C3/A4/A5), TIMD4-HAVCR1, DOCK7, TRIB1, ABCA1, and TOMM40-APOE showed strong associations with at least one lipids trait, and rs174546 in FADS1/2/3 showed modest association with triglyceride in the Chinese population.; Conclusions: We successfully replicated 7 loci associated plasma lipid concentrations in the Chinese population.

To date, the impact of escape on viral load and CD4(+) T cell count has not been quantified, primarily because of sparse longitudinal data and the difficulty of separating cause and effect in cross-sectional studies. We use two independent methods to quantify the impact of HIV-1 escape from CTLs in chronic infection: mathematical modelling of escape and statistical analysis of a cross-sectional cohort. Mathematical modelling revealed a modest increase in log viral load of 0.051 copies ml(-1) per escape event. Analysis of the cross-sectional cohort revealed a significant positive association between viral load and the number of "escape events", after correcting for length of infection and rate of replication. We estimate that a single CTL escape event leads to a viral load increase of 0.11 log copies ml(-1) (95% confidence interval: 0.040-0.18), consistent with the predictions from the mathematical modelling. Overall, the number of escape events could only account for approximately 6% of the viral load variation in the cohort. Our findings indicate that although the loss of the CTL response for a single epitope results in a highly statistically significant increase in viral load, the biological impact is modest. We suggest that this small increase in viral load is explained by the small growth advantage of the variant relative to the wildtype virus. Escape from CTLs had a measurable, but unexpectedly low, impact on viral load in chronic infection.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21079675&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Killinger, Karen M</author><author>Kannan, Aditi</author><author>Bary, Andy I</author><author>Cogger, Craig G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validation of a 2 percent lactic acid antimicrobial rinse for mobile poultry slaughter operations.</title><secondary-title>Journal of food protection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of food protection</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of food protection</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2079-2083</pages><volume>73</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Abattoirs/*standards</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Chickens/microbiology</keyword><keyword>Chlorine/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Colony Count, Microbial</keyword><keyword>Consumer Product Safety</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</keyword><keyword>Food Contamination/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lactic Acid/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Salmonella/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Salmonella/growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Sanitation/methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0362-028X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4315/0362-028x-73.11.2079</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Poultry processing antimicrobial interventions are critical for pathogen control, and organic, mobile operations in Washington seek alternatives to chlorine. Laboratory and field studies (three replications each) evaluated lactic acid efficacy as a chlorine alternative. For the laboratory study, retail-purchased, conventionally processed chicken wings inoculated with Salmonella were randomly assigned to the following treatments: Salmonella inoculation followed by no treatment (10 wings) or by 3-min rinses of water, 50 to 100 ppm of chlorine, or 2% lactic acid (20 wings for each rinse treatment). Wings were sampled for Salmonella enumeration on xylose lysine desoxycholate agar. During pastured poultry processing at mobile slaughter units for each field study replication, 20 chicken carcasses were randomly assigned to each treatment: untreated control or 3-min immersion in lactic acid or chlorine. Whole-carcass rinses were examined for aerobic plate count (APC) on tryptic soy agar and coliforms on violet red bile agar. Untreated controls were also examined for Salmonella. In the laboratory study, lactic acid produced a significant (P &lt; 0.01) Salmonella reduction compared with the inoculated no-rinse, water, and chlorine treatments, which were statistically similar to each other. In the field study, no Salmonella was detected on untreated controls. Lactic acid produced significant &gt;2-log (P &lt; 0.01) reductions in APC and coliforms, whereas chlorine resulted in slight, but significant 0.4-log reductions (P &lt; 0.01) and 0.21-log reductions (P &lt; 0.05) in APC and coliforms compared with untreated controls. Considering laboratory and field studies, lactic acid produced greater reductions in Salmonella, APC, and coliforms, validating its effectiveness as a chlorine alternative in mobile poultry slaughter operations.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21219721&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gilbert, David M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating genome-scale approaches to eukaryotic DNA replication.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

Recently, genome-scale methods have been brought to bear on this problem. The identification of replication origins and their associated proteins in yeasts is a well-integrated investigative tool, but corresponding data sets from multicellular organisms are scarce. By contrast, standardized protocols for evaluating replication timing have generated informative data sets for most eukaryotic systems. Here, I summarize the genome-scale methods that are most frequently used to analyse replication in eukaryotes, the kinds of questions each method can address and the technical hurdles that must be overcome to gain a complete understanding of the nature of eukaryotic replication origins.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20811343&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kolesnikova, T D</author><author>Demakov, S A</author><author>Ivankin, A V</author><author>Zhimulev, I F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Molecular combing in studies of the genome organization and DNA replication].</title><secondary-title>Genetika</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genetika</full-title><abbr-1>Genetika</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1409-1412</pages><volume>46</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication/*physiology</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Drosophila melanogaster</keyword><keyword>Drosophila Proteins/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Drosophila Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Genome, Insect/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0016-6758</isbn><abstract>Molecular combing (MC) yields preparations where individual DNA molecules are uniformly stretched and are parallel to each other.

We identify six advantages that long-term, individual based studies afford in ecology and evolution: (i) analysis of age structure; (ii) linkage between life history stages; (iii) quantification of social structure; (iv) derivation of lifetime fitness measures; (v) replication of estimates of selection; (vi) linkage between generations, and we review their impact on studies in six key areas of evolution and ecology. Our review emphasises the unusual opportunities and productivity of long-term, individual-based studies and documents the important role that they play in research on ecology and evolutionary biology as well as the difficulties they face.

Here, we compiled extensive archival records to quantify the pandemic mortality patterns in 2 Mexican cities, Mexico City and Toluca.; Methods: We applied seasonal excess mortality models to age-specific respiratory mortality rates for 1915-1920 and quantified the reproduction number from daily data.; Results: We identified 3 pandemic waves in Mexico City in spring 1918, autumn 1918, and winter 1920, which were characterized by unusual excess mortality among people 25-44 years old. Toluca experienced 2-fold higher excess mortality rates than Mexico City but did not experience a substantial third wave. All age groups, including that of people 65 years old, experienced excess mortality during 1918-1920. Reproduction number estimates were &lt;2.5, assuming a 3-d generation interval.; Conclusion: Mexico experienced a herald pandemic wave with elevated young adult mortality in spring 1918, similar to the United States and Europe. In contrast to the United States and Europe, there was no mortality sparing among Mexican seniors 65 years old, highlighting potential geographical differences in preexisting immunity to the 1918 virus. We discuss the relevance of our findings to the 2009 pandemic mortality patterns.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20594109&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Yinshi</author><author>Wang, Jianhua</author><author>Gu, Shubo</author><author>Liu, Zhengbo</author><author>Zhang, Yujie</author><author>Zhang, Xiaoxia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simultaneous determination of flavonoids in different parts of Citrus reticulata 'Chachi' fruit by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection.</title><secondary-title>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</full-title><abbr-1>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5378-5388</pages><volume>15</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Calibration</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods</keyword><keyword>Citrus/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Flavonoids/*analysis</keyword><keyword>Flavonoids/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Linear Models</keyword><keyword>Reference Standards</keyword><keyword>Solvents/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-08-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1420-3049</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/molecules15085378</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Flavonoids are important polyphenolic secondary metabolites in plant. Citrus reticulata 'Chachi' fruit are rich in flavonoids and are being used as functional antioxidant ingredients for the treatment of atherosclerosis and cancer, etc. A high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection system was used to analyze five flavonoids, namely, naringin, hesperidin, didymin, tangeretin and nobiletin, in different parts of C. reticulata 'Chachi' fruit. The chromatographic analysis was performed on a C(18) column with a gradient elution of acetonitrile and water at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Detection was carried out using a photodiode array detector at 280 nm. The calibration curves for the determination of all analytes showed good linearity over the investigated ranges (R2 &gt; 0.9995). Precision and reproducibility were evaluated by six replicated analyses, and the R.S.D. values were less than 0.9% and 2.7%. The recoveries were between 98.37 and 103.89%.

However, the reproducibility of this technique remains incompletely evaluated, particularly in patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this study was to determine the inter-study reproducibility of adenosine stress CMR in patients with symptomatic multi-vessel CAD and those at low risk for CAD.; Methods: Twenty patients (10 with CAD, 10 low risk CAD) underwent two CMR scans 8 +/- 2 days apart. Basal, mid and apical left ventricular short axis slices were acquired using gadolinium 0.05 mmol/kg at peak stress (adenosine, 140 micro/kg/min, 4 min) and rest. Myocardial perfusion was evaluated qualitatively by assessing the number of ischemic segments, and semi-quantitatively by determining the myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRi) using a normalized upslope method. Inter-study and observer reproducibility were assessed--the latter being defined by the coefficient of variation (CoV), which was calculated from the standard deviation of the differences of the measurements, divided by the mean. Additionally, the percentage of myocardial segments with perfect agreement and inter- and intra-observer MPRi correlation between studies, were also determined.; Results: The CoV for the number of ischemic segments was 31% with a mean difference of -0.15 +/- 0.88 segments and 91% perfect agreement between studies. MPRi was lower in patients with CAD (1.13 +/- 0.21) compared to those with low risk CAD (1.59 +/- 0.58), p = 0.02. The reproducibility of MPRi was 19% with no significant difference between patients with CAD and those with low risk CAD (p = 0.850). Observer reproducibility for MPRi was high: inter-observer CoV 9%, r = 0.93 and intra-observer CoV 5%, r = 0.94. For trials using perfusion CMR as an endpoint, an estimated sample size of 12 subjects would be required to detect a two-segment change in the number of ischemic segments (power 0.9, alpha 0.05).; Conclusions: Adenosine stress CMR, by qualitative and semi-quantitative normalized upslope analyses are reproducible techniques in both patients with multi-vessel CAD and those without known CAD. The robust inter-study reproducibility of perfusion CMR supports its clinical and research application.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20663155&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Kuyl, Antoinette C</author><author>Kozaczynska, Karolina</author><author>AriÃ«n, Kevin K</author><author>Gali, Youssef</author><author>BalÃ¡zs, Victoria R</author><author>Dekker, Stefan J</author><author>Zorgdrager, Fokla</author><author>Vanham, Guido</author><author>Berkhout, Ben</author><author>Cornelissen, Marion</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of infectious virus clones from two HIV-1 superinfection cases suggests that the primary strains have lower fitness.</title><secondary-title>Retrovirology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Retrovirology</full-title><abbr-1>Retrovirology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>60</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>DNA Mutational Analysis</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections/*virology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis, Insertional</keyword><keyword>Mutation, Missense</keyword><keyword>Plasma/virology</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>Superinfection/*virology</keyword><keyword>Viral Load</keyword><keyword>Virulence</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-07-20</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1742-4690</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1742-4690-7-60</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Two HIV-1 positive patients, L and P, participating in the Amsterdam Cohort studies acquired an HIV-1 superinfection within half a year from their primary HIV-1 infection (Jurriaans et al., JAIDS 2008, 47:69-73). The aim of this study was to compare the replicative fitness of the primary and superinfecting HIV-1 strains of both patients. The use of isolate-specific primer sets indicated that the primary and secondary strains co-exist in plasma at all time points after the moment of superinfection.; Results: Biological HIV-1 clones were derived from peripheral blood CD4 + T cells at different time point, and identified as the primary or secondary virus through sequence analysis. Replication competition assays were performed with selected virus pairs in PHA/IL-2 activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) and analyzed with the Heteroduplex Tracking Assay (HTA) and isolate-specific PCR amplification. In both cases, we found a replicative advantage of the secondary HIV-1 strain over the primary virus. Full-length HIV-1 genomes were sequenced to find possible explanations for the difference in replication capacity. Mutations that could negatively affect viral replication were identified in the primary infecting strains. In patient L, the primary strain has two insertions in the LTR promoter, combined with a mutation in the tat gene that has been associated with decreased replication capacity. The primary HIV-1 strain isolated from patient P has two mutations in the LTR that have been associated with a reduced replication rate. In a luciferase assay, only the LTR from the primary virus of patient P had lower transcriptional activity compared with the superinfecting virus.; Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest the interesting scenario that superinfection occurs preferentially in patients infected with a relatively attenuated HIV-1 isolate.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20646276&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Lei</author><author>Liu, Longding</author><author>Che, Yanchun</author><author>Wang, Lichun</author><author>Jiang, Li</author><author>Dong, Chenghong</author><author>Zhang, Ying</author><author>Li, Qihan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Egress of HSV-1 capsid requires the interaction of VP26 and a cellular tetraspanin membrane protein.</title><secondary-title>Virology journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virology journal</full-title><abbr-1>Virology journal</abbr-1></periodical><pages>156</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Capsid Proteins/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capsid Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cricetinae</keyword><keyword>Herpes Simplex/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Herpes Simplex/genetics</keyword><keyword>Herpes Simplex/virology</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Human/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Tetraspanins</keyword><keyword>Virus Release*</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-07-14</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1743-422X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1743-422X-7-156</electronic-resource-num><abstract>HSV-1 viral capsid maturation and egress from the nucleus constitutes a self-controlled process of interactions between host cytoplasmic membrane proteins and viral capsid proteins. In this study, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, CTMP-7, was shown to physically interact with HSV-1 protein VP26, and the VP26-CTMP-7 complex was detected both in vivo and in vitro. The interaction of VP26 with CTMP-7 plays an essential role in normal HSV-1 replication. Additionally, analysis of a recombinant virus HSV-1-UG showed that mutating VP26 resulted in a decreased viral replication rate and in aggregation of viral mutant capsids in the nucleus. Together, our data support the notion that biological events mediated by a VP26 - CTMP-7 interaction aid in viral capsid enveloping and egress from the cell during the HSV-1 infectious process.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20630051&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Orosz, LÃ¡szlÃ³</author><author>Gallyas, Eva</author><author>KemÃ©ny, Lajos</author><author>MÃ¡ndi, Yvette</author><author>FacskÃ³, Andrea</author><author>Megyeri, KlÃ¡ra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Involvement of p63 in the herpes simplex virus-1-induced demise of corneal cells.</title><secondary-title>Journal of biomedical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of biomedical science</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of biomedical science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>47</pages><volume>17</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Human/*pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Human/physiology</keyword><keyword>Keratitis, Herpetic/*etiology</keyword><keyword>Keratitis, Herpetic/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Keratitis, Herpetic/pathology</keyword><keyword>Keratitis, Herpetic/virology</keyword><keyword>Rabbits</keyword><keyword>Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-06-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1423-0127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1423-0127-17-47</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The transcription factor p63 plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues, including the ocular surface. In an effort to gain insight into the pathogenesis of keratitis caused by HSV-1, we determined the expression patterns of the p63 and Bax proteins in the Staatens Seruminstitute Rabbit Cornea cell line (SIRC).; Methods: SIRC cells were infected with HSV-1 at various multiplicities and maintained for different periods of time. Virus replication was measured by indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. The apoptotic response of the infected cells was quantified by ELISA detecting the enrichment of nucleosomes in the cytoplasm. Western blot analysis was used to determine the levels of p63 and Bax proteins.; Results: Indirect immunofluorescence assays and Western blot analyses demonstrated the presence of HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) in the infected SIRC cell line, and the pattern of gD expression was consistent with efficient viral replication. The results of MTT and ELISA assays showed that HSV-1 elicited a strong cytopathic effect, and apoptosis played an important role in the demise of the infected cells. Mock-infected SIRC cells displayed the constitutive expression of DeltaNp63alpha. The expressions of the Bax-beta and TAp63gamma isoforms were considerably increased, whereas the level of DeltaNp63alpha was decreased in the HSV-1-infected SIRC cells. Experiments involving the use of acyclovir showed that viral DNA replication was necessary for the accumulation of TAp63gamma.; Conclusion: These data suggest that a direct, virus-mediated cytopathic effect may play an important role in the pathogenic mechanism of herpetic keratitis. By disturbing the delicate balance between the pro-survival DeltaN and the pro-apoptotic TA isoforms, HSV-1 may cause profound alterations in the viability of the ocular cells and in the tissue homeostasis of the ocular surface.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20529292&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Diaconu, Iulia</author><author>Cerullo, Vincenzo</author><author>Escutenaire, Sophie</author><author>Kanerva, Anna</author><author>Bauerschmitz, Gerd J</author><author>Hernandez-Alcoceba, Ruben</author><author>Pesonen, Sari</author><author>Hemminki, Akseli</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human adenovirus replication in immunocompetent Syrian hamsters can be attenuated with chlorpromazine or cidofovir.</title><secondary-title>The journal of gene medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The journal of gene medicine</full-title><abbr-1>The journal of gene medicine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>435-445</pages><volume>12</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenoviridae Infections/virology</keyword><keyword>Adenoviruses, Human/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Adenoviruses, Human/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological Transport/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Death/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Line, Tumor</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus/virology</keyword><keyword>Chlorpromazine/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cidofovir</keyword><keyword>Cricetinae</keyword><keyword>Cytarabine/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cytosine/*analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Cytosine/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunocompetence/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Immunocompetence/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Mesocricetus/*virology</keyword><keyword>Mesocricetus/immunology</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms/pathology</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms/virology</keyword><keyword>Organ Specificity/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Organophosphonates/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Transduction, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/*drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1521-2254</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jgm.1453</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Adenoviruses can cause severe toxicity in children and in immunocompromised adults, and therefore a means to abrogate replication would be useful. With regard to cancer treatment, replication competent oncolytic adenoviruses have been safe in humans, although their efficacy has been variable. Therefore, more effective agents are now entering clinical testing and, consequently, replication-associated side effects remain a concern. Preclinical analysis of replication related toxicity has been hampered by a lack of permissive models. Therefore, it has been difficult to study modulation of human adenovirus replication in immune competent animals.; Methods: We investigated four different hamster carcinoma cell lines for transduction and cell killing potency in vitro and in vivo. Gene transfer was assessed using replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing luciferase. Cell killing was studied in vitro and in vivo using an oncolytic adenovirus that kills tumor cells by viral replication. After the most promising animal model had been selected, abrogation of virus replication was assessed in vitro and in vivo using a TCID(50) assay.; Results: The results obtained suggest wild-type adenovirus replication in all four tested Syrian hamster cell lines and also normal organs. Virus replication could be abrogated with chlorpromazine, cidofovir and cytosine arabinoside, and the effect occurred subsequent to nuclear delivery of the viral genome. Attenuation of virus replication also was seen in vivo both in tumors and the liver.; Conclusions: Syrian hamsters may comprise a valuable immune competent model for evaluating anti-adenoviral drugs. Furthermore, chlorpromazine or cidofovir might be useful in case of adenovirus replication-associated symptoms in humans.

Whole Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or CD8(+) cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from previously tetanus toxoid (TT)-immunized individuals were activated with TT plus IL-2, and cell proliferation, cytokine production, and in vitro HIV-1 replication were measured. The in vivo magnitude of the humoral immune response was also assessed by antibody measurements. Our results showed that, compared with other groups, both in vitro TT-specific lymphoproliferation and serum antibody concentration were lower in older AIDS patients. Although the IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production were higher in cultures from aged HIV-1-infected patients, a dramatic damage on the interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) release was observed, when compared with younger patients. CD8(+) T lymphocytes depletion reduced IL-1beta and TNF-alpha release in the older groups, however, it did not significantly alter their IFN-gamma production. Furthermore, the neutralization of endogenous IL-10 did not change the IFN-gamma deficiency in older AIDS patients. Finally, the lower cellular immune response in this patient group was not related to in vitro HIV-1 replication. The results suggest that successfully highly active antiretroviral therapy-treated aged AIDS patients do not reconstitute the immune response to TT, making them probably more susceptible to tetanus even after vaccination.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20224419&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Zhan</author><author>Liu, Feng-Jun</author><author>Liu, Li</author><author>Zhou, Tao-You</author><author>Lei, Jun</author><author>Xu, Lu</author><author>Liu, Cong</author><author>Dai, Jie</author><author>Chen, En-Qiang</author><author>Tang, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of hepatitis B virus replication mouse model.</title><secondary-title>World journal of gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>World journal of gastroenterology</full-title><abbr-1>World journal of gastroenterology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1979-1985</pages><volume>16</volume><number>16</number><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antiviral Agents/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance, Viral</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis B virus/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis B/*virology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Liver/pathology</keyword><keyword>Liver/virology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, Inbred BALB C</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Nucleosides/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Pyrimidinones/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Telbivudine</keyword><keyword>Thymidine/analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-04-28</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2219-2840</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3748/wjg.v16.i16.1979</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aim: To evaluate the value of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication mouse model with regard to several aspects of the study of HBV biology.; Methods: To evaluate the HBV replication mouse model in detecting the efficacy of anti-HBV agents, the interferon inducer polyinosinic-polytidylin acid (polyIC) and nucleotide analogues adefovir and entecavir were administered to mice injected with wild type pHBV4.1, and the inhibiting effect of these agents on HBV DNA replication was evaluated. To identify the model's value in a replication ability study of HBV drug-resistant mutants and a HBx-minus mutant, telbivudine resistance mutants (rtM204I, ayw subtype), adefovir resistance mutants (rtA181V + rtN236T, ayw subtype) and HBx-minus mutants were injected respectively, and their corresponding HBV DNA replication intermediates in mouse liver were assessed.; Results: Compared with the wild type HBV replication mouse model without antiviral agent treatment, the HBV DNA replication intermediates of the polyIC-treated group were decreased 1-fold; while in the entecavir- and adefovir-treated groups, the levels of HBV DNA replication intermediates were inhibited 13.6-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively. For the mouse models injected with telbivudine resistance mutant, adefovir resistance mutant and HBx-minus mutant, HBV DNA replication intermediates could still be detected, but the levels of HBV DNA replication intermediates of these mutants decreased 4.5-fold, 5.6-fold and 2.9-fold respectively, compared with the mouse model with wild type HBV plasmid.; Conclusion: The HBV replication mouse model we established was a useful and convenient tool to detect the efficacy of antiviral agents and to study the replication ability of HBV mutants in vivo.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20419834&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bae, Yun-Jung</author><author>Choi, Hae-Yeon</author><author>Sung, Mi-Kyung</author><author>Kim, Mi-Kyung</author><author>Choi, Mi-Kyeong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validity and reproducibility of a food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary nutrients for prevention and management of metabolic syndrome in Korea.</title><secondary-title>Nutrition research and practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nutrition research and practice</full-title><abbr-1>Nutrition research and practice</abbr-1></periodical><pages>121-127</pages><volume>4</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>food frequency questionnaire</keyword><keyword>Korean adults</keyword><keyword>Metabolic syndrome</keyword><keyword>reproducibility</keyword><keyword>validity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2005-6168</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4162/nrp.2010.4.2.121</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Little data exists on metabolic syndrome (MetS) related with intake, especially for the South Korean. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for nutritional assessment in the population with MetS in South Korea. Randomly selected female participants, mean age 21.9 years (n = 38) were invited to answer the FFQ twice (FFQ1 and FFQ2) over a nine-month interval and to complete twelve-day diet records (DR) during the months between in South Korea. The correlation coefficients for nutrient intake between FFQ1 and FFQ2 varied from 0.253 (niacin) to 0.573 (cholesterol), and the energy intake-adjusted correlation coefficients ranged from 0.187 for protein to 0.662 for iron. The energy intake-adjusted and de-attenuated correlation coefficients for comparison of FFQ1 and the DRs ranged between 0.277 (vitamin B1) and 0.768 (fiber), and between 0.229 (zinc) and 0.859 (fat) for comparison of DRs with FFQ2. The percentages of study subjects classified into the same quartiles in both the DRs and FFQ1 ranged from 15.8% (vitamin B(6)) to 47.4% (calcium), and for the same quartiles in DRs and FFQ2 from 13.2% (vitamin B(1)) to 44.7% (potassium). The FFQ has reasonably good validity and reproducibility.

A fully automated system with integration of a reversed phase-strong cation exchange (RP-SCX) biphasic trap column into vented sample injection system was developed to realize online sample loading, isotope dimethyl labeling and online multidimensional separation of the proteome samples. Comparing to conventionally manual isotope labeling and off-line fractionation technologies, this system is fully automated and time-saving, which is benefit for improving the quantification reproducibility and accuracy. As phosphate SCX monolith was integrated into the biphasic trap column, high sample injection flow rate and high-resolution stepwise fractionation could be easily achieved. Approximately 1000 proteins could be quantified in approximately 30 h proteome analysis, and the proteome coverage of quantitative analysis can be further greatly improved by prolong the multidimensional separation time. This system was applied to analyze the different protein expression level of HCC and normal human liver tissues. After three times replicated analysis, finally 94 up-regulated and 249 down-regulated (HCC/Normal) proteins were successfully obtained. These significantly regulated proteins are widely validated by both gene and proteins expression studies previously. Such as some enzymes involved in urea cycle, methylation cycle and fatty acids catabolism in liver were all observed down-regulated.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20230046&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gretton, Sarah</author><author>Hughes, Mair</author><author>Harris, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hepatitis C virus RNA replication is regulated by Ras-Erk signalling.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of general virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of general virology</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of general virology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>671-680</pages><volume>91</volume><number>Pt 3</number><issue>Pt 3</issue><keywords><keyword>Benzamides/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Butadienes/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Flavonoids/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Hepacivirus/*physiology</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Nitriles/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>ras GTPase-Activating Proteins/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction*</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1465-2099</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1099/vir.0.016899-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The hepatitis C virus NS5A protein has been previously demonstrated to partially attenuate activation of the Ras-Erk signalling pathway, via a conserved class II polyproline motif located towards the C terminus of the protein. However, the role of Ras-Erk signalling in the virus life cycle remains undetermined. To investigate this, levels of RNA replication were measured in genotypes 1 and 2 transient luciferase subgenomic replicon systems in the context of either pharmacological or genetic (dominant-negative) inhibition of MEK1, a kinase in the Ras-Erk signalling cascade. Incubation in the presence of two inhibitors (U0126 and PD184352) resulted in a decrease in the levels of RNA replication, conversely incubation with inhibitor PD98059 resulted in a modest increase in replication. The results obtained with PD98059 could not be explained by an off-target effect on Cox-2, stability of replicon RNA or stimulation of global translation levels, suggesting stimulation by a yet uncharacterized mechanism. To verify data obtained using pharmacological inhibitors the transient replicon RNA was co-electroporated with a dominant-negative mutant of MEK1. This resulted in a reduction in replication, confirming data seen with U0126 and PD184352. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that a low level Ras-Erk signalling activity is required for RNA replication. However, complete inhibition of Ras-Erk signalling is inhibitory. These results suggest that perturbation of this signalling pathway by NS5A may be a mechanism to regulate levels of genomic RNA replication.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19889932&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bunnik, Evelien M</author><author>Lobbrecht, Marilie S D</author><author>van Nuenen, Ad C</author><author>Schuitemaker, Hanneke</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Escape from autologous humoral immunity of HIV-1 is not associated with a decrease in replicative capacity.</title><secondary-title>Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virology</full-title><abbr-1>Virology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>224-230</pages><volume>397</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptation, Biological*</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology</keyword><keyword>CD4 Lymphocyte Count</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>DNA Mutational Analysis</keyword><keyword>Glycosylation</keyword><keyword>HIV Antibodies/*immunology</keyword><keyword>HIV Envelope Protein gp120/genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV Envelope Protein gp120/immunology</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections/*immunology</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections/*virology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*immunology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*physiology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Selection, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-02-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1096-0341</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.virol.2009.11.009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Autologous HIV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) seem unable to inhibit viral replication as they rapidly select for neutralization escape variants. However, NAbs could potentially contribute indirectly to the control of HIV-1 if changes in the viral envelope coinciding with NAb escape would impair viral replication fitness. Here we analyzed the replication kinetics of HIV-1 isolated over the course of infection from five typical progressors, three of whom developed strong autologous neutralizing humoral immunity. Viral replication rate did not correlate with viral sensitivity to autologous serum neutralization or with envelope length or number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120, suggesting that the flexibility of the viral envelope allows escape from NAbs without the loss of viral fitness. Interestingly, the appearance of rapidly replicating viruses late in infection correlated with lower CD4(+) T-cell counts, suggesting that this viral characteristic may be positively selected when the availability of target cells becomes limiting.

Here, we describe newly developed methods to study the coordination of DNA unwinding, priming, and synthesis at the DNA-replication fork. The length of individual DNA molecules is used to measure the activity of single replisomes engaged in coordinated DNA replication. First, a tethered-particle technique is used to visualize the formation and release of replication loops. Second, a fluorescence imaging method provides a direct readout of replication rates and processivities from individual replisomes. The ability to directly observe transient reaction intermediates and characterize heterogeneous behavior makes these single-molecule approaches important new additions to the tools available to study DNA replication.

The purpose of this study was to assess reliability and construct validity of measures of condom attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy across 3,989 youth. Data were collected at computer kiosks and on the Internet. Analyses included internal consistency reliability assessments and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of three constructs in a 32-item a priori instrument. Reliability estimates ranged between 0.68 and 0.89, and goodness of fit indices all exceeded 0.90. Factor analysis results supported the compatibility of the items from the three subscales with their conceptual domains. Final scales include measures of positive and negative outcome expectancies related to condom use, peer and partner condom norms, self-efficacy for condom negotiation, and self-efficacy for condom use. These measures of condom attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy can be employed for assessments to improve standardization of measures and generalizability of research, particularly related to HIV prevention.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21290923&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buness, Andreas</author><author>Ruschhaupt, Markus</author><author>Kuner, Ruprecht</author><author>Tresch, Achim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Classification across gene expression microarray studies.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title><abbr-1>BMC bioinformatics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>453</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Breast Neoplasms/genetics</keyword><keyword>Computational Biology</keyword><keyword>Databases, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling/methods</keyword><keyword>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-12-30</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2105</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-10-453</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The increasing number of gene expression microarray studies represents an important resource in biomedical research. As a result, gene expression based diagnosis has entered clinical practice for patient stratification in breast cancer. However, the integration and combined analysis of microarray studies remains still a challenge. We assessed the potential benefit of data integration on the classification accuracy and systematically evaluated the generalization performance of selected methods on four breast cancer studies comprising almost 1000 independent samples. To this end, we introduced an evaluation framework which aims to establish good statistical practice and a graphical way to monitor differences. The classification goal was to correctly predict estrogen receptor status (negative/positive) and histological grade (low/high) of each tumor sample in an independent study which was not used for the training. For the classification we chose support vector machines (SVM), predictive analysis of microarrays (PAM), random forest (RF) and k-top scoring pairs (kTSP). Guided by considerations relevant for classification across studies we developed a generalization of kTSP which we evaluated in addition. Our derived version (DV) aims to improve the robustness of the intrinsic invariance of kTSP with respect to technologies and preprocessing.; Results: For each individual study the generalization error was benchmarked via complete cross-validation and was found to be similar for all classification methods. The misclassification rates were substantially higher in classification across studies, when each single study was used as an independent test set while all remaining studies were combined for the training of the classifier. However, with increasing number of independent microarray studies used in the training, the overall classification performance improved. DV performed better than the average and showed slightly less variance. In particular, the better predictive results of DV in across platform classification indicate higher robustness of the classifier when trained on single channel data and applied to gene expression ratios.; Conclusions: We present a systematic evaluation of strategies for the integration of independent microarray studies in a classification task. Our findings in across studies classification may guide further research aiming on the construction of more robust and reliable methods for stratification and diagnosis in clinical practice.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20042109&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tanaka, Hirokazu</author><author>Sejnowski, Terrence J</author><author>Krakauer, John W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adaptation to visuomotor rotation through interaction between posterior parietal and motor cortical areas.</title><secondary-title>Journal of neurophysiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of neurophysiology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of neurophysiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2921-2932</pages><volume>102</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptation, Physiological/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Generalization, Psychological</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Models, Neurological</keyword><keyword>Motor Cortex/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Movement/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Parietal Lobe/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Photic Stimulation</keyword><keyword>Psychomotor Performance/physiology</keyword><keyword>Reaction Time/physiology</keyword><keyword>Rotation*</keyword><keyword>Visual Pathways/physiology</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1522-1598</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/jn.90834.2008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Studying how motor adaptation to visuomotor rotation for one reach direction generalizes to other reach directions can provide insight into how visuomotor maps are represented and learned in the brain. Previous psychophysical studies have concluded that postadaptation generalization is restricted to a narrow range of directions around the training direction. A population-coding model that updates the weights between narrow Gaussian-tuned visual units and motor units on each trial reproduced experimental trial-by-trial learning curves for rotation adaptation and the generalization function measured postadaptation. These results suggest that the neurons involved in rotation adaptation have a relatively narrow directional tuning width ( approximately 23 degrees ). Population coding models with units having broader tuning functions (such as cosine tuning in motor cortex and Gaussian sum in the cerebellum) could not reproduce the narrow single-peaked generalization pattern. Visually selective neurons with narrow Gaussian tuning curves have been identified in posterior parietal cortex, making it a possible site of adaptation to visuomotor rotation. We propose that rotation adaptation proceeds through changes in synaptic weights between neurons in posterior parietal cortex and motor cortex driven by a prediction error computed by the cerebellum.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19741098&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McBryde, Es</author><author>Bergeri, I</author><author>van Gemert, C</author><author>Rotty, J</author><author>Headley, Ej</author><author>Simpson, K</author><author>Lester, Ra</author><author>Hellard, M</author><author>Fielding, Je</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early transmission characteristics of influenza A(H1N1)v in Australia: Victorian state, 16 May - 3 June 2009.</title><secondary-title>Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin</full-title><abbr-1>Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin</abbr-1></periodical><volume>14</volume><number>42</number><issue>42</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype*</keyword><keyword>Influenza, Human/*transmission</keyword><keyword>Mathematics</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Victoria</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-10-22</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1560-7917</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/ese.14.42.19363-en</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Australia was one of the first countries of the southern hemisphere to experience influenza A(H1N1)v with community transmission apparent in Victoria, Australia, by 22 May 2009. With few identified imported cases, the epidemic spread through schools and communities leading to 897 confirmed cases by 3 June 2009. The estimated reproduction ratio up to 31 May 2009 was 2.4 (95% credible interval (CI): 2.1-2.6). Methods designed to account for undetected transmission reduce this estimate to 1.6 (95% CI: 1.5-1.8). Time varying reproduction ratio estimates show a steady decline in observed transmission over the first 14 days of the epidemic. This could be accounted for by ascertainment bias or a true impact of interventions including antiviral prophylaxis, treatment and school closure. Most cases (78%) in the first 19 days in Victoria were under the age of 20 years-old. Estimates suggest that the average youth primary case infected at least two other youths in the early growth phase, which was sufficient to drive the epidemic.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19883544&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tanner, Nathan A</author><author>Loparo, Joseph J</author><author>van Oijen, Antoine M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Visualizing Single-molecule DNA Replication with Fluorescence Microscopy.</title><secondary-title>Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE</abbr-1></periodical><number>32</number><issue>32</issue><keywords><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>DNA/*biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>DNA/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods</keyword><keyword>Templates, Genetic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-10-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1940-087X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3791/1529</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We describe a simple fluorescence microscopy-based real-time method for observing DNA replication at the single-molecule level.

One independent reproduction trial however, yielded an effect inversion: wheat shoot growth was significantly decreased after application of Ars-alb 45x.; Aims: In this study we investigated the role of three potential confounding factors on the experimental outcome: geographical location of the experiments, influence of the main experimenter, and seed sensitivity to Arsenic poisoning. Laboratory-internal reproducibility was assessed by meta-analysis.; Material and Methods: Wheat poisoned with Arsenic trioxide was cultivated in vitro in either Ars-alb 45x, water 45x, or unpotentised water. Treatments were blinded and randomised. Shoot length was measured after 7 days. The stability of the experimental set-up was assessed by systematic negative control (SNC) experiments.; Results: The SNC experiments did not yield significant differences between the three groups treated with unpotentised water. Thus the experimental set-up seemed to be stable. We did not observe any shoot growth increase after a treatment with Ars-alb 45x in any of the newly performed experiments. In contrast, the meta-analysis of all 17 experiments performed (including earlier experiments already published) yielded a statistically significant shoot growth decrease (-3.2%, p=0.017) with isopathic Ars-alb 45x treatment. This effect was quantitatively similar across all five series of experiments.; Conclusions: Ultramolecular Ars-alb 45x led to statistically significant specific effects in arsenic poisoned wheat when investigated by two independent working groups. Effect size and effect direction differ, however. The investigated factors (geographical location, experimenter, seed sensitivity to Arsenic poisoning) did not seem to be responsible for the effect inversion. Laboratory external reproducibility of basic research into homeopathic potentisation remains a difficult issue.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19945675&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Estrin, Irene</author><author>Goetz, Raymond</author><author>Hellerstein, David J</author><author>Bennett-Staub, Amy</author><author>Seirmarco, Gretchen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting falls among psychiatric inpatients: a case-control study at a state psychiatric facility.</title><secondary-title>Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)</full-title><abbr-1>Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1245-1250</pages><volume>60</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Accidental Falls/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>Hospitals, Psychiatric*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mental Disorders/drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment/methods</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1557-9700</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1176/ps.2009.60.9.1245</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: The purpose of the study was to add to the research on risk of falling in an understudied population of psychiatric inpatients in an acute setting.; Methods: Five years of fall data in an inpatient psychiatric facility, where falls were frequent but benign, were examined for patient and treatment characteristics that might be associated with falls. This was a retrospective analysis, which matched 1:1 the medical records of fallers and nonfallers on primary psychiatric diagnoses. The total sample consisted of 148 patients. Statistical analysis was conducted on patient demographic characteristics, summed medical history items reported, summed physical complaints on the day of the fall, the number and types of medications taken within a 24-hour period of the fall, and the patient's vital signs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the most salient associations with faller status.; Results: Univariate analyses revealed that fallers were prescribed significantly more medications and complained of more physical symptoms on the day of their fall. Fallers were more likely to have a current acute medical condition and to be currently prescribed clonazepam or antihypertensive medication. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that current physical complaints and current clonazepam treatment had significant associations with faller status.; Conclusions: Risk factors identified in this study should be assessed in replication studies. Psychiatric clinicians can use such risk factors to create evidence-based fall prevention programs.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19723740&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Changling</author><author>Luo, Xiaoxia</author><author>Huang, Xianghu</author><author>Gu, Binhe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influences of temperature on development and survival, reproduction and growth of a calanoid copepod (Pseudodiaptomus dubia).</title><secondary-title>TheScientificWorldJournal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>TheScientificWorldJournal</full-title><abbr-1>TheScientificWorldJournal</abbr-1></periodical><pages>866-879</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Copepoda/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Copepoda/growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Larva/growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Reproduction</keyword><keyword>Temperature*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1537-744X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1100/tsw.2009.96</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Pseudodiaptomus dubia is a calanoid copepod that is distributed widely in the estuarine-coastal waters of Asia and is a dominant copepod in the shrimp grow-out ponds in southern China. A laboratory culture experiment was conducted to evaluate the influences of water temperature on larval development, survival, and reproduction. Results indicate that within a temperature range from 15 to 35 C degrees, larval development increases as the temperature increases. The water temperature for optimal larval survival rate ranges from 20 to 35 C degrees. Longevity and egg hatching time decrease as the temperature increases from 20 to 35 C degrees. Total fecundity and reproduction frequency increase as the water temperature increases, with the maximum at 30 C degrees. Fecundity and reproduction frequency decrease when the temperature exceeds 30 C degrees. Intrinsic growth rate [r(m)] ranges from 0.168 to 0.195 at 25 to 30 C degrees; net reproduction rate [R(0)] and finite growth rate (lambda) are 163 to 264 and 1.183 to 1.215, respectively, when the temperature is greater than 20 and 35 C degrees; population doubling time (t) varies from 3.556 to 4.128 days at temperatures less than 20 and 35 C degrees. Population generation time (T) is negatively correlated with temperature, with the optimal population growth rate at 25 to 30 C degrees.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19734960&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>El Fakhri, Georges</author><author>Kardan, Arash</author><author>Sitek, Arkadiusz</author><author>Dorbala, Sharmila</author><author>Abi-Hatem, Nathalie</author><author>Lahoud, Youmna</author><author>Fischman, Alan</author><author>Coughlan, Martha</author><author>Yasuda, Tsunehiro</author><author>Di Carli, Marcelo F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility and accuracy of quantitative myocardial blood flow assessment with (82)Rb PET: comparison with (13)N-ammonia PET.</title><secondary-title>Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1062-1071</pages><volume>50</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Ammonia*</keyword><keyword>Blood Flow Velocity*</keyword><keyword>Carbon Isotopes</keyword><keyword>Coronary Artery Disease/*diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>Coronary Artery Disease/*physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Coronary Circulation</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Perfusion Imaging/*methods</keyword><keyword>Positron-Emission Tomography/*methods</keyword><keyword>Radiopharmaceuticals</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Rubidium Radioisotopes*</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0161-5505</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2967/jnumed.104.007831</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Unlabelled: (82)Rb cardiac PET allows the assessment of myocardial perfusion with a column generator in clinics that lack a cyclotron. There is evidence that the quantitation of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR) with dynamic (82)Rb PET is feasible. The objectives of this study were to determine the accuracy and reproducibility of MBF estimates from dynamic (82)Rb PET by using our methodology for generalized factor analysis (generalized factor analysis of dynamic sequences [GFADS]) and compartment analysis.; Methods: Reproducibility was evaluated in 22 subjects undergoing dynamic rest and dipyridamole stress (82)Rb PET studies at a 2-wk interval. The inter- and intraobserver variability of MBF quantitation with dynamic (82)Rb PET was assessed with 4 repeated estimations by each of 4 observers. Accuracy was evaluated in 20 subjects undergoing dynamic rest and dipyridamole stress PET studies with (82)Rb and (13)N-ammonia, respectively. The left ventricular and right ventricular blood pool and left ventricular tissue time-activity curves were estimated by GFADS. MBF was estimated by fitting the blood pool and tissue time-activity curves to a 2-compartment kinetic model for (82)Rb and to a 3-compartment model for (13)N-ammonia. CFR was estimated as the ratio of peak MBF to baseline MBF.; Results: The reproducibility of the MBF estimates in repeated (82)Rb studies was very good at rest and during peak stress (R(2)= 0.935), as was the reproducibility of the CFR estimates (R(2) = 0.841). The slope of the correlation line was very close to one for the estimation of MBF (0.986) and CFR (0.960) in repeated (82)Rb studies. The intraobserver reliability was less than 3% for the estimation of MBF at rest and during peak stress as well as for the estimation of CFR. The interobserver reliabilities were 0.950 at rest and 0.975 at peak stress. The correlation between myocardial flow estimates obtained at rest and those obtained during peak stress in (82)Rb and (13)N-ammonia studies was very good (R(2) = 0.857). Bland-Altman plots comparing CFR estimated with (82)Rb and CFR estimated with (13)N-ammonia revealed an underestimation of CFR with (82)Rb compared with (13)N-ammonia; the underestimation was within +/-1.96 SD.; Conclusion: MBF quantitation with GFADS and dynamic (82)Rb PET demonstrated excellent reproducibility as well as intra- and interobserver reliability. The accuracy of the absolute quantitation of MBF with factor and compartment analyses and dynamic (82)Rb PET was very good, compared with that achieved with (13)N-ammonia, for MBF of up to 2.5 mL/g/min.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19525467&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Salgueira, Ana Paula</author><author>Frada, Tiago</author><author>Aguiar, Pedro</author><author>Costa, Manuel JoÃ£o</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Jefferson scale of physician lifelong learning: translation and adaptation for the portuguese medical population].</title><secondary-title>Acta medica portuguesa</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta medica portuguesa</full-title><abbr-1>Acta medica portuguesa</abbr-1></periodical><pages>247-256</pages><volume>22</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Education, Medical, Continuing*</keyword><keyword>Language</keyword><keyword>Learning*</keyword><keyword>Portugal</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1646-0758</isbn><abstract>The competence and professionalism of doctors depend on the process of Lifelong Learning (LLL). In the Portuguese settings, in which the re-certification of physicians' skills or knowledge is currently not required, the exercise of LLL is left to personal motivation and initiative. The importance of LLL has been highlighted in numerous international recommendations and has already led, in the United States, to the development and validation of a scale for measuring physician LLL - the Jefferson Scale of Physician Life Long Learning (JSPLL). The lack of valid instruments to measure LLL adapted to the Portuguese contexts was the basis for this work, which presents the translation and adaptation of JSPLL, and the subsequent validation of the translated version to the Portuguese medical community. The translation and validation of the English version of JSPLL (JSPLL-VP) was conducted with physicians of Health Care institutions in the District of Braga, Portugal, in 2007. Methods of both qualitative (translation, assessment of the translation, retro translation) and quantitative nature (internal consistency analysis, factor analysis and analysis of response frequencies) resulted in a factor analysis that replicated, with the exception of three items, the distribution of the original scale by four factors: professional learning beliefs and motivation, scholarly activities, attention to learning opportunities and technical skills in seeking information. The results show that the JSPLL-VP is a valid Scale fit for purpose. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the whole scale (.89) and for each factor, confirmed the internal consistency of the Scale. Additionally, differences were found between mean and standard deviations for different Scale factors. In summary, this work provides a new validated tool to monitor physician's LLL in Portugal. The transversal characterization of LLL of specific medical professionals - by specialty or by type of institution - or longitudinal studies in relation with profiles of medical training can contribute to the quality of Medical Education at the pre- or post-graduate levels.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19686625&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daley, Denise</author><author>Lemire, Mathieu</author><author>Akhabir, Loubna</author><author>Chan-Yeung, Moira</author><author>He, Jian Qing</author><author>McDonald, Treena</author><author>Sandford, Andrew</author><author>Stefanowicz, Dorota</author><author>Tripp, Ben</author><author>Zamar, David</author><author>Bosse, Yohan</author><author>Ferretti, Vincent</author><author>Montpetit, Alexandre</author><author>Tessier, Marie-Catherine</author><author>Becker, Allan</author><author>Kozyrskyj, Anita L</author><author>Beilby, John</author><author>McCaskie, Pamela A</author><author>Musk, Bill</author><author>Warrington, Nicole</author><author>James, Alan</author><author>Laprise, Catherine</author><author>Palmer, Lyle J</author><author>ParÃ©, Peter D</author><author>Hudson, Thomas J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analyses of associations with asthma in four asthma population samples from Canada and Australia.</title><secondary-title>Human genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Human genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>445-459</pages><volume>125</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Asthma/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Australia</keyword><keyword>Bronchial Hyperreactivity/genetics</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Family</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Genetics, Population</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hypersensitivity, Immediate/genetics</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-1203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00439-009-0643-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Asthma, atopy, and related phenotypes are heterogeneous complex traits, with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Extensive research has been conducted and over hundred genes have been associated with asthma and atopy phenotypes, but many of these findings have failed to replicate in subsequent studies. To separate true associations from false positives, candidate genes need to be examined in large well-characterized samples, using standardized designs (genotyping, phenotyping and analysis). In an attempt to replicate previous associations we amalgamated the power and resources of four studies and genotyped 5,565 individuals to conduct a genetic association study of 93 previously associated candidate genes for asthma and related phenotypes using the same set of 861 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a common genotyping platform, and relatively harmonized phenotypes. We tested for association between SNPs and the dichotomous outcomes of asthma, atopy, atopic asthma, and airway hyperresponsiveness using a general allelic likelihood ratio test. No SNP in any gene reached significance levels that survived correction for all tested SNPs, phenotypes, and genes. Even after relaxing the usual stringent multiple testing corrections by performing a gene-based analysis (one gene at a time as if no other genes were typed) and by stratifying SNPs based on their prior evidence of association, no genes gave strong evidence of replication. There was weak evidence to implicate the following: IL13, IFNGR2, EDN1, and VDR in asthma; IL18, TBXA2R, IFNGR2, and VDR in atopy; TLR9, TBXA2R, VDR, NOD2, and STAT6 in airway hyperresponsiveness; TLR10, IFNGR2, STAT6, VDR, and NPSR1 in atopic asthma. Additionally we found an excess of SNPs with small effect sizes (OR &lt; 1.4). The low rate of replication may be due to small effect size, differences in phenotypic definition, differential environmental effects, and/or genetic heterogeneity. To aid in future replication studies of asthma genes a comprehensive database was compiled and is available to the scientific community at http://genapha.icapture.ubc.ca/.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19247692&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manapat, Michael</author><author>Ohtsuki, Hisashi</author><author>BÃ¼rger, Reinhard</author><author>Nowak, Martin A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Originator dynamics.</title><secondary-title>Journal of theoretical biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of theoretical biology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of theoretical biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>586-595</pages><volume>256</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological Evolution*</keyword><keyword>Models, Genetic*</keyword><keyword>Mutation/physiology</keyword><keyword>Origin of Life*</keyword><keyword>Reproduction/genetics</keyword><keyword>Selection, Genetic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-02-21</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1095-8541</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.10.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We study the origin of evolution. Evolution is based on replication, mutation, and selection. But how does evolution begin? When do chemical kinetics turn into evolutionary dynamics? We propose "prelife" and "prevolution" as the logical precursors of life and evolution. Prelife generates sequences of variable length. Prelife is a generative chemistry that proliferates information and produces diversity without replication. The resulting "prevolutionary dynamics" have mutation and selection. We propose an equation that allows us to investigate the origin of evolution. In one limit, this "originator equation" gives the classical selection equation. In the other limit, we obtain "prelife." There is competition between life and prelife and there can be selection for or against replication. Simple prelife equations with uniform rate constants have the property that longer sequences are exponentially less frequent than shorter ones. But replication can reverse such an ordering. As the replication rate increases, some longer sequences can become more frequent than shorter ones. Thus, replication can lead to "reversals" in the equilibrium portraits. We study these reversals, which mark the transition from prelife to life in our model. If the replication potential exceeds a critical value, then life replicates into existence.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18996397&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ioannidis, John P A</author><author>Allison, David B</author><author>Ball, Catherine A</author><author>Coulibaly, Issa</author><author>Cui, Xiangqin</author><author>Culhane, AedÃ­n C</author><author>Falchi, Mario</author><author>Furlanello, Cesare</author><author>Game, Laurence</author><author>Jurman, Giuseppe</author><author>Mangion, Jon</author><author>Mehta, Tapan</author><author>Nitzberg, Michael</author><author>Page, Grier P</author><author>Petretto, Enrico</author><author>van Noort, Vera</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Repeatability of published microarray gene expression analyses.</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Nature genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>149-155</pages><volume>41</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Data Interpretation, Statistical</keyword><keyword>Databases, Genetic*</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling/*standards</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study/standards</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*standards</keyword><keyword>Peer Review, Research*</keyword><keyword>Publications/standards</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1546-1718</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng.295</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Given the complexity of microarray-based gene expression studies, guidelines encourage transparent design and public data availability. Several journals require public data deposition and several public databases exist. However, not all data are publicly available, and even when available, it is unknown whether the published results are reproducible by independent scientists. Here we evaluated the replication of data analyses in 18 articles on microarray-based gene expression profiling published in Nature Genetics in 2005-2006. One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited. More strict publication rules enforcing public data availability and explicit description of data processing and analysis should be considered.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19174838&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Yu-Ping</author><author>Lu, Yong-Yue</author><author>Zeng, Ling</author><author>Liang, Guang-Wen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Population life parameters and relative fitness of alpharmethrin-resistant Bactrocera dorsalis strain].</title><secondary-title>Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology</full-title><abbr-1>Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>381-386</pages><volume>20</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Ecosystem</keyword><keyword>Insecticides/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Life Cycle Stages/physiology</keyword><keyword>Pyrethrins/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Tephritidae/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Tephritidae/*physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1001-9332</isbn><abstract>Based on the observation of the development and reproduction of experimental populations of alpharmethrin-resistant and susceptible Bactrocera dorsalis strains at (28 +/- 2) degrees C, the life tables of the populations were established, and the differences in the relative ecological fitness of the two strains was analyzed. The results showed that comparing with alpharmethrin-susceptible B. dorsalis strain, the resistant one had longer durations of development stages, average generation, and previposition, its fecundity was not stable and lower, and the hatch of eggs and the emergence of adults were depressed.

Studies in rodent models also suggest that beta cell replication can be induced by certain inflammatory cytokines and by gastrin. We therefore tested the hypothesis that beta cell replication is observed in non-autoimmune human pancreatic disorders in which localised inflammation or elevated gastrin levels are present.; Methods: Resected operative pancreatic specimens were obtained from patients diagnosed with primary adenocarcinoma (with or without chronic severe pancreatitis) or gastrinoma. Additional pancreatic tissue was obtained from autopsy control patients. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess fractional insulin area, beta cell number and replication rate and differentiation factors relevant to beta cell development.; Results: Fractional insulin area was similar among groups. Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and localised chronic severe pancreatitis displayed significant increases in the number of single beta cells, as well as increased beta cell replication rate and levels of neurogenic differentiation 1 in islets. Patients with gastrinoma demonstrated significant increases in the number of single beta cells, but the beta cell replication rate and islet differentiation factor levels were similar to those in the control group.; Conclusions/interpretation: These findings indicate that chronic severe pancreatic inflammation can be associated with significant effects on beta cell number or replication rate, depending on the distribution of the cells. This information may prove useful for attempts seeking to design therapies aimed at inducing beta cell replication as a means of reversing diabetes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19002428&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Orsel, K</author><author>Bouma, A</author><author>Dekker, A</author><author>Stegeman, J A</author><author>de Jong, M C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Foot and mouth disease virus transmission during the incubation period of the disease in piglets, lambs, calves, and dairy cows.</title><secondary-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</full-title><abbr-1>Preventive veterinary medicine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>158-163</pages><volume>88</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Domestic</keyword><keyword>Basic Reproduction Number/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Disease Outbreaks/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Disease Outbreaks/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Disease Transmission, Infectious/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Disease Transmission, Infectious/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Feces/virology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus/*pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Foot-and-Mouth Disease/*transmission</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-02-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0167-5877</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.09.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Transmission of foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus by infected animals may already occur before clinical signs are evident. Quantitative data for FMD transmission rates during this so-called high-risk period are currently lacking and would provide useful information to develop surveillance systems in which the number of new outbreaks is an outcome variable. In order to address this, we used experimental data to quantify transmission in cattle, swine and sheep during the non-clinical phase of the disease. Groups consisted of vaccinated or non-vaccinated animals of one species; half of each group was inoculated with FMDV, the other half was contact-exposed. We estimated the reproduction ratio R(nonclin) using a mathematical SIR model. R(nonclin) was defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual in its non-clinical phase. Animals not showing clinical signs shed lower amounts of virus than clinically affected ones. Therefore, we estimated transmission proportionally to the virus excretion. Low estimates for R(nonclin) in groups with non-vaccinated and vaccinated calves; 0.30 [0.03; 3.43] and 1.03x10(-8) [0; infinity] respectively and 0.21 [0.02; 2.48] for the non-vaccinated and 0.16 [0.009; 2.96] for the vaccinated lambs, were observed. These results indicate that only few secondary infections are to be expected from infected calves and lambs when they are not clinically affected. In groups of non-vaccinated piglets estimates were R(nonclin)=13.20 [4.08; 42.68], and in vaccinated piglets R(nonclin)=1.26 [0.18; 8.96]. The estimate for R(nonclin) for non-vaccinated dairy cows was R(nonclin)=176.65 [80.38; 388.24], whereas R(nonclin) in the vaccinated groups could not be estimated. Our findings suggest that a large number of individuals might have been infected before clinical signs are noticed, especially in non-vaccinated swine and dairy herds.

The estimated time-dependent infectiousness was fitted to three unimodal function shapes (gamma, Weibull and lognormal) for comparison. The absence of infected pigs at 4 DPI revealed a latency period between 4 and 10 DPI. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test whether the parametric shape of the transmission function influenced the estimations. The estimated time-dependent transmission rate was implemented in a deterministic SEIR model and validated by comparing the model prediction with external data. The lognormal-like function shape evidenced the best quality of fit, leading to a latency period of 8 days, an estimated basic reproduction ratio of 5.9 [1.8,10.1] and a mean disease generation time of 18.4 days [18.2, 18.5].</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18559313&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Molleman, Freerk</author><author>Ding, Jimin</author><author>Wang, Jane-Ling</author><author>Zwaan, Bas J</author><author>Carey, James R</author><author>Brakefield, Paul M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adult diet affects lifespan and reproduction of the fruit-feeding butterfly Charaxes fulvescens.</title><secondary-title>Entomologia experimentalis et applicata</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Entomologia experimentalis et applicata</full-title><abbr-1>Entomologia experimentalis et applicata</abbr-1></periodical><pages>54-65</pages><volume>129</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-10-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0013-8703</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1570-7458.2008.00752.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fruit-feeding butterflies are among the longest lived Lepidoptera. While the use of pollen-derived amino acids by Heliconius butterflies has been interpreted as important for the evolution of extended lifespans, very little is known about the life-history consequences of frugivory. This issue is addressed by investigating effects of four adult diets (sugar, sugar with amino acids, banana, and moistened banana) on lifespan and reproduction in the fruit-feeding butterfly Charaxes fulvescens Aurivillius (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Female butterflies were collected from Kibale National Park, Uganda, and kept individually in cages near their natural habitat and data were collected on lifespan, oviposition, and hatching of eggs. Lifespan in captivity was longer for the sugar and the amino acid cohort, than for the banana cohorts. The longitudinal pattern of oviposition was erratic, with many days without oviposition and few periods with high numbers of eggs laid. Butterflies typically did not lay eggs during their 1st week in captivity and the length of the period between capture and first reproduction was significantly shorter for butterflies fed moistened banana. The length of the reproduction period (first reproduction-last reproduction in captivity) and the reproduction rate (total number of eggs/length of the reproduction period) did not differ significantly between the diet treatments. Those fed with amino acid and moistened banana had significantly higher egg hatchability than those fed with sugar and banana. We found no evidence for a lifespan cost of reproduction. Our results show that (1) female C. fulvescens can use amino acids in their diet for laying fertile eggs, (2) more wing-wear does correlate with lower survival in captivity (indicating aging in the wild), but not with intensity of reproduction (providing no evidence for reproductive aging), and (3) fruit-feeding butterflies may be dietary restricted in the field.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19774093&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Combs, Dennis R</author><author>Tosheva, Aneta</author><author>Penn, David L</author><author>Basso, Michael R</author><author>Wanner, Jill L</author><author>Laib, Kristen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Attentional-shaping as a means to improve emotion perception deficits in schizophrenia.</title><secondary-title>Schizophrenia research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Schizophrenia research</full-title><abbr-1>Schizophrenia research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>68-77</pages><volume>105</volume><number>1-3</number><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Attention*</keyword><keyword>Cognition Disorders/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Cognition Disorders/diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Cognition Disorders/psychology</keyword><keyword>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/*methods</keyword><keyword>Emotions*</keyword><keyword>Expressed Emotion*</keyword><keyword>Facial Expression*</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neuropsychological Tests</keyword><keyword>Psychiatric Status Rating Scales</keyword><keyword>Recognition, Psychology</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement, Psychology</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia/diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenic Psychology*</keyword><keyword>Social Behavior</keyword><keyword>Social Perception</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Visual Perception</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0920-9964</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.schres.2008.05.018</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Inability to recognize emotional expressions of others (emotion perception) is one of the most common impairments observed among individuals with schizophrenia. Such deficits presumably contribute much to the social dysfunction characteristic of schizophrenia. This study examined the efficacy of a novel attentional-shaping intervention to improve emotion perception abilities. Sixty participants with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions: 1) attentional-shaping, 2) contingent monetary reinforcement, or 3) repeated practice. Participants completed the Face Emotion Identification Test (FEIT) at pre-test, intervention, post-test, and one week follow-up. Participants also completed the Bell-Lysaker Emotion Recognition Test (BLERT) and the Social Behavior Scale at pre-test and follow-up to measure generalization. The results showed that the attentional-shaping condition had significantly higher scores on the FEIT at intervention, post-test, and follow-up compared to monetary reinforcement and repeated practice. Improvement was also found on the BLERT and a trend was found for improved social behaviors at one-week follow-up. Results will be discussed in terms of face scanning and attentional deficits present in schizophrenia and potential uses of this intervention in the remediation of emotion perception deficits.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18585899&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watanabe, Yoshihisa</author><author>Shibata, Kiyoshi</author><author>Ikemura, Toshimichi</author><author>Maekawa, Masato</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication timing of extremely large genes on human chromosomes 11q and 21q.</title><secondary-title>Gene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gene</full-title><abbr-1>Gene</abbr-1></periodical><pages>74-80</pages><volume>421</volume><number>1-2</number><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11*</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21*</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>Genes*</keyword><keyword>Genome, Human</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Jurkat Cells</keyword><keyword>S Phase/genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-09-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1119</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.gene.2008.06.016</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many human genes have been mapped precisely in the genome. These genes vary from a few kb to more than 1 Mb in length. Previously, we measured replication timing along the entire lengths of human chromosomes 11q and 21q at the sequence level. In the present study, we used the newest information for human chromosomes 11q and 21q to analyze the replication timing of 30 extremely large genes (&gt;250 kb) in two human cell lines (THP-1 and Jurkat). The timing of replication differed between the 5'- and 3'-ends of each of extremely large genes on 11q and 21q, and the time interval between their replication varied among genes of different lengths. The large genes analyzed here included several tissue-specific genes associated with neural diseases and genes encoding cell adhesion molecules: some of these genes had different patterns of replication timing between the two cell lines. The amyloid precursor protein gene (APP), which is associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD1), showed the largest difference in timing of replication between its 5'- and 3'-ends in relation to gene length of all the large genes studied on 11q and 21q. These extremely large genes were concentrated in and around genomic regions in which replication timing switches from early to late on both 11q and 21q. The differences of replication timing between the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions of large genes may be related to the molecular mechanisms that underlie tissue-specific expression.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18620035&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eklund, Martin</author><author>Spjuth, Ola</author><author>Wikberg, Jarl Es</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The C1C2: a framework for simultaneous model selection and assessment.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title><abbr-1>BMC bioinformatics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>360</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Algorithms*</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Data Interpretation, Statistical*</keyword><keyword>Database Management Systems*</keyword><keyword>Databases, Factual*</keyword><keyword>Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological*</keyword><keyword>Models, Statistical*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-09-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2105</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-9-360</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: There has been recent concern regarding the inability of predictive modeling approaches to generalize to new data. Some of the problems can be attributed to improper methods for model selection and assessment. Here, we have addressed this issue by introducing a novel and general framework, the C1C2, for simultaneous model selection and assessment. The framework relies on a partitioning of the data in order to separate model choice from model assessment in terms of used data. Since the number of conceivable models in general is vast, it was also of interest to investigate the employment of two automatic search methods, a genetic algorithm and a brute-force method, for model choice. As a demonstration, the C1C2 was applied to simulated and real-world datasets. A penalized linear model was assumed to reasonably approximate the true relation between the dependent and independent variables, thus reducing the model choice problem to a matter of variable selection and choice of penalizing parameter. We also studied the impact of assuming prior knowledge about the number of relevant variables on model choice and generalization error estimates. The results obtained with the C1C2 were compared to those obtained by employing repeated K-fold cross-validation for choosing and assessing a model.; Results: The C1C2 framework performed well at finding the true model in terms of choosing the correct variable subset and producing reasonable choices for the penalizing parameter, even in situations when the independent variables were highly correlated and when the number of observations was less than the number of variables. The C1C2 framework was also found to give accurate estimates of the generalization error. Prior information about the number of important independent variables improved the variable subset choice but reduced the accuracy of generalization error estimates. Using the genetic algorithm worsened the model choice but not the generalization error estimates, compared to using the brute-force method. The results obtained with repeated K-fold cross-validation were similar to those produced by the C1C2 in terms of model choice, however a lower accuracy of the generalization error estimates was observed.; Conclusion: The C1C2 framework was demonstrated to work well for finding the true model within a penalized linear model class and accurately assess its generalization error, even for datasets with many highly correlated independent variables, a low observation-to-variable ratio, and model assumption deviations. A complete separation of the model choice and the model assessment in terms of data used for each task improves the estimates of the generalization error.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18761753&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bianchini, Adalto</author><author>Wood, Chris M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does sulfide or water hardness protect against chronic silver toxicity in Daphnia magna?

Results showed that both sulfide and water hardness protected against lethal acute and chronic silver toxicity in terms of mortality. However, only sulfide showed a protective effect against the sub-lethal chronic silver effects on growth and reproduction. These findings suggest that both reactive sulfide and water hardness must be taken into account in the development of a chronic version of the Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) for waterborne silver. Furthermore, acute-to-chronic ratio values for silver toxicity showed that only small increases in toxicity are seen over the chronic exposure relative to the acute toxicity. Mortality is the most sensitive endpoint in moderately hard water and in the presence of sulfide. Reproduction, measured as the number of neonates produced per adult per reproduction day, is the most sensitive one in hard water in the absence of sulfide.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18472162&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jenke, Andreas C W</author><author>Wilhelm, Andreas D</author><author>Orth, Valerie</author><author>Lipps, Hans Joachim</author><author>Protzer, Ulrike</author><author>Wirth, Stefan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term suppression of hepatitis B virus replication by short hairpin RNA expression using the scaffold/matrix attachment region-based replicating vector system pEPI-1.</title><secondary-title>Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy</full-title><abbr-1>Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2355-2359</pages><volume>52</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Genetic Vectors*</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis B virus/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis B virus/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis B, Chronic/therapy</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis B, Chronic/virology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Matrix Attachment Regions/genetics</keyword><keyword>Plasmids/genetics</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger/genetics</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger/metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/*genetics</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/*genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1098-6596</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/AAC.00067-08</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Since the emergence of viral resistance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) during treatment is becoming an important issue even with newer drugs, there is a need for alternative treatment options such as, for example, RNA interference (RNAi) technology. While short-term suppression of HBV replication is easily achieved with small interfering RNA oligonucleotides, this is not the case for long-term suppression due to the lack of an optimal vector system. Based on the nonviral scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR)-based vector system pEPI-1, which is free of common side effects and is stably retained as an episome even in the absence of selection, we designed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vector called pEPI-RNAi for HBV suppression. HBV-replicating HepG2.2.15 cells were transfected with pEPI-RNAi, and the intracellular status of the plasmid was followed by PCR and Southern analysis. HBV replication was measured on the DNA, RNA, and protein level. HBV RNA expression was reduced by almost 85% 3 months posttransfection with pEPI-RNAi. At 8 months posttransfection in the absence of antibiotic selection pressure, the suppression level was still 70% and the vector was retained as an episome. The reduction of total intracellular HBV DNA at this point was 77%, showing a marked suppression of HBV DNA replication. At a comparable level, secretion of viral antigens, as well as progeny HBV virions, was inhibited. The S/MAR-based vector system pEPI-1 allows long-term suppression of HBV replication by the expression of suitable shRNAs. Due to its unique properties compared to commonly used vectors, it provides an interesting option for the treatment of chronically HBV-infected individuals.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18474581&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scorah, Jennifer</author><author>Dong, Meng-Qiu</author><author>Yates, John R, 3rd</author><author>Scott, Mary</author><author>Gillespie, David</author><author>McGowan, Clare H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A conserved proliferating cell nuclear antigen-interacting protein sequence in Chk1 is required for checkpoint function.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of biological chemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>17250-17259</pages><volume>283</volume><number>25</number><issue>25</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Checkpoint Kinase 1</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication</keyword><keyword>DNA/chemistry</keyword><keyword>HeLa Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hydroxyurea/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinases/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinases/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Sequence Homology, Amino Acid</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-06-20</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9258</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M800369200</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Human checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is an essential kinase required for cell cycle checkpoints and for coordination of DNA synthesis. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which Chk1 carries out these functions, we used mass spectrometry to identify previously uncharacterized interacting partners of Chk1. We describe a novel interaction between Chk1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an essential component of the replication machinery. Binding between Chk1 and PCNA was reduced in the presence of hydroxyurea, suggesting that the interaction is regulated by replication stress. A highly conserved PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box motif was identified in Chk1. The intact PIP box is required for efficient DNA damage-induced phosphorylation and release of activated Chk1 from chromatin. We find that the PIP box of Chk1 is crucial for Chk1-mediated S-M and G(2)-M checkpoint responses. In addition, we show that mutations in the PIP box of Chk1 lead to decreased rates of replication fork progression and increased aberrant replication. These findings suggest an additional mechanism by which essential components of the DNA replication machinery interact with the replication checkpoint apparatus.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18448427&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biellmann, Franziska</author><author>Henion, Timothy R</author><author>BÃ¼rki, Kurt</author><author>Hennet, Thierry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impaired sexual behavior in male mice deficient for the beta1-3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I gene.</title><secondary-title>Molecular reproduction and development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular reproduction and development</full-title><abbr-1>Molecular reproduction and development</abbr-1></periodical><pages>699-706</pages><volume>75</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Axons/*enzymology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/genetics</keyword><keyword>Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, Knockout</keyword><keyword>N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/genetics</keyword><keyword>Olfactory Bulb/*enzymology</keyword><keyword>Olfactory Receptor Neurons/*enzymology</keyword><keyword>Organ Size/physiology</keyword><keyword>Polysaccharides/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Polysaccharides/genetics</keyword><keyword>Reproduction/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Sexual Behavior, Animal/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Sperm Count</keyword><keyword>Spermatogenesis/genetics</keyword><keyword>Testis/enzymology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1098-2795</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/mrd.20828</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The beta1-3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (B3gnt1) gene encodes a poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthase which can initiate and extend poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains [Gal(beta1-4)GlcNAc (beta1-3)(n)]. Previous investigations with heterozygous and homozygous null mice for this gene have revealed the importance of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains for the formation of olfactory axon connections with the olfactory bulb and the migration of gonadotropin releasing hormone neurons to the hypothalamus. The possible long-term effects of these developmental defects, however, has not yet been studied. Here we have examined a reproductive phenotype observed in B3gnt1-null mice. Whereas the B3gnt1 null females were fertile, the B3gnt1 null males were not able to sire litters at the expected rate when mated to either wildtype or B3gnt1-null females. We assessed male sexual behavior as well as male reproduction parameters such as testes size, spermatogenesis, sperm number, morphology, and the development of early embryos in order to identify the source of a reduced rate of reproduction. Our findings show that the B3gnt1 null male reproductive organs were functional and could not account for the lower rate at which they produced offspring with wildtype conspecifics. Hence, we propose that the phenotype observed resulted from an impaired sexual response to female mating partners.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18008318&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Celle, Olivier</author><author>Blanchard, Philippe</author><author>Olivier, Violaine</author><author>Schurr, Frank</author><author>Cougoule, Nicolas</author><author>Faucon, Jean-Paul</author><author>RibiÃ¨re, Magali</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detection of Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) genome and its replicative RNA form in various hosts and possible ways of spread.</title><secondary-title>Virus research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virus research</full-title><abbr-1>Virus research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>280-284</pages><volume>133</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Ants/*virology</keyword><keyword>Bees/*virology</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Genome, Viral</keyword><keyword>Insect Viruses/*isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Insect Viruses/genetics</keyword><keyword>Insect Viruses/physiology</keyword><keyword>Mites/*virology</keyword><keyword>Paralysis/virology</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>RNA Viruses/*isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>RNA Viruses/genetics</keyword><keyword>RNA Viruses/physiology</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/genetics</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0168-1702</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.virusres.2007.12.011</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Detection of Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) is reported for the first time in two species of ants (Camponotus vagus and Formica rufa) and in Varroa destructor.

Variation in repeat number occurs so frequently that microsatellites can be used for genotyping and forensic analysis. However, an accurate assessment of the rates of change can be difficult because the presence of many repeats makes it difficult to determine whether changes have occurred through single or multiple events. The current study was undertaken to experimentally assess the rates of replication slippage that occur in vivo in the chloroplast DNA of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. A reporter construct was created in which a stretch of AAAG repeats was inserted into a functional gene to allow changes to be observed when they occurred at the synthetic microsatellite. Restoration of the reading frame occurred through replication slippage in 15 of every million viable cells. Since only one-third of the potential insertion/deletion events would restore the reading frame, the frequency of change could be deduced to be 4.5 x 10(-5). Analysis of the slippage events showed that template slippage was the primary event, resulting in deletions rather than duplications. These findings contrasted with events observed in Escherichia coli during maintenance of the plasmid, where duplications were the rule.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18263764&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Savin, Douglas N</author><author>Morton, Susanne M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Asymmetric generalization between the arm and leg following prism-induced visuomotor adaptation.</title><secondary-title>Experimental brain research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental brain research</full-title><abbr-1>Experimental brain research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>175-182</pages><volume>186</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptation, Ocular/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Arm/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Eyeglasses*</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Functional Laterality</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Leg/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Posture*</keyword><keyword>Walking/*physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-1106</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00221-007-1220-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We have previously shown an asymmetric generalization following a prism-induced visuomotor adaptation. Subjects who adapt to laterally deviating prism lenses during walking show a broad generalization to an arm pointing task, while subjects who adapt to prisms during arm pointing do not show generalization to walking. It is not known whether this broad generalization persists with other movements outside of walking or what specific features of the walking task, e.g. lower extremity involvement, allow it to be so broadly generalizable. In the current study, we tested healthy adult subjects performing one of three forms of prism adaptation and subsequently measured generalization. In Experiment 1 we tested whether a seated arm pointing prism adaptation would generalize to the leg. In Experiment 2 we tested whether a seated leg pointing prism adaptation would generalize to the arm. In Experiment 3 we tested whether standing influenced the extent of generalization from leg to arm. Results were surprising. We found a clear and consistent generalization from arm to leg, but much less so from leg to arm during either the seated or the standing task. These findings indicate that prism adaptations during arm movements are not limb-specific, as has been previously suggested. Further, the lack of generalization from leg to arm suggests that neither the adaptation of leg movements specifically, nor standing posture, nor the bilateral component of walking could be the salient feature allowing for its broad generalization across body parts.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=18057927&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Chia-Lin</author><author>Federmeier, Kara D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>To watch, to see, and to differ: an event-related potential study of concreteness effects as a function of word class and lexical ambiguity.</title><secondary-title>Brain and language</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain and language</full-title><abbr-1>Brain and language</abbr-1></periodical><pages>145-158</pages><volume>104</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Brain Mapping</keyword><keyword>Comprehension/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Evoked Potentials*</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Language*</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Psycholinguistics</keyword><keyword>Reaction Time</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0093-934X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bandl.2007.06.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Electrophysiological techniques were used to assess the generalizability of concreteness effects on word processing across word class (nouns and verbs) and different types of lexical ambiguity (syntactic only and combined syntactic/semantic).

The effect of concreteness on the N400 generalized to all word class and ambiguity conditions, whereas the frontal effect was present for all word types except for the syntactically and semantically ambiguous items when these were used as verbs.

In the client's perception, however, there was a significant difference only on directivity, with analytically-oriented therapists receiving higher scores. A replication study on 25 client-centered relationships showed a sharp increase on transparency in the client's perception.

In a previous study (J. J. Horan et al, 1977) the exposure component ( which involved 6 practice sessions) proved ineffective; moreover, the efficacy of the other components was not repeated on the generalization measures. The present study with 28 female undergraduates compared 3 variations in the exposure component and found that training with a single practice session on the cold pressor task proved more helpful than training with no practice at all, which in turn was no worse than training with 6 practice sessions. Moreover, therapeutic attention to generalization resulted in increased pain tolerance on the pressure algometer task.

In 2 experiments college students guessed whether a slide having a dot on it would follow a slide presenting a word. Although several words were presented, the dot followed only one of the words, and then in accordance with a particular reinforcement (PR) schedule. In Exp I, 234 Ss responded to a PR-0, -25, -50, -75, or -100% schedule. After acquiring a 'yes' (a dot will follow) response to the reinforced word, generalization was assessed through differential resistance to extinction toward a synonym, a homonym, and 2 words unrelated to the conditioning word. Exp II used only a PR-25% group of 105 Ss. In both experiments Ss' acquired rate of 'yes' responses tended to match the probability of reinforcement involved in their PR schedule. In both studies generalization was greatest toward synonyms, less toward homonyms, and least toward irrelevant words. However, the differential magnitude of semantic generalization over homophonic generalization was slight, and diminished and disappeared rapidly as a function of extinction trials.

Each S answered 1/2 of the test items under a condition of white noise and 1/2 without white noise. As a separate experimental dimension, each S repeated 1/2 of the proverb items before his answer and did not repeat the other 1/2. Results indicate that voice volume was significantly increased in all groups when performing under white noise. Analysis of generalization (G) scores (abstraction) indicates that within the general context of normals exceeding good premorbid schizophrenics and goods exceeding poors, white noise had opposing effects on the good and poor premorbid schizophrenic Ss, especially under the no-repetition condition. Good premorbids increased and poor premorbids decreased G scores under the white noise. Information (I) scores were significantly higher among normals than among the poor premorbid schizophrenics, with the good premorbid schizophrenics falling in between. Results on the symbolic reasoning (SR = G  I) followed the G score results but were less strong. Results are discussed in terms of proprioceptive feedback, redundancy, and arousal interpretations of schizophrenia. (28 ref.)

Several investigators have suggested that problems in the family system may be responsible for the failures that occur. The present paper reviews the relationship between 3 family problem variables (parental maladjustment, marital difficulties, and dysfunctional extrafamilial interactions) and child behavior problems and their treatment. The available data suggest that there is a positive relationship between child behavior problems and problems in each of the 3 types af family variables. Furthermore, although less conclusive, some data suggest that the outcome of PT is affected adversely by poor parental personal, marital, and extrafamilial adjustment. Assessment of generalization from PT to family problems has yielded mixed results; generalization has occurred primarily to parental personal adjustment. Comparisons of PT alone to PT plus treatment of family problems are suggested.

It was possible to predict the observed degree of similarity from measurements of certain parameters of the shapes. The important parameters were found to be the shape area and the ratio between the length of outline of a shape and the area it encloses (contour density), so that the percentage of responses to the test shape was a linear function of the contour density of the training shape, the contour density of the test shape, the area of the training shape, and the area of the test shape. Mechanisms by which the bee might measure these parameters are discussed.

The present study evaluated the replicability of 6 commonly found Horn-Waingrow factors in 109 men and women from 3 longitudinal studies and also examined gender and other psychosocial differences. Principal component analyses exactly replicated Ikard's reported factors, separately for each gender. Significant gender differences in level were shown for 2 smoking motives (Reduction of Negative Affect and Pleasure); women more than men reported that they smoke for these reasons. Also, there were significant differences in motives between current and former smokers and between smokers with and without smoking spouses.

Acute pretreatments of 3.2â27.8 mg/kg morphine 4â24 hrs before a generalization test resulted in minor changes in the minimal discriminable dose. Greater tolerance developed to the morphine stimulus when training was suspended than when training was continued. For both training conditions, response rates during generalization tests were markedly suppressed during supplemental morphine administration, and original generalization gradients were recaptured within 2 wks after termination of supplemental morphine administration. The magnitude of tolerance to a morphine discriminative stimulus reflected an interaction of supplemental drug treatment with the training conditions imposed during that treatment.

The experiment included a training phase, designed to establish the effectiveness of the helplessness induction in noncontingent reinforcement Ss, and a test phase, designed to assess helplessness generalization. Results indicate that noncontingent feedback group Ss demonstrated increased levels of affect (anxiety, depression, and hostility) following the training phase, indicating a successful helplessness induction. However, no significant differences were observed between the groups on the subsequent test task, suggesting that helplessness failed to generalize. A 15-min time delay between the test and training phase did not affect the performance of the noncontingent group, although an unexpected main effect was observed, with all Ss who experienced the delay demonstrating facilitated performance. Results are discussed in terms of the reformulated learned helplessness model and extensions to it.

Previous experiments showed that intradermal injection of pigs with FMD virus 14 days after vaccination was not suitable to start an infection chain, as inoculated vaccinated pigs resisted challenge. Therefore, we carried out two experiments in which we used direct contact to a non-vaccinated pig as route of infection. In the first experiment only the vaccine effect on susceptibility was quantified by exposing pigs, either vaccinated 14 days before or not vaccinated, each to a non-vaccinated seeder pig inoculated with FMD virus O/NET/2001. Since no significant differences were observed between contact infections in vaccinated or non-vaccinated pigs, we performed a second experiment in which both susceptibility and infectivity were subject to vaccination. We quantified virus transmission in homogenous groups of vaccinated or non-vaccinated pigs in which the infection chain was started by exposure to a third group of non-vaccinated infected pigs. Transmission occurred to all contact-exposed pigs in the non-vaccinated groups and to 9 out of 10 contact-exposed pigs in the vaccinated groups. The rate of transmission (beta) was significantly reduced in the vaccine group. Yet, the estimated reproduction ratio in both groups was still above 1. In conclusion, by adjusting our transmission study design and challenge method, we were able to quantify transmission of FMDV among vaccinated pigs. According to this study a single vaccination was not sufficient to stop pig to pig virus transmission. With these results major outbreaks may still be expected, even in groups of vaccinated pigs.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17658199&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacCarthy, Thomas</author><author>Bergman, Aviv</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coevolution of robustness, epistasis, and recombination favors asexual reproduction.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</abbr-1></periodical><pages>12801-12806</pages><volume>104</volume><number>31</number><issue>31</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological Evolution*</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Epistasis, Genetic*</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological</keyword><keyword>Recombination, Genetic/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Reproduction, Asexual/*physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-07-31</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.0705455104</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The prevalence of sexual reproduction remains one of the most perplexing phenomena in evolutionary biology. The deterministic mutation hypothesis postulates that sexual reproduction will be advantageous under synergistic epistasis, a condition in which mutations cause a greater reduction in fitness when combined than would be expected from their individual effects. The inverse condition, antagonistic epistasis, correspondingly is predicted to favor asexual reproduction. To assess this hypothesis, we introduce a finite population evolutionary process that combines a recombination modifier formalism with a gene-regulatory network model. We demonstrate that when reproductive mode and epistasis are allowed to coevolve, asexual reproduction outcompetes sexual reproduction. In addition, no correlation is found between the level of synergistic epistasis and the fixation time of the asexual mode. However, a significant correlation is found between the level of antagonistic epistasis and asexual mode fixation time. This asymmetry can be explained by the greater reduction in fitness imposed by sexual reproduction as compared with asexual reproduction. Our findings present evidence and suggest plausible explanations that challenge both the deterministic mutation hypothesis and recent arguments asserting the importance of emergent synergistic epistasis in the maintenance of sexual reproduction.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17646644&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borodina, Yulia V</author><author>Bolton, Evan</author><author>Fontaine, Fabien</author><author>Bryant, Stephen H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of conformational ensemble sizes necessary for specific resolutions of coverage of conformational space.</title><secondary-title>Journal of chemical information and modeling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of chemical information and modeling</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of chemical information and modeling</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1428-1437</pages><volume>47</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Models, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Molecular Conformation*</keyword><keyword>X-Ray Diffraction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1549-9596</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/ci7000956</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The size of conformational ensembles required for regular coverage of the conformational space of druglike molecules was examined.

To seek for molecular links, we employed an established cell culture model for viral replication, and assessed how the expression of an HCV subgenomic replicon affects iron metabolism in host Huh7 hepatoma cells.; Methods: The expression of iron metabolism genes and parameters defining the cellular iron status were analyzed and compared between parent and replicon Huh7 cells.; Results: By using the IronChip microarray platform, we observed replicon-induced changes in expression profiles of iron metabolism genes. Notably, ceruloplasmin mRNA and protein expression were decreased in replicon cells. In addition, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) was also downregulated, while ferroportin levels were elevated, resulting in reduced iron uptake and increased iron release capacity of replicon cells. These responses were associated with an iron-deficient phenotype, manifested in decreased levels of the "labile iron pool" and concomitant induction of IRE-binding activity and IRP2 expression. Furthermore, hemin-treated replicon cells exhibited a defect in retaining iron. The clearance of the replicon by prolonged treatment with interferon-alpha only partially reversed the iron-deficient phenotype but almost completely restored the capacity of cured cells to retain iron.; Conclusions: We propose that Huh7 cells undergo genetic reprogramming to permit subgenomic viral replication that results in reduction of intracellular iron levels. This response may provide a mechanism to bypass iron-mediated inactivation of the viral RNA polymerase NS5B.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17399844&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fernando, Chrisantha</author><author>Von Kiedrowski, GÃ¼nter</author><author>SzathmÃ¡ry, EÃ¶rs</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A stochastic model of nonenzymatic nucleic acid replication: "elongators" sequester replicators.</title><secondary-title>Journal of molecular evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of molecular evolution</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of molecular evolution</abbr-1></periodical><pages>572-585</pages><volume>64</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Enzymes</keyword><keyword>Models, Chemical*</keyword><keyword>Models, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Conformation</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Denaturation</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Renaturation</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acids/*chemical synthesis</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acids/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Stochastic Processes</keyword><keyword>Templates, Genetic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-2844</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00239-006-0218-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The origin of nucleic acid template replication is a major unsolved problem in science. A novel stochastic model of nucleic acid chemistry was developed to allow rapid prototyping of chemical experiments designed to discover sufficient conditions for template replication. Experiments using the model brought to attention a robust property of nucleic acid template populations, the tendency for elongation to outcompete replication. Externally imposed denaturation-renaturation cycles did not reverse this tendency. For example, it has been proposed that fast tidal cycling could establish a TCR (tidal chain reaction) analogous to a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) acting on nucleic acid polymers, allowing their self-replication. However, elongating side-reactions that would have been prevented by the polymerase in the PCR still occurred in the simulation of the TCR. The same finding was found with temperature and monomer cycles. We propose that if cycling reactors are to allow template replication, oligonucleotide phenotypes that are capable of favorably altering the flux ratio between replication and elongation, for example, by facilitating sequence-specific cleavage within templates, are necessary; accordingly the minimal replicase ribozyme may have possessed restriction functionality.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17437149&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MuÃ±oz, Laura Diaz</author><author>SerramÃ­a, Maria JesÃºs</author><author>Fresno, Manuel</author><author>MuÃ±oz-FernÃ¡ndez, Maria Angeles</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Progesterone inhibits HIV-1 replication in human trophoblast cells through inhibition of autocrine tumor necrosis factor secretion.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of infectious diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of infectious diseases</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of infectious diseases</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1294-1302</pages><volume>195</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Flow Cytometry</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections/physiopathology</keyword><keyword>HIV Long Terminal Repeat/drug effects</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>NF-kappa B/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Progesterone/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger/analysis</keyword><keyword>Trophoblasts/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/*drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-05-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-1899</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/513434</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Progesterone levels are higher in placental barriers during pregnancy, but the effect of progesterone on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in placental cells has not been addressed. We hypothesize that progesterone may affect HIV infection.; Methods: Purified trophoblastic cells and trophoblastic cell lines were infected or transfected with HIV-1, and the effect of progesterone was analyzed. Viral replication was measured by viral p24 or viral load quantification. Nuclear factor kappa -B (NF- kappa B) or long terminal repeat (LTR)-dependent transcription was measured by luciferase assays. Expression of chemokine receptors was analyzed by flow cytometry. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) messenger RNA was assessed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR.; Results: Progesterone inhibits HIV-1 replication in placental cells at the concentration found in the placental interface, at a postentry step, and does not affect cell surface expression of chemokine receptors. Progesterone did not inhibit basal or induced LTR transcription or NF- kappa B activation. TNF synthesis in placental cells is induced by HIV-1 infection that, in an autocrine manner, activates viral replication, because neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies block it. Progesterone inhibits the induction of TNF synthesis by viral infection and virus or gp-120-induced TNF transcription.; Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that progesterone inhibits HIV-1 replication in placental cells by reducing TNF levels, which are required for optimal viral replication.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17396998&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Orsel, K</author><author>Dekker, A</author><author>Bouma, A</author><author>Stegeman, J A</author><author>de Jong, M C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantification of foot and mouth disease virus excretion and transmission within groups of lambs with and without vaccination.</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title><abbr-1>Vaccine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2673-2679</pages><volume>25</volume><number>14</number><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Viral/blood</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus/*isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Foot-and-Mouth Disease/*transmission</keyword><keyword>Sheep</keyword><keyword>Vaccination*</keyword><keyword>Viral Vaccines/*immunology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-03-30</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0264-410X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.11.048</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sheep are well known to be susceptible for foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), but it is unknown whether the infection can spread and persist in a sheep population. We therefore quantified virus transmission by performing experiments with FMD virus strain O/NET/2001 in groups of lambs. We used six groups of four lambs each, in which half of each group was inoculated and the other half was contact-exposed. To quantify the effectiveness of a single vaccination we also included six groups of four lambs each, vaccinated with O Manisa vaccine, 14 days prior to inoculation. Oropharyngeal fluid was obtained with a swab (OPF-swab), and blood samples were collected daily to determine virus excretion and serological response. We calculated the transmission rate beta (the number of new infections per day per infectious animal), and the reproduction ratio R (the number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual). The mean daily virus excretion and the number of days the lambs excreted virus in the OPF differed significantly between vaccinated and non-vaccinated lambs. The transmission rate beta in the unvaccinated groups was 0.105 (95% confidence limit 0.044; 0.253) per day. The duration of the infectious period (T) was 21.11 (95% confidence limit 10.6; 42.1) days. With the final size of infection we estimated the reproduction ratio R in the non-vaccinated groups to be 1.14 (0.3; 3.3), and in vaccinated groups 0.22 (0.01; 1.78). Virus transmission as quantified by the final size did not differ statistically between the vaccinated and the non-vaccinated groups of lambs. In conclusion, FMDV seems able to persist in a sheep population, although the reproduction ratio was only slightly larger than one. As a consequence, vaccination might only have a small effect on transmission, in spite of the fact that virus excretion and duration of virus excretion is significantly reduced after vaccination.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17254674&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sofyan, Agus</author><author>Rosita, Gina</author><author>Price, David J</author><author>Birge, Wesley J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cadmium uptake by Ceriodaphnia dubia from different exposures: relevance to body burden and toxicity.</title><secondary-title>Environmental toxicology and chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental toxicology and chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>Environmental toxicology and chemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>470-477</pages><volume>26</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Burden</keyword><keyword>Cadmium/*pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Cadmium/analysis</keyword><keyword>Cadmium/toxicity</keyword><keyword>Cladocera/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Environmental Exposure*</keyword><keyword>Feeding Behavior</keyword><keyword>Fresh Water</keyword><keyword>Reproduction</keyword><keyword>Water Pollutants, Chemical/pharmacokinetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0730-7268</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1897/06-232r.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Uptake of cadmium from water by freshwater animals has been well documented. However, little attention has been given to the importance of dietary and combined exposure as the source for uptake. In the present study, we compared cadmium uptake from waterborne (water-only), dietary (food-only), and combined (water plus food) exposures on the freshwater cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia. Major test end points included cadmium whole-body burdens, feeding rate, and reproduction. The C. dubia three-brood reproduction tests were conducted according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency methods. The results indicated that cadmium was accumulated from both water and diet. Whereas the results showed that uptake from water was more rapid than uptake from diet, both uptakes occurred independently, and cadmium concentrations in C. dubia were additive from both sources. Furthermore, the present study found cadmium trophic transfer between primary producers (i.e., Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and primary consumers (i.e., C. dubia). Feeding rate was reduced from all avenues of exposure. Feeding reduction in combined exposure was affected additively by waterborne and dietary cadmium. Also, reductions in neonate production were observed after exposure to all three exposure types. Both body burden and reduced feeding affected C. dubia reproduction. These results indicate the importance of both waterborne and dietary cadmium exposures as the sources for metal uptake and toxicity.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17373510&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, S</author><author>Opriessnig, T</author><author>Kitikoon, P</author><author>Nilubol, D</author><author>Halbur, P G</author><author>Thacker, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) distribution and replication in tissues and immune cells in early infected pigs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary immunology and immunopathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary immunology and immunopathology</full-title><abbr-1>Veterinary immunology and immunopathology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>261-272</pages><volume>115</volume><number>3-4</number><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Viral/blood</keyword><keyword>B-Lymphocytes/immunology</keyword><keyword>B-Lymphocytes/virology</keyword><keyword>Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/immunology</keyword><keyword>Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/virology</keyword><keyword>Capsid Proteins/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Capsid Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Circoviridae Infections/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Circoviridae Infections/blood</keyword><keyword>Circoviridae Infections/immunology</keyword><keyword>Circoviridae Infections/virology</keyword><keyword>Circovirus/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Circovirus/genetics</keyword><keyword>Circovirus/immunology</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/chemistry</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/genetics</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Flow Cytometry/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Lymphoid Tissue/*virology</keyword><keyword>Lymphoid Tissue/immunology</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger/chemistry</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger/genetics</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/chemistry</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/genetics</keyword><keyword>Statistics, Nonparametric</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/*virology</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/immunology</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes/immunology</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes/virology</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-02-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0165-2427</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.11.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replication of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in pigs, as measured by spliced capsid mRNA (Cap mRNA) and viral DNA, was investigated following experimental infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and tissue from bronchial lymph nodes (BLN), inguinal lymph nodes (ILN), tonsils, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen and thymus from infected pigs on different days post-infection (DPI) were assessed. PCV2 replication differed dramatically between tissues from the same infected pig. The virus actively replicated in most tested tissues at 14DPI in association with increased PCV2 associated lesions and PCV2 antigen levels, although no clinical signs correlated with PCV2 associated disease were observed in infected pigs during the course of the study. The PCV2 Cap mRNA was detected only at 13DPI in PBMCs from infected pigs, suggesting replication of the virus in circulating blood is transient and not a major site for PCV2 replication in vivo. Evaluation of the Cap mRNA and viral DNA synthesis in T and B lymphocyte and monocyte populations from PBMCs and BLN at various intervals post-inoculation revealed replication of PCV2 in all cell subpopulations; however, viral replication in B lymphocytes was greater than observed in mononuclear cells isolated from BLN at 14DPI indicating that B lymphocytes may be an important cell population for PCV2 replication. These findings further our understanding of the cell types permissive for PCV2 replication and the pathogenesis of PCV2 infection in vivo.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17175030&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Siddiqui, Waheed H</author><author>Stump, Donald G</author><author>Reynolds, Vincent L</author><author>Plotzke, Kathleen P</author><author>Holson, Joseph F</author><author>Meeks, Robert G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A two-generation reproductive toxicity study of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) in rats exposed by whole-body vapor inhalation.</title><secondary-title>Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)</full-title><abbr-1>Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>216-225</pages><volume>23</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Administration, Inhalation</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn/growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Body Weight/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fertility/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Inhalation Exposure</keyword><keyword>Litter Size/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Longevity/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level</keyword><keyword>Organ Size/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Rats, Sprague-Dawley</keyword><keyword>Reproduction/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Sexual Maturation/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Sexual Maturation/physiology</keyword><keyword>Siloxanes/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Spermatogenesis/drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0890-6238</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.reprotox.2006.11.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This two-generation reproduction study assessed the reproductive hazard potential of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D(5)). Sprague-Dawley rats (30/sex/group) were exposed by whole-body vapor inhalation to a target concentration of 30, 70, or 160 ppm D(5) or filtered air for 6h/day. Exposures for the F(0) and F(1) generations started at least 70 days prior to mating and lasted through weaning of the respective pups on postnatal day (PND) 21. Female exposures were interrupted from gestation day (GD) 21 through PND 4 to allow for parturition and to permit continuous maternal care for the early neonates. F(2) pups were not directly exposed to D(5). There were no exposure-related mortalities, clinical signs of toxicity, or effects on body weight or food consumption. There were no treatment-related gross findings or organ weight effects at the F(0) and F(1) necropsies. Other than minimal alveolar histiocytosis in all exposed groups, there were no noteworthy microscopic findings. Reproductive parameters (number of days between pairing and mating, mating and fertility indices, gestation length, and parturition), spermatogenic parameters and ovarian primordial follicle counts and numbers of corpora lutea in the F(0) and F(1) parental animals were not significantly changed between treated and control groups. Mean live litter sizes, number of pups born, sex ratios, pup body weights, postnatal pup survival and general physical condition of offspring in each generation were not affected. The slight, but statistically significant, increase in the mean F(1) male pup AGD in the 160 ppm group was not considered to be related to treatment. Vaginal patency and balanopreputial separation were unchanged compared to controls. Thus, the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for parental and reproductive toxicity was determined to be 160 ppm D(5).</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17175135&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schiff, William</author><author>Thayer, Stephen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cognitive and affective factors in temporal experiences: Judgments of intrinsically and extrinsically motivated successful and unsuccessful performances</title><secondary-title>Perceptual and Motor Skills</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Perceptual and Motor Skills</full-title><abbr-1>Perceptual and Motor Skills</abbr-1></periodical><pages>895-902</pages><volume>30</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Cognition</keyword><keyword>Emotions</keyword><keyword>Judgment</keyword><keyword>Motivation</keyword><keyword>motivation &amp; cognitive &amp; affective factors</keyword><keyword>temporal experience judgments</keyword><keyword>Time Perception</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1970</year><pub-dates><date>1970</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0031-5125</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2466/pms.1970.30.3.895</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Examined time judgments of 60 male undergraduates using verbal estimate and reproduction measures to determine whether the qualitative nature of an arousal state (success vs. failure) or arousal per se (task vs. control condition) influence estimates.

A recent population-based study in a south Indian district demonstrated that the official method used in India to estimate HIV burden in the population, which directly extrapolates annual sentinel surveillance data from large public sector antenatal and sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics, led to a 2-3 times higher estimate than that based on population-based data.; Methods: We assessed the generalisability of the reasons found in the Guntur study for overestimation of HIV by the official sentinel surveillance based method: addition of substantial unnecessary HIV estimates from STI clinics, the common practice of referral of HIV positive/suspect patients by private practitioners to public hospitals, and a preferential use of public hospitals by lower socioeconomic strata. We derived conservative correction factors for the sentinel surveillance data and titrated these to the four major HIV states in India (Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu), and examined the impact on the overall HIV estimate for India.; Results: HIV data from STI clinics are not used elsewhere in the world as a component of HIV burden estimation in generalised epidemics, and the Guntur study verified that this was unnecessary. The referral of HIV positive/suspect patients from the private to the public sector is a widespread phenomenon in India, which is likely causing an upward distortion in HIV estimates from sentinel surveillance in other parts of India as well. Analysis of data from the nationwide Reproductive and Child Health Survey revealed that lower socioeconomic strata were over-represented among women seeking antenatal care at public hospitals in all major south Indian states, similar to the trend seen in the Guntur study. Application of conservative correction factors derived from the Guntur study reduced the 2005 official sentinel surveillance based HIV estimate of 3.7 million 15-49 years old persons in the four major states to 1.5-2.0 million, which would drop the official total estimate of 5.2 million 15-49 years old persons with HIV in India to 3-3.5 million.; Conclusion: Plausible and cautious extrapolation of the trends seen in a recent large and rigorous population-based study of HIV in a south Indian district suggests that India is likely grossly overestimating its HIV burden with the current official sentinel surveillance based method. This method needs revision.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17181865&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gutermann, Anja</author><author>Mayer, Elfriede</author><author>von Dehn-Rothfelser, Karin</author><author>Breidenstein, Claudia</author><author>Weber, Mihaela</author><author>Muench, Martina</author><author>Gungor, Denis</author><author>Suehnel, Juergen</author><author>Moebius, Ulrich</author><author>Lechmann, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficacy of oncolytic herpesvirus NV1020 can be enhanced by combination with chemotherapeutics in colon carcinoma cells.</title><secondary-title>Human gene therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human gene therapy</full-title><abbr-1>Human gene therapy</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1241-1253</pages><volume>17</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Cell Line, Tumor</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms/*therapy</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms/pathology</keyword><keyword>Combined Modality Therapy</keyword><keyword>Fluorouracil/therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Genetic Therapy/*methods</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 1, Human/physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, Inbred BALB C</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1043-0342</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/hum.2006.17.1241</electronic-resource-num><abstract>NV1020, an oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1, can destroy colon cancer cells by selectively replicating within these cells, while sparing normal cells. NV1020 is currently under investigation in a clinical phase I/II trial as an agent for the treatment of colon cancer liver metastases, in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), SN38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), and oxaliplatin. To study the synergy of NV1020 and chemotherapy, cytotoxicity and viral replication were evaluated in vitro by treating various human and murine colon carcinoma cell lines, using a colorimetric viability assay, a clonogenic assay, and a plaque-forming assay. In vivo experiments, using a subcutaneous syngeneic CT-26 tumor model in BALB/c mice, were performed to determine the efficacy of combination therapy. In vitro studies showed that the efficacy of NV1020 on human colon carcinoma cell lines HT-29, WiDr, and HCT-116 was additively or synergistically enhanced in combination with 5-FU, SN38, or oxaliplatin. The sequence of application was not important and effects were still apparent after a 21-day incubation period. Three intra-tumoral treatments with NV1020 (1 x 10(7) plaque-forming units), followed by three subcutaneous treatments with 5-FU (50 mg/kg), resulted in substantially higher inhibition of tumor growth and prolongation of survival compared with monotherapies (NV1020/5-FU vs. NV1020, p = 0.027). On WiDr cells, reduced replication of NV1020, in combination with 5-FU, indicated that additive and synergistic effects of combination therapy must be independent from viral replication. These results suggest that NV1020, in combination with chemotherapy, is a promising therapy for treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer of the liver. We hypothesize that infection of cells with NV1020 sensitizes the infected cells for the cytotoxic effect of the chemotherapeutics.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17117895&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><titles><title>Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of a binary mixture of 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) (Cas No. 57465-28-8) and 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 118) (Cas No. 31508-00-6) in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (gavage studies).</title><secondary-title>National Toxicology Program technical report series</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>National Toxicology Program technical report series</full-title><abbr-1>National Toxicology Program technical report series</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1-218</pages><number>531</number><issue>531</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Liver/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Liver/enzymology</keyword><keyword>Lung/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Lung/enzymology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced</keyword><keyword>Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Polychlorinated Biphenyls/administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Rats, Sprague-Dawley</keyword><keyword>Thyroid Hormones/blood</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0888-8051</isbn><abstract>DIOXIN TOXIC EQUIVALENCY FACTOR EVALUATION OVERVIEW: Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have the ability to bind to and activate the ligand-activated transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Structurally related compounds that bind to the AhR and exhibit biological actions similar to TCDD are commonly referred to as "dioxin-like compounds" (DLCs). Ambient human exposure to DLCs occurs through the ingestion of foods containing residues of DLCs that bioconcentrate through the food chain. Due to their lipophilicity and persistence, once internalized they accumulate in body tissue, mainly adipose, resulting in chronic lifetime human exposure. Since human exposure to DLCs always occurs as a complex mixture, the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) methodology has been developed as a mathematical tool to assess the health risk posed by complex mixtures of these compounds. The TEF methodology is a relative potency scheme that ranks the dioxin-like activity of a compound relative to TCDD, which is the most potent congener. This allows for the estimation of the potential dioxin-like activity of a mixture of chemicals, based on a common mechanism of action involving an initial binding of DLCs to the AhR. The toxic equivalency of DLCs was nominated for evaluation because of the widespread human exposure to DLCs and the lack of data on the adequacy of the TEF methodology for predicting relative potency for cancer risk. To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. Mixtures of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) including 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) and 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 118) were produced commercially before 1977 for the electric industry as dielectric insulating fluids for transformers and capacitors. Manufacture and use of these chemicals were stopped because of increased PCB residues in the environment, but they continue to be released into the environment through the use and disposal of products containing PCBs, as by-products during the manufacture of certain organic chemicals, during combustion of some waste materials, and during atmospheric recycling. This PCB mixture study was conducted as part of the dioxin TEF evaluation that includes conducting multiple 2-year rat bioassays to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs, structurally related PCBs, and mixtures of these compounds. This study was originally a study of PCB 118 alone. However, midway through the study PCB 126 was identified as one of the minor contaminants (0.622%) of the bulk PCB 118 (98.5% pure). Given the 1,000-fold higher potency of PCB 126 for inducing dioxin-like effects (based on the TEFs for PCB 126 and PCB 118 of 0.1 and 0.0001, respectively), it was expected that the effects of administration of this compound would be due to the combined dioxin-like effects of both PCB 126 and PCB 118. Therefore, this study was reclassified as a mixture study of PCB 126 and PCB 118. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were administered the PCB mixture containing PCB 126 and PCB 118 by gavage in corn oil:acetone (99:1) or vehicle alone, 5 days per week for up to 104 weeks. Dose groups are referred to by the total levels of TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQ) provided by the PCBs in the mixture in each dose group. Groups of 81 female rats were administered 7, 22, 72, or 216 ng TEQ/kg; a group of 86 female rats was administered 360 ng TEQ/kg; and a group of 81 female rats was administered the corn oil:acetone vehicle alone. Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, or 53 weeks. No animals in the 360 ng TEQ/kg group were examined at 53 weeks. A group of 50 female rats was administered 360 ng TEQ/kg for 30 weeks and then the vehicle alone for the remainder of the study. Nominal doses of PCB 118 and levels of PCB 126 in each dose group used were: 7 ng TEQ/kg dose group: 62 ng/kg PCB 126 and 10 microg/kg PCB 118 7 ng TEQ/kg dose group: 62 ng/kg PCB 126 and 10 microg/kg PCB 118 22 ng TEQ/kg dose group: 187 ng/kg PCB 126 and 30 microg/kg PCB 118 72 ng TEQ/kg dose group: 622 ng/kg PCB 126 and 100 microg/kg PCB 118 216 ng TEQ/kg dose group: 1,866 ng/kg PCB 126 and 300 microg/kg PCB 118 360 ng TEQ/kg dose group: 3,110 ng/kg PCB 126 and 500 microg/kg PCB 118 No animals in the 216 or 360 ng TEQ/kg core study groups survived to the end of the study, and survival in the 360 ng TEQ/kg stop-exposure group was significantly less than in the vehicle control group. Mean body weights of 72 ng TEQ/kg rats were less than those of the vehicle controls after week 33 of the study, and mean body weights of the 216 and 360 ng TEQ/kg core study rats and the 360 ng TEQ/kg stop-exposure group rats were less than those of the vehicle controls throughout most of the study. Clinical findings related to the administration of the binary mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 118 included abnormal breathing, thinness, and ruffled hair. Thyroid Hormone Concentrations: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. Total thyroxine (T4) and free T4 were significantly lower in most dose groups than in vehicle controls at the 14- and 31-week interim evaluations. Serum T3 was significantly lower in the 360 ng TEQ/kg group compared to vehicle controls at 31 weeks only. TSH levels were higher in the 216 and 360 ng TEQ/kg groups than in vehicle controls at 31 weeks only. Hepatic Cell Proliferation Data To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was conducted at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. Labeling indices were elevated at doses above 216 ng TEQ/kg at 31 weeks and at doses above 72 ng TEQ/kg at 53 weeks. Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Activities: CYP1A1-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide-4-hydroxylase (A4H) activities were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations to evaluate the expression of known dioxin-responsive genes. In addition, CYP2B-associated pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (PROD) activity was also analyzed. Hepatic and pulmonary EROD (CYP1A1) activity, hepatic A4H (CYP1A2) activity, and hepatic PROD (CYP2B1) activity were significantly greater in all dosed groups compared to the vehicle controls at weeks 14, 31, and 53. Determinations of PCB 126 and PCB 118 Concentrations in Tissues: The tissue disposition of PCB 126 and PCB 118 was analyzed in the liver, lung, fat, and blood of up to 10 rats in each group at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations, except for the 360 ng TEQ/kg group at 53 weeks. The tissue disposition of PCB 126 and PCB 118 was also analyzed in 10 rats per group at the end of the 2-year study in the vehicle control, 7, 22, and 72 ng TEQ/kg core study groups and the 360 ng TEQ/kg stop-exposure group. Detectable concentrations of PCB 126 and PCB 118 were observed in the liver, fat, lung, and blood. The highest levels of PCB 126 were seen in the liver whereas the highest levels of PCB 118 were seen in the fat. In general, tissue concentrations increased with increasing doses of the mixture and increasing duration of exposure. Hepatic levels of PCB 126 and PCB 118 in the 72 ng TEQ/kg group at the end of the 2-year study were 284 ng/g and 3,769 ng/g, respectively. On a TCDD equivalents basis this corresponds to 28 ng TEQ/g and 0.4 ng TEQ/g for PCB 126 and PCB 118, respectively. Cessation of administration of the mixture in the stop-exposure group led to declines in the tissue concentrations of both PCB 126 and PCB 118 to levels comparable to those observed in the 7 ng TEQ/kg group at the end of the 2-year study. Pathology and Statistical Analyses: At 14, 31, and 53 weeks, liver weights were significantly increased in treated groups with more pronounced effects occurring in the higher dose groups. At 14 weeks, hepatocyte hypertrophy and pigmentation were seen at doses less than 72 ng TEQ/kg. Exposure to the PCB mixture led to significant toxicity in the liver. At higher doses, the incidences of toxic hepatopathy were increased as indicated by increased incidences of multinucleated hepatocytes and diffuse fatty change. At 31 weeks, most rats in the 216 and 360 ng TEQ/kg groups had multiple hepatic nonneoplastic lesions. At 53 weeks all animals administered 216 ng TEQ/kg had multiple nonneoplastic lesions. The spectrum of effects and the severity of effects at the interim and 2-year time points increased with dose and duration of exposure. At the end of the 2-year study in all dosed groups, there were significantly increased incidences and severity of toxic hepatopathy characterized by hepatocyte hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, pigmentation, toxic hepatopathy, diffuse fatty change, nodular hyperplasia, centrilobular fibrosis, cholangiofibrosis, oval cell hyperplasia, bile duct cyst, bile duct hyperplasia, and portal fibrosis. There were also increased incidences of hepatocyte glandular structures, necrosis, centrilobular degeneration, eosinophilic focus, and metaplasia. The incidences of cholangiocarcinoma (multiple and/or single) were significantly increased in groups administered 22 ng TEQ/kg or greater at 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma were also significantly increased in the 216 and 360 ng TEQ/kg core study groups. In addition, single occurrences of hepatocholangioma, cholangioma, or hepatocellular carcinoma were observed in some dosed groups administered 72 ng TEQ/kg or greater. In the lung at 53 weeks, the incidences of cystic keratinizing epithelioma and bronchiolar metaplasia were significantly increased in the 216 ng TEQ/kg group.

To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. 2,3,4,7,8-Pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is not manufactured commercially other than for scientific research purposes. The main sources of PeCDF releases into the environment are from combustion and incineration sources. PeCDF was selected for study by the National Toxicology Program as a part of the dioxin TEF evaluation to assess the cancer risk posed by complex mixtures of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and PCBs. The dioxin TEF evaluation includes conducting multiple 2-year rat bioassays to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs, structurally related PCBs, and mixtures of these compounds. While one of the aims of the dioxin TEF evaluation was a comparative analysis across studies, in this Technical Report only the results of the present PeCDF study are presented and discussed. Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were administered PeCDF (at least 97% pure) in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 14, 31, or 53 weeks or 2 years. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of 81 female rats were administered 6, 20, 44, 92, or 200 ng PeCDF/kg body weight in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage, 5 days per week, for up to 105 weeks; a group of 81 vehicle control female rats received the corn oil/acetone vehicle alone. Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. A stop-exposure group was administered 200 ng/kg PeCDF in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 30 weeks and then the vehicle for the remainder of the study. The PeCDF in this study was at least 97% pure. Survival of dosed groups was similar to that of the vehicle control group. Mean body weights of the 200 ng/kg core and stop-exposure groups were less than those of the vehicle controls during year 2 of the study. Thyroid Hormone Concentrations: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels were evaluated at the 14-, 31- and 53-week interim evaluations. There were significant decreases in total serum thyroxine (T(4)) levels at the 14-week interim evaluation. There were no significant differences observed in serum free T(4), total triiodothyronine (T(3)), or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) at 14 weeks. At both 31 and 53 weeks, there were treatment-related decreases in free and total T(4) concentrations and increases in serum T(3) levels. Serum TSH levels in dosed groups at 31 and 53 weeks were not significantly different than in the vehicle controls. Hepatic Cell Proliferation Data: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was conducted at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. At 14 and 53 weeks, hepatocyte BrdU-labeling indices were significantly higher in the 200 ng/kg groups compared to time-matched vehicle controls. No significant differences were observed between the dosed groups and vehicle controls at 31 weeks. Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Activities: To evaluate the expression of known dioxin-responsive genes, CYP1A1-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide-4-hydroxylase (A4H) activity were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. Hepatic EROD and A4H activities were significantly higher in all groups administered PeCDF relative to the vehicle controls at all three interim evaluations. Pulmonary EROD was also significantly higher in all dosed groups compared to vehicle controls at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. Determinations of PeCDF Concentrations in Tissues: The tissue disposition of PeCDF was analyzed in the liver, lung, fat, and blood of all animals at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations, and in 10 animals per group at the end of the 2-year study (105 weeks). In the liver of vehicle controls, PeCDF concentrations were detectable at 105 weeks. Measurable concentrations of PeCDF were not detected in fat or lung from vehicle control rats at any of the interim evaluations or at 105 weeks. Hepatic and fat concentrations were higher in groups with increasing doses of PeCDF, demonstrating a dose-related increase in tissue burden of PeCDF at each time point. No measurable concentrations of PeCDF were detected in the lungs of vehicle controls or any of the dosed groups at 14 weeks or in the lungs of the vehicle control group at 31, 53, and 105 weeks, or the 6 ng/kg group at 31 and 53 weeks. In groups with measurable levels, PeCDF concentrations were higher with respect to increasing doses. Mean levels of PeCDF in the liver, fat, lung, and blood in the 200 ng/kg group at the end of the 2-year study were 500 ng/g, 7.75 ng/g, 0.28 ng/g and 0.04 ng/mL, respectively. Negligible PeCDF concentrations were observed in blood of the 200 ng/kg group at 53 weeks and the 92 and 200 ng/kg groups at 105 weeks. In liver and fat from the stop-exposure group, the PeCDF concentrations were between the levels observed in the 6 and 20 ng/kg groups. In the stop-exposure group, PeCDF concentration in lung was comparable to levels observed in the 6 ng/kg group. No measurable concentrations were observed in blood from the stop-exposure group. Pathology and Statistical Analyses: There were dose-dependent increases in both absolute and relative liver weights at 4, 31, and 53 weeks, and these tended to correlate with increased incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. In the liver at 14 weeks, the only significant effect was an increase in the incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. At 53 weeks, there were significant increases in the incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy and pigmentation. At 2 years, there were significant dose-dependent trends for increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and cholangiocarcinoma of the liver. A significant dose-dependent increase in hepatic toxicity was observed and was characterized by increased incidences of numerous nonneoplastic lesions including hepatocellular hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, oval cell hyperplasia, diffuse fatty change, pigmentation, nodular hyperplasia, eosinophilic foci, hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia, bile duct fibrosis, cholangiofibrosis, and toxic hepatopathy. At 2 years, three gingival squamous cell carcinomas of the oral mucosa were seen in the 200 ng/kg core and stop-exposure groups, two occurred in the 6 ng/kg group, and one occurred in each of the vehicle control, 20 ng/kg, and 92 ng/kg groups. Gingival squamous hyperplasia occurred in all groups including the vehicle controls, with increasing incidences in groups administered 44 ng/kg or greater. The incidence of carcinoma of the uterus was marginally increased in the 92 ng/kg group at 2 years. Increased incidences of chronic active inflammation of the uterus were observed in all dosed groups, and the incidence in the 200 ng/kg stop-exposure group was greater than those in the vehicle control and 200 ng/kg core study groups. Increased incidences of squamous metaplasia of the uterus occurred in all dosed groups. In the 200 ng/kg stop-exposure group, the incidence of squamous metaplasia was significantly greater than that in the vehicle controls, but was lower than that in the 200 ng/kg core study group. At 14-weeks, lung weights were significantly increased in the 200 ng/kg group compared to the vehicle controls. A single occurrence of a multiple cystic keratinizing epithelioma of the lung was observed in the 200 ng/kg core study group. There were increases in the incidences of bronchiolar metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium and sporadic incidences of squamous metaplasia. One pancreatic acinar adenoma and one pancreatic acinar carcinoma were each observed in the 92 ng/kg group and in the 200 ng/kg stop-exposure group at 2 years. Significantly increased incidences of acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization and arterial chronic active inflammation and increased severity of chronic active inflammation were observed in the 200 ng/kg core study group. Numerous nonneoplastic effects were seen in other organs including thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy, thymic atrophy, adrenal cortex cystic degeneration, nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, and squamous hyperplasia of the forestomach.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17160103&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><titles><title>Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of a mixture of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (Cas No. 1746-01-6), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) (Cas No. 57117-31-4), and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) (Cas No. 57465-28-8) in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (gavage studies).</title><secondary-title>National Toxicology Program technical report series</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>National Toxicology Program technical report series</full-title><abbr-1>National Toxicology Program technical report series</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1-180</pages><number>526</number><issue>526</issue><keywords><keyword>Administration, Oral</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Benzofurans/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Benzofurans/administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens/administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Polychlorinated Biphenyls/administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Rats, Sprague-Dawley</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0888-8051</isbn><abstract>DIOXIN TOXIC EQUIVALENCY FACTOR EVALUATION OVERVIEW: Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have the ability to bind to and activate the ligand-activated transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Structurally related compounds that bind to the AhR and exhibit biological actions similar to TCDD are commonly referred to as "dioxin-like compounds" (DLCs). Ambient human exposure to DLCs occurs through the ingestion of foods containing residues of DLCs that bioconcentrate through the food chain. Due to their lipophilicity and persistence, once internalized, they accumulate in body tissues, mainly adipose, resulting in chronic lifetime human exposure. Since human exposure to DLCs always involves a complex mixture, the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) methodology has been developed as a mathematical tool to assess the health risk posed by complex mixtures of these compounds. The TEF methodology is a relative potency scheme that ranks the dioxin-like activity of a compound relative to TCDD, which is the most potent congener. This allows for the estimation of the potential dioxin-like activity of a mixture of chemicals, based on a common mechanism of action involving an initial binding of DLCs to the AhR. The toxic equivalency of DLCs was nominated for evaluation because of the widespread human exposure to DLCs and the lack of data on the adequacy of the TEF methodology for predicting relative potency for cancer risk. To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF), and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) are not manufactured commercially other than for scientific research purposes. The main sources of TCDD and PeCDF releases into the environment are from metal smelting, refining, and processing; combustion and incineration sources; chemical manufacturing and processing; biological and photochemical processes; and existing reservior sources that reflect past releases. PCB mixtures were commercially produced and used in the electric power industry as dielectric insulating fluids in transformers and capacitors and used in hydraulic fluids, plastics, and paints. TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 were selected for study by the National Toxicology Program as part of the dioxin TEF evaluation to assess the cancer risk posed by complex mixtures of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and PCBs. The dioxin TEF evaluation includes conducting multiple 2-year rat bioassays to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLC's, structurally related PCBs, and mixtures of these compounds. Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a mixture of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 (henceforth referred to as the TEF mixture) in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 14, 31, or 53 weeks or 2 years. While one of the aims of the dioxin TEF evaluation was a comparative analysis across studies, in this Technical Report only the results of the present study of the mixture of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 are presented and discussed. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of 81 female rats were administered 10, 22, 46, or 100 ng toxic equivalents (TEQ)/kg body weight in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage, 5 days per week, for up to 105 weeks; a group of 81 vehicle control female rats received the corn oil/acetone vehicle alone. Actual doses used for each compound in the mixture were: for 10 ng TEQ/kg: 3.3 ng/kg TCDD, 6.6 ng/kg PeCDF, and 33.3 ng/kg PCB 126; for 22 ng TEQ/kg: 7.3 ng/kg TCDD, 14.5 ng/kg PeCDF, and 73.3 ng/kg PCB 126; for 46 ng TEQ/kg: 15.2 ng/kg TCDD, 30.4 ng/kg PeCDF, and 153 ng/kg PCB 126; and for 100 ng TEQ/kg: 33 ng/kg TCDD, 66 ng/kg PeCDF, and 333 ng/kg PCB 126. Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, or 53 weeks. Survival of all dosed groups of rats was similar to that of the vehicle control group. Mean body weights of the 22 and 46 ng TEQ/kg groups were less than those of the vehicle control groups after week 69 of the study. Mean body weights of the 100 ng TEQ/kg group were less than those of the vehicle control group after week 37 of the study. Thyroid Hormone Concentrations: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone concentrations were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. At 14, 31, and 53 weeks, there were dose-dependent reductions in total serum and free thyroxine concentrations. There were dose-dependent increases in serum triiodothyronine concentrations at 14 and 31 weeks. No changes in serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations were observed at any time point. Hepatic Cell Proliferation Data: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was conducted at the interim evaluations. At 14 weeks, no effects on the hepatocellular labeling index were observed in the dosed groups compared to the vehicle controls. At 31 and 53 weeks, the hepatocellular labeling index was significantly higher in the 46 and 100 ng TEQ/kg groups compared to the vehicle controls. Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Activities: To evaluate the expression of known dioxin-responsive genes, CYP1A1-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide-4-hydroxylase (A4H) activity were evaluated at the interim time points. Liver and lung EROD (CYP1A1) activities and hepatic A4H (CYP1A2) activities were significantly greater in all dosed groups than in the vehicle controls at all interim evaluations (14, 31, and 53 weeks). Determinations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 Concentrations in Tissues: Tissue concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 were analyzed in the fat, liver, lung, and blood at each interim evaluation and at the end of the 2-year study (105 weeks). The highest concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 were observed in the liver followed by fat. Liver and fat concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 at each interim evaluation and at 105 weeks were higher in groups with increasing doses of the mixture and generally increased with duration of dosing. In the lung, PeCDF was present at detectable concentrations in the 46 and 100 ng TEQ/kg groups at 14 and 31 weeks. Measurable concentrations of TCDD and PCB 126 were observed at 14 and 31 weeks in the lung of rats in all dosed groups with the highest concentrations observed in the 100 ng TEQ/kg group. At 53 weeks, concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 in the lung generally increased with increasing dose. At 105 weeks, detectable concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 in the lung were observed in all dosed groups. In blood, TCDD and PCB 126 concentrations at 14 and 31 weeks generally increased with increasing dose. Blood concentrations of PeCDF were detectable in the 46 and 100 ng TEQ/kg groups at 14 weeks and at 22 ng TEQ/kg or greater at 31 weeks. At 53 and 105 weeks, concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 in blood generally increased with increasing dose and duration of dosing. Pathology and Statistical Analyses: Relative liver weights were significantly increased in all dosed groups at 14, 31, and 53 weeks and correlated with increased incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. Increasing duration of exposure led to an increase in the spectrum, incidence, and severity of nonneoplastic effects. The only significant effect at 14 weeks was increased incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. At 53 weeks, there was a significant effect on the incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, pigmentation, focal fatty change, bile duct hyperplasia, and toxic hepatopathy. At 2 years, there were significant increases in the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and cholangiocarcinoma of the liver. There was an increase in hepatic toxicity characterized by increases in the incidences of numerous nonneoplastic lesions including hepatocyte hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, pigmentation, inflammation, diffuse fatty change, bile duct hyperplasia, oval cell hyperplasia, nodular hyperplasia, eosinophilic focus, cholangiofibrosis, bile duct cysts, necrosis, portal fibrosis, mixed cell focus, and toxic hepatopathy. In the lung, there were dose-dependent increases in the incidences of bronchiolar metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium at 53 weeks and at 2 years and squamous metaplasia at 2 years. At 2 years, there was a dose-dependent increase in the incidences of cystic keratinizing epithelioma. In the pancreas, there were increases in the incidences of numerous nonneoplastic lesions including arterial chronic active inflammation, acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization, acinar atrophy, chronic active inflammation, and duct dilatation. At 2 years, incidences of acinar adenoma or acinar carcinoma that exceeded the historical control ranges were seen in all dosed groups except the 100 ng TEQ/kg group. Treatment-related increases in the incidences of nonneoplastic lesions were seen in other organs including hyperplasia, cystic degeneration, atrophy, and cytoplasmic vacuolization of the adrenal cortex; gingival squamous hyperplasia of the oral mucosa; squamous metaplasia of the uterus; atrophy of the thymus (incidence and severity); chronic active inflammation of the ovary; nephropathy of the kidney (incidence and severity); cardiomyopathy; bone marrow hyperplasia; transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder; chronic active inflammation of the mesenteric artery; and follicular cell hypertrophy of the thyroid gland.

The methodology is applied to a new data set of microarray gene expression data collected in Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, Foggia--Italy. The data set is made up of normal (22) and tumor (25) specimens extracted from 25 patients affected by colon cancer. We propose to give answers to some questions which are relevant for the automatic diagnosis of cancer such as: Is the size of the available data set sufficient to build accurate classifiers? What is the statistical significance of the associated error rates? In what ways can accuracy be considered dependant on the adopted classification scheme? How many genes are correlated with the pathology and how many are sufficient for an accurate colon cancer classification? The method we propose answers these questions whilst avoiding the potential pitfalls hidden in the analysis and interpretation of microarray data.; Results: We estimate the generalization error, evaluated through the Leave-K-Out Cross Validation error, for three different classification schemes by varying the number of training examples and the number of the genes used. The statistical significance of the error rate is measured by using a permutation test. We provide a statistical analysis in terms of the frequencies of the genes involved in the classification. Using the whole set of genes, we found that the Weighted Voting Algorithm (WVA) classifier learns the distinction between normal and tumor specimens with 25 training examples, providing e = 21% (p = 0.045) as an error rate. This remains constant even when the number of examples increases. Moreover, Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers can learn with only 15 training examples, with an error rate of e = 19% (p = 0.035) and e = 18% (p = 0.037) respectively. Moreover, the error rate decreases as the training set size increases, reaching its best performances with 35 training examples. In this case, RLS and SVM have error rates of e = 14% (p = 0.027) and e = 11% (p = 0.019). Concerning the number of genes, we found about 6000 genes (p &lt; 0.05) correlated with the pathology, resulting from the signal-to-noise statistic. Moreover the performances of RLS and SVM classifiers do not change when 74% of genes is used. They progressively reduce up to e = 16% (p &lt; 0.05) when only 2 genes are employed. The biological relevance of a set of genes determined by our statistical analysis and the major roles they play in colorectal tumorigenesis is discussed.; Conclusions: The method proposed provides statistically significant answers to precise questions relevant for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. We found that, with as few as 15 examples, it is possible to train statistically significant classifiers for colon cancer diagnosis. As for the definition of the number of genes sufficient for a reliable classification of colon cancer, our results suggest that it depends on the accuracy required.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=16919171&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><titles><title>Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of a binary mixture of 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) (Cas No. 57465-28-8) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153) (CAS No. 35065-27-1) in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (gavage studies).</title><secondary-title>National Toxicology Program technical report series</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>National Toxicology Program technical report series</full-title><abbr-1>National Toxicology Program technical report series</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1-258</pages><number>530</number><issue>530</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Rats, Sprague-Dawley</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0888-8051</isbn><abstract>DIOXIN TOXIC EQUIVALENCY FACTOR EVALUATION OVERVIEW: Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have the ability to bind to and activate the ligand-activated transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).

To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. 2-YEAR STUDY: The 2-year study of a binary mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153 was designed to assess the carcinogenicity of a constant ratio mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153. In addition, varying ratio mixture groups were used to assess the impact of increasing PCB 153 on the carcinogenicity of PCB 126. Dose groups were divided into two study arms (Figure 1). TCDD equivalent (TEQ) doses are based on the PCB 126 doses after adjustment for the PCB 126 TEF of 0.1. Groups of 81 (Groups 2, 3, 5, and 7) or 80 (Groups 4 and 6) female rats received a mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153 in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage 5 days per week for up to 105 weeks; a group of 81 female rats received the corn oil:acetone (99:1) vehicle only and served as the vehicle control (Group 1). Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. Survival of all dosed groups was similar to that of the vehicle controls. The mean body weights of Groups 4 and 5 were generally less than those of the vehicle controls after week 25. The mean body weights of Group 6 were less after week 12, and those of Group 7 were less after week 8. Thyroid Hormone Concentrations: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. In the constant ratio groups, serum total thyroxine (T(4)) and free T(4) generally showed a treatment-related decrease relative to controls. Serum total triiodothyronine (T(3)) exhibited a treatment-related increase at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations, but serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were increased at the 14-week time point only. In the varying ratio groups, the decrease in total and free T(4) was more pronounced in those groups dosed with the increasing proportion of PCB 153 at the 31- and 53-week time points. Hepatic Cell Proliferation Data: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was conducted at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. At 31 and 53 weeks, a significant increase in the hepatocellular labeling index occurred in Group 7. In the varying ratio groups, the labeling index at the 53-week interim time point was significantly higher in Group 6, which had the highest proportion of PCB 153 compared to the other varying ratio groups. Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Activities: To evaluate the expression of known PCB 126-responsive genes, CYP1A1-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide-4-hydroxylase (A4H) activities were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. In addition, PCB 153-inducible CYP2B-associated 7-pent-oxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) activity was analyzed. In the constant ratio Groups 2, 3, 5, and 7, hepatic and pulmonary EROD (CYP1A1) activities, hepatic A4H (CYP1A2) activities, and hepatic PROD (CYP2B) activities were significantly greater in all dosed groups compared to the vehicle controls at weeks 14, 31, and 53. In the varying ratio groups, hepatic EROD, A4H, and PROD activities at 14 weeks were higher in groups receiving a greater proportion of PCB 153 in the PCB mixture. At 31 and 53 weeks, hepatic CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 enzyme activities in Group 6 were generally lower than in Groups 4 and 5. Determinations of PCB 126 and PCB 153 Concentrations in Tissues: Concentrations of PCB 126 and PCB 153 were determined in fat, liver, lung, and blood at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations and at the end of the 2-year study (105 weeks). PCB 126 was not detectable in vehicle control animals, but increased with increasing dose of PCB 126 and duration of exposure; the highest concentrations were found in liver and fat, and lower levels were seen in lung and blood. Increasing the proportion of PCB 153 in the mixture relative to PCB 126 led to a general decrease in the amount of PCB 126 in liver and lung at the later time points, whereas in fat and blood, there was generally either no effect of PCB 153 on the disposition of PCB 126, or there was an increase in the amount of PCB 126 in the tissue. In vehicle control animals, PCB 153 was detectable in the fat at all time points, in the lung at all time points except 53 weeks, and in the liver and blood at 2 years. PCB 153 was measurable in all examined tissues of treated animals, with the highest concentrations found in fat at the end of the 2-year study in groups administered the highest doses of PCB 153. Pathology and Statistical Analyses -- Constant Ratio Mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153: At 14, 31, and 53 weeks, the absolute and relative liver weights of all dosed groups were generally greater than those of the vehicle controls. Exposure to the PCB mixture led to significant toxicity in the liver. At 14 weeks, the incidences of several nonneoplastic liver lesions were increased compared to the vehicle controls including hepatocyte hypertrophy, pigmentation, multinucleated hepatocytes, and diffuse fatty change. The spectrum and severity of effects increased with dose and duration of exposure. At the end of the 2-year study, there were significantly increased incidences and severities of toxic hepatopathy characterized by hepatocyte hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, pigmentation, diffuse and focal fatty change, eosinophilic focus, nodular hyperplasia, cholangiofibrosis, oval cell hyperplasia, bile duct cysts, bile duct hyperplasia, necrosis, and portal fibrosis. Significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatocholangioma were observed in the study. In addition, two animals in the highest dose group had hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidences of these lesions generally exceeded the historical vehicle control ranges. At 2 years, a significantly increased incidence of cystic keratinizing epithelioma of the lung was observed in Group 7. In addition, single occurrences of squamous cell carcinoma were seen in the top two dose groups. Nonneoplastic effects whose incidences were increased in the lung included bronchiolar metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium and squamous metaplasia. Significantly increased incidences of squamous cell carcinoma (gingival) of the oral mucosa were seen at the end of the 2-year study and were accompanied by increased incidences of gingival squamous hyperplasia. In the pancreas at 53 weeks, the incidence of acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization was significantly increased in the highest dose group. At 2 years, increased incidences of acinar atrophy and acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization were seen in addition to pancreatic acinar neoplasms in dosed groups. In Groups 5 and 7, these incidences exceeded the historical vehicle control ranges. In the uterus at 2 years, there was a marginal increase in the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma in Group 5. Numerous nonneoplastic effects were seen in other organs at the interim time points including atrophy of the thymus and follicular cell hypertrophy of the thyroid gland. These responses were also affected by administration of the mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153 at the end of the 2-year study and were accompanied by additional nonneoplastic responses in numerous organs including atrophy of the adrenal cortex and cortical hyperplasia, severity of nephropathy, and incidences of pigmentation of the kidney. Other nonneoplastic lesions that were treatment related were forestomach hyperplasia, hyperplasia of the nasal respiratory epithelium, metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium, and ectasia of the mandibular lymph node. Varying Ratio Mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153: An effect of increasing the proportion of PCB 153 in the PCB mixture was seen in several tissues, most notably in the liver. Treatment-related nonneoplastic effects seen across the varying ratio groups were generally the same as those seen in the constant ratio groups. In general there was a positive effect of PCB 153 in the mixture on the incidences and severities of these lesions with higher incidences and higher severities being seen in Group 6, which had the highest proportion of PCB 153.

Similarly, while pollination biologists have stressed the utility of pollinator importance, incorporating both pollinator abundance and effectiveness, importance values have not been included in estimates of generalization in pollination systems. In this study, we estimated pollinator generalization for 17 plant species using Simpson's diversity index, which includes richness and evenness. We compared these estimates with estimates based on only pollinator richness, and compared diversity estimates calculated using importance data with those using only visitation data. We found that pollinator richness explains only 57-65% of the variation in diversity, and that, for most plant species, pollinator importance was determined primarily by differences in visitation rather than by differences in effectiveness. While simple richness may suffice for broad comparisons of pollinator generalization, measures that incorporate evenness will provide a much more accurate understanding of generalization. Although incorporating labor-intensive measurements of pollinator effectiveness are less necessary for broad surveys, effectiveness estimates will be important for detailed studies of some plant species. Unfortunately, at this point it is impossible to predict a priori which species these are.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=16514533&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hanson, George R</author><author>Suggs, Jeremy F</author><author>Freiberg, Andrew A</author><author>Durbhakula, Sridar</author><author>Li, Guoan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigation of in vivo 6DOF total knee arthoplasty kinematics using a dual orthogonal fluoroscopic system.</title><secondary-title>Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society</abbr-1></periodical><pages>974-981</pages><volume>24</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee*</keyword><keyword>Biomechanical Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Fluoroscopy</keyword><keyword>Knee Joint/*physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Range of Motion, Articular</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0736-0266</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jor.20141</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fluoroscopic techniques have been recently used to detect in vivo knee joint kinematics. This article presents a technique that uses two fluoroscopes to form a dual orthogonal fluoroscopic system for accurately measuring in vivo 6DOF total knee arthoplasty (TKA) kinematics. The system was rigorously validated and used to investigate in vivo kinematics of 12 patients after cruciate-retaining TKA. In a repeatability study, the pose of two different TKA components was reproduced with standard deviations (SD) of 0.17 mm and 0.57 degrees about all three axes. In an accuracy study, the reproduced component positions were compared to the known component positions. Position and rotation mean errors were all within 0.11 mm and 0.24 degrees, with SD within 0.11 mm and 0.48 degrees, respectively. The results of this study show that the matching process of the imaging system is able to accurately reproduce the spatial positions and orientations of both the femoral and tibial components. For CR TKA patients, a consistent anterior femoral translation was observed with flexion through 45 degrees of flexion, and thereafter, the femur translated posteriorly with further flexion. The medial-lateral translation was measured to be less than 2 mm throughout the entire flexion range. Internal tibial rotation steadily increased through maximum flexion by approximately 6 degrees. Varus rotation was also measured with flexion but had a mean magnitude less than 2.0 degrees. In conclusion, the dual orthogonal fluoroscopic system accurately detects TKA kinematics and is applicable towards other joints of the musculoskeletal system, including the wrist, elbow, shoulder, ankle, and spine.

Sensitivity for malignant disease is generally around 50% and specificity around 100%. The present study was designed to assess the reproducibility of the cytological examination.; Material and Methods: Samples were obtained from 55 consecutive patients with biliary duct strictures that eventually turned out to be caused by malignant disease in 41 patients (73%). The cytology specimens were evaluated twice in different random order with an interval of at least 4 months by two pathologists blinded to the final diagnoses. Suitability for diagnosis (suitable, suboptimal or unsuitable) and cytologic diagnosis (benign, atypical, suspicious for malignancy and malignant cells) were registered. Kappa analysis was applied.; Results: Regarding suitability for diagnosis, the two observers reproduced their findings in 84% (kappa 0.76) and 87% (0.59) (p&gt;0.05), while the interobserver variations on the two occasions were 76% and 78% (kappa 0.49 and 0.58, respectively) (p&gt;0.05). Five percent of samples were rated as inadequate for diagnosis in at least one reading; 18% were suboptimal and 62-82% were suitable. The observers reproduced their cytological diagnosis in 77% and 71% (weighted kappa 0.83 and 0.75) (p&gt;0.05), and agreed on the cytological diagnosis in 65% and 73% (weighted kappa 0.65 and 0.75) (p&gt;0.05).; Conclusions: The intra- and interobserver agreement in cytological evaluation of endobiliary brushings from bile duct strictures is generally good. The rates of inadequate and suboptimal samples can probably be reduced by modifications of the brush design.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=16638704&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pina-Neto, J M</author><author>Carrara, R C V</author><author>Bisinella, R</author><author>Mazzucatto, L F</author><author>Martins, M D</author><author>Sartoratto, E</author><author>Yamasaki, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Somatic cytogenetic and azoospermia factor gene microdeletion studies in infertile men.</title><secondary-title>Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas</full-title><abbr-1>Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas</abbr-1></periodical><pages>555-561</pages><volume>39</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Chromosome Deletion*</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes, Human, Y/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Gene Deletion*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infertility, Male/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Karyotyping</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Oligospermia/genetics</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0100-879X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/s0100-879x2006000400017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of somatic chromosomal anomalies and Y chromosomal microdeletions (azoospermia factor genes, AZF) in infertile males who seek assisted reproduction. These studies are very important because the assisted reproduction techniques (mainly intracytoplasmic sperm injection) bypass the natural selection process and some classical chromosomal abnormalities, microdeletions of AZF genes or some deleterious genic mutations could pass through generations. These genetic abnormalities can cause in the offspring of these patients male infertility, ambiguous external genitalia, mental retardation, and other birth defects. We studied 165 infertile men whose infertility was attributable to testicular problems (60 were azoospermic, 100 were oligospermic and 5 were asthenospermic). We studied 100 metaphases per patient with GTG banding obtained from temporary lymphocyte culture for chromosomal abnormality detection and performed a genomic DNA analysis using 28 Y chromosome-specific sequence-tagged sites for Y AZF microdeletion detection. Karyotyping revealed somatic anomalies in 16 subjects (16/165 = 9.6%). Of these 16, 12 were in the azoospermic group (12/60 = 20%) and 4 were in the oligospermic group (4/100 = 4%). The most common chromosomal anomaly was Klinefelter syndrome (10/165 = 6%). Microdeletions of AZF genes were detected in 12 subjects (12/160 = 7.5%). The frequencies detected are similar to those described previously. These results show the importance of genetic evaluation of infertile males prior to assisted reproduction. Such evaluation can lead to genetic counseling and, consequently, to primary and secondary prevention of mental retardation and birth defects.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=16612480&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><titles><title>NTP technical report on the toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (CAS No. 1746-01-6) in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Gavage Studies).</title><secondary-title>National Toxicology Program technical report series</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>National Toxicology Program technical report series</full-title><abbr-1>National Toxicology Program technical report series</abbr-1></periodical><pages>4-232</pages><number>521</number><issue>521</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Weight/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Carcinogenicity Tests</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens/administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens/pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced</keyword><keyword>Organ Size/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Rats, Sprague-Dawley</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0888-8051</isbn><abstract>DIOXIN TOXIC EQUIVALENCY FACTOR EVALUATION OVERVIEW: Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have the ability to bind to and activate the ligand-activated transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Structurally related compounds that bind to the AhR and exhibit biological actions similar to TCDD are commonly referred to as "dioxin-like compounds" (DLCs). Ambient human exposure to DLCs occurs through the ingestion of foods containing residues of DLCs that bioconcentrate through the food chain. Due to their lipophilicity and persistence, once internalized, they accumulate in body tissue, mainly adipose, resulting in chronic lifetime human exposure. Since human exposure to DLCs always involves a complex mixture, the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) methodology has been developed as a mathematical tool to assess the health risk posed by complex mixtures of these compounds. The TEF methodology is a relative potency scheme that ranks the dioxin-like activity of a compound relative to TCDD, which is the most potent congener. This allows for the estimation of the potential dioxin-like activity of a mixture of chemicals based on a common mechanism of action involving an initial binding of DLCs to the AhR. The toxic equivalency of DLCs was nominated for evaluation because of the widespread human exposure to DLCs and the lack of data on the adequacy of the TEF methodology for predicting relative potency for cancer risk. To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. TCDD is not manufactured commercially other than for scientific research purposes. The main sources of TCDD releases into the environment are from combustion and incineration; metal smelting, refining, and processing; chemical manufacturing and processing; biological and photochemical processes; and existing reservoir sources that reflect past releases. TCDD (dioxin) was selected for study by the National Toxicology Program as a part of the dioxin TEF evaluation to assess the cancer risk posed by complex mixtures of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and PCBs. The dioxin TEF evaluation includes conducting multiple 2-year rat bioassays to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs, structurally related PCBs, and mixtures of these compounds. While one of the aims of the dioxin TEF evaluation was a comparative analysis across studies, in this Technical Report, only the TCDD results are presented and discussed. TCDD was included because it is the reference compound for the dioxin TEF methodology. Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were administered TCDD (at least 98% pure) in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 14, 31, or 53 weeks or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse bone marrow cells. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of 81 or 82 female rats were administered 3, 10, 22, 46, or 100 ng TCDD/kg body weight in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage, 5 days per week, for up to 105 weeks; a group of 81 vehicle control female rats received the corn oil/acetone vehicle alone. Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, or 53 weeks. A stop-exposure group of 50 female rats was administered 100 ng/kg TCDD in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 30 weeks and then just the vehicle for the remainder of the study. Survival of dosed groups was similar to that of the vehicle control group. Mean body weights of 100 ng/kg core study and stop-exposure groups were less than those of the vehicle control group after week 13 of the study. Mean body weights of 46 ng/kg rats were less than those of the vehicle controls during year 2 of the study, and those of 22 ng/kg rats were less than those of the vehicle controls the last 10 weeks of the study. THYROID HORMONE CONCENTRATIONS: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels were evaluated at the 14-, 31- and 53-week interim evaluations. At 14 weeks, there were significant decreases in serum total and free thyroxine (T4) levels and increases in serum total triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). At 31 weeks, there were significant decreases in serum total and free T4 levels and increases in serum total T3 but no significant effect on TSH. At 53 weeks, there were significant decreases in serum total T4 levels and increases in serum total T3. There were no significant effects on total T4 or TSH levels. HEPATIC CELL PROLIFERATION DATA: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was conducted at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. The hepatocellular labeling index was significantly higher in the 22 ng/kg group compared to vehicle controls at 14 weeks. At the 31-week interim evaluation, the labeling indices in hepatocytes were significantly higher in all dosed groups than in the vehicle controls. At 53 weeks, labeling indices were significantly higher in the 46 and 100 ng/kg groups than in the vehicle controls. CYTOCHROME P450 ENZYME ACTIVITIES: To evaluate the expression of known dioxin-responsive genes, CYP1A1-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide-4-hydroxylase (A4H) activity were evaluated at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. In addition, pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (PROD) activity was analyzed. Hepatic EROD, PROD, and A4H activities were significantly higher in all dosed groups relative to vehicle controls at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. Pulmonary EROD was also significantly higher in all dosed groups compared to vehicle controls at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. DETERMINATIONS OF TCDD CONCENTRATIONS IN TISSUES: The tissue disposition of TCDD was analyzed in the liver, lung, fat, and blood of all animals in each group at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations and in 10 animals per group at the end of the 2-year study (105 weeks). The highest concentrations of TCDD were observed in the liver, followed by fat tissue. Liver and fat tissue concentrations of TCDD increased with increasing doses of TCDD. No measurable concentrations of TCDD were observed in blood from vehicle control or treated rats at any of the interim evaluations. Mean levels of TCDD in the liver and fat in the 100 ng/kg group at the end of the 2-year study were 9.3 and 3.2 ng/g, respectively. In liver tissue from the stop-exposure group, TCDD concentrations were slightly higher than those observed in the 3 ng/kg group. In the stop-exposure group, TCDD concentrations in fat were below the limits of quantitation. PATHOLOGY AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Absolute and/or relative liver weights were increased at 14, 31, and 53 weeks, with more severe effects occurring in the higher dosed groups. Increased liver weights correlated with increased incidences of hepatocyte hypertrophy at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. Exposure led to a treatment-related increase in hepatic toxicity with a broad spectrum of lesions. Incidences and severities of lesions increased at higher doses and longer durations of exposure. The earliest effects were increased incidences and severities of hepatocyte hypertrophy at 14 weeks. At 2 years, there was a significant increase in toxic hepatopathy characterized by increased incidences of numerous nonneoplastic liver lesions including hepatocyte hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, altered hepatocellular foci, inflammation, pigmentation, diffuse fatty change, necrosis, portal fibrosis, oval cell hyperplasia, bile duct hyperplasia, bile duct cysts, cholangiofibrosis, and nodular hyperplasia At 2 years, the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was significantly increased in the 100 ng/kg core study group. Dose-related increased incidences of cholangiocarcinoma were seen in core study rats administered 22 ng/kg or greater. The highest incidence of cholangiocarcinoma was seen in the 100 ng/kg core study group and included a significant number of animals with multiple cholangiocarcinomas. Two cholangiocarcinomas and two hepatocellular adenomas were seen in the 100 ng/kg stop-exposure group. Two hepatocholangiomas were seen in the 100 ng/kg core study group, and one cholangioma was seen in the 100 ng/kg stop-exposure group. In the lung, the incidence of cystic keratinizing epithelioma of the lung was significantly increased at 2 years in the 100 ng/kg core study group. Nonneoplastic effects in the lung included increased incidences of bronchiolar metaplasia. The incidence of gingival squamous cell carcinoma of the oral mucosa was significantly increased in the 100 ng/kg core study group at 2 years and was accompanied by an increased incidence of gingival squamous hyperplasia. At 2 years, the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterus in the 46 ng/kg group was significantly increased, and there were two squamous cell carcinomas in the 100 ng/kg stop-exposure group. At 2 years, one acinar adenoma and two acinar cell carcinomas of the pancreas were seen in the 100 ng/kg core study group; one acinar carcinoma was seen in the 100 ng/kg stop-exposure group. The incidences of acinar cell adenoma or carcinoma (combined) exceeded the historical vehicle control range. Nonneoplastic effects in the lung included acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization, chronic active inflammation, acinar atrophy, and arterial chronic active inflammation.

To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally-related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. 3,3',4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) was produced commercially before 1977 for the electric industry as a dielectric insulating fluid for transformers and capacitors. Manufacture and use of the chemical was stopped because of increased PCB residues in the environment, but it continues to be released into the environment through the use and disposal of products containing PCBs, as by-products during the manufacture of certain organic chemicals, and during combustion of some waste materials. Bioaccumulation of PCB 126 results in persistent levels in animal and human tissues and the biological responses to PCB 126 are similar to those of TCDD, a known human carcinogen. PCB 126 was selected for study by the National Toxicology Program as a part of the dioxin TEF evaluation to assess the cancer risk posed by complex mixtures of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and PCBs. The dioxin TEF evaluation includes conducting multiple 2-year rat bioassays to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs, structurally related PCBs, and mixtures of these compounds. PCB 126 was included since this is the most potent coplanar PCB that has dioxin-like activities. While one of the aims of the dioxin TEF evaluation was a comparative analysis across studies, in this Technical Report only the results of the PCB 126 study are presented and discussed. Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were administered PCB 126 (99% pure) in corn oil with acetone by gavage for 14, 31, or 53 weeks or 2 years. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of 81 female rats were administered 30, 100, 175, 300, 550, or 1,000 ng PCB 126/kg body weight in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage, 5 days per week, for up to 104 weeks; a group of 81 vehicle control female rats received the corn oil/acetone vehicle alone. A group of 28 rats received 10 ng/kg for up to 53 weeks only. Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, or 53 weeks. A stop-exposure group of 50 female rats was administered 1,000 ng/kg PCB 126 in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 30 weeks then the vehicle for the remainder of the study. Mean body weights of 30 and 100 ng/kg rats were similar to those of the vehicle controls during most of the study, mean body weights of 175 and 300 ng/kg rats were less than those of the vehicle controls during year 2 of the study, and mean body weights of 550 ng/kg, 1,000 ng/kg core study, and 1,000 ng/kg stop-exposure rats were less than those of the vehicle controls after week 17. THYROID HORMONE CONCENTRATIONS: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels were evaluated at the 14-, 31- and 53- week interim evaluations. In the 550 and 1,000 ng/kg rats, total thyroxine (T4) and free T4 were significantly lower than vehicle controls and serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were significantly higher than vehicle controls at the 14-week interim evaluation. Serum T3 was also significantly higher in the 300 ng/kg rats compared to vehicle controls at 14 weeks. At 31 weeks, T3 was significantly higher at doses of 100 ng/kg or greater compared to vehicle controls. TSH levels were higher in 550 and 1,000 ng/kg rats than in vehicle controls. At 53 weeks, significantly lower serum concentrations of total T4 and free T4 were observed compared to vehicle controls in groups administered 175 ng/kg or greater and 30 ng/kg or greater, respectively. Serum T3 levels were significantly higher at doses of 175 ng/kg or greater compared to vehicle controls. No changes in TSH were observed between vehicle controls and dosed rats at 53 weeks. HEPATIC CELL PROLIFERATION DATA: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was conducted at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. The hepatocellular labeling index was significantly higher at doses of 300 ng/kg or greater at 14 weeks and 175 ng/kg or greater at 31 weeks compared to vehicle controls. No statistically significant differences were observed between vehicle controls and PCB 126 dosed rats at 53 weeks. However at 53 weeks, a 5.8-fold increase above the vehicle controls was observed in the 1,000 ng/kg group. CYTOCHROME P450 ENZYME ACTIVITIES: To evaluate the expression of known dioxin-responsive genes, CYP1A1 associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide 4-hydroxylase (A-4-H) activity were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. In addition, CYP2B associated pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (PROD) activity was also analysed. Hepatic PROD (CYP2B1) and hepatic and pulmonary EROD (CYP1A1) activity were significantly greater in all dosed groups than in vehicle controls at weeks 14, 31, and 53. Hepatic A-4-H (CYP1A2) activity was significantly greater in the 30, 100, 175, 300, 550, and 1,000 ng/kg groups compared to vehicle controls at weeks 14, 31, and 53. DETERMINATIONS of PCB 126 CONCENTRATIONS IN TISSUES: The tissue disposition of PCB 126 was analyzed in the liver, lung, fat, and blood of all rats in vehicle controls and all dosed groups at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations and in 10 rats per group including vehicle controls at the end of the 2-year study (104 weeks). Detectable concentrations of PCB 126 were observed in the liver, fat, lung, and blood. Measurable concentrations of PCB 126 were present in the liver and fat at weeks 31, 53, and 104. Hepatic and fat concentrations increased with increasing doses of PCB 126. Measurable concentrations of PCB 126 were present in vehicle control lung tissue at 53 and 104 weeks. No PCB 126 was observed in the blood from the vehicle control rats. Lung and blood concentrations tended to increase with increasing doses of PCB 126, with a few exceptions. In the stop-exposure group, PCB 126 concentrations in liver and fat were lower than the levels observed in the 30 ng/kg group. In the stop-exposure group, lung tissue PCB 126 concentrations were equivalent to the levels observed in the 30 ng/kg group. In blood from the stop-exposure group, PCB 126 concentrations were equivalent to the levels observed in the 100 ng/kg group. PATHOLOGY AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Absolute and relative liver weights were significantly increased at all time points and correlated with increased incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. At 2 years, there were significant treatment-related increases in the incidences of cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular adenoma. Three hepatocholangiomas were seen in the 1,000 ng/kg core study group and a single incidence of cholangioma each occurred in the 550 and 1,000 ng/kg core study groups. At 2 years, a significant dose-related increase in hepatic toxicity was observed and was characterized by increased incidences of numerous lesions including hepatocyte hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, diffuse fatty change, bile duct hyperplasia, bile duct cyst, oval cell hyperplasia, necrosis, pigmentation, inflammation, nodular hyperplasia, portal fibrosis, cholangiofibrosis, and toxic hepatopathy. The incidences of these lesions were generally decreased in the 1,000 ng/kg stop-exposure group compared to the 1,000 ng/kg core study group. The lung weights of 1,000 ng/kg rats were generally significantly increased at weeks 14, 31, and 53. At 2 years, treatment related increases in the incidences of cystic keratinizing epithelioma and squamous cell carcinomas were observed. In addition, dose-related increases in the incidences of bronchiolar metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium and squamous metaplasia were also observed. The incidence of gingival squamous cell carcinoma of the oral mucosa was significantly increased in the 1,000 ng/kg core study group at 2 years. Gingival squamous cell carcinoma, although reduced in incidence as compared to the 1,000 ng/kg core study group, was still present in the 1,000 ng/kg stop-exposure group. At 2 years, adenomas and/or carcinomas were present in the adrenal cortex of most core study groups and in the 1,000 ng/kg stop-exposure group. Dose-related effects on the incidences of adrenal cortex atrophy and cytoplasmic vacuolization were also seen.

Virus replicated more rapidly at lower FBS concentrations (0 or 2%) than at higher concentrations (10 or 20%) during an early stage of infection. Basal and interferon (IFN)-induced levels of typical IFN-inducible anti-viral proteins, such as 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, dsRNA-activated protein kinase and MxA, were unaffected by variation in FBS concentrations. But promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) was expressed in a serum-dependent manner. In particular, the 65 to 70 kDa isoform of PML was markedly upregulated following the addition of serum. In contrast, other isoforms were induced by IFN treatment, and weakly induced by FBS concentrations. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that PML was mainly formed nuclear bodies in Caco-2 cells at various FBS concentrations, and the levels of the PML-nuclear bodies were upregulated by FBS. Overexpression of PML isoform consisting of 560 or 633 amino acid residues by transfection of expression plasmid results in significantly delayed viral replication rate in Caco-2 cells. On the other hand, downregulation of PML expression by RNAi enhanced viral replication. These results indicate that PML isoforms which are expressed in a serum-dependent manner suppress the propagation of influenza virus at an early stage of infection.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=16154611&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Richards, Todd L</author><author>Kozak, Leila</author><author>Johnson, L Clark</author><author>Standish, Leanna J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replicable functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence of correlated brain signals between physically and sensory isolated subjects.</title><secondary-title>Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>955-963</pages><volume>11</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Brain/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Electroencephalography</keyword><keyword>Evoked Potentials</keyword><keyword>Evoked Potentials, Visual*</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intuition*</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging*</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Photic Stimulation*</keyword><keyword>Reaction Time/physiology</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1075-5535</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/acm.2005.11.955</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objectives: Previous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments have suggested that correlated neural signals may be detected in the brains of individuals who are physically and sensorily isolated from each other. Functional MRI and EEG methods were used in the present study in an attempt to replicate these findings. DESIGN/SETTINGS: Subjects were electrically and magnetically shielded because of the characteristic surroundings of the scanner room. During the experiment, the nonstimulated subject was placed in the scanner with sensory isolating goggles covering the subject's eyes. The stimulated subject was placed 30 feet away and sat in front of a video monitor that presented an alternating schedule of six stimulus-on/stimulus-off conditions. The stimulus- on condition consisted of a flickering checkerboard pattern whereas the stimulus-off condition consisted of a static checkerboard. Stimulus-on/-off conditions were presented in the sequence on/off/on/off/on/off. The duration of these intervals was randomly assigned but consistently provided a total of 150 seconds of flicker and 150 seconds of static. Sessions were repeated twice to assess possible replication of the phenomenon.; Outcome Measures: Changes in fMRI brain activation (relating to blood oxygenation) and EEG signals were measured in the nonstimulated subjects. Changes occurring during stimulus-on conditions were statistically compared to changes occurring during the stimulus-off conditions.; Results: Statistically significant changes in fMRI brain activation and EEG signals were observed when comparing the stimulus-on condition to the stimulus-off condition in nonstimulated subjects (p &lt; 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons). For fMRI, these changes were observed in visual brain areas 18 and 19 (Brodmann areas). One of the subjects replicated the results.; Conclusions: These data replicate previous findings suggesting that correlated neural signals may be detected by fMRI and EEG in the brains of subjects who are physically and sensorily isolated from each other.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=16398586&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Xing</author><author>Park, HyunJung</author><author>Zhou, Helen</author><author>Jin, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Overexpression of the M2-2 protein of respiratory syncytial virus inhibits viral replication.</title><secondary-title>Journal of virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of virology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of virology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>13943-13952</pages><volume>79</volume><number>22</number><issue>22</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Chlorocebus aethiops</keyword><keyword>DNA, Complementary/genetics</keyword><keyword>Gene Amplification</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Viral*</keyword><keyword>Genes, Viral</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis</keyword><keyword>Open Reading Frames</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Recombination, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/genetics</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/physiology</keyword><keyword>Restriction Mapping</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/genetics</keyword><keyword>Vero Cells</keyword><keyword>Viral Proteins/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/*physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-538X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JVI.79.22.13943-13952.2005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The M2-2 protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is involved in regulation of viral RNA transcription and replication. Encoded by the next-to-last gene of RSV, the M2-2 open reading frame (ORF) overlaps with the upstream M2-1 ORF, suggesting that the production of the M2-2 protein might be tightly regulated during virus replication. To evaluate the effect of M2-2 overexpression on RSV replication, the M2-2 gene was separated from M2-1 by leaving it at the position prior to the M2-1 or moving it to the promoter proximal position as an independent transcriptional unit in the RSV A2 genome. Although recombinant viruses bearing the shuffled M2-2 gene were recovered and expressed higher levels of M2-2, most of these viruses grew poorly in HEp-2 cells. Sequence analysis revealed that various mutations (substitution, insertion, and deletion) occurred in the M2-2 gene, resulting in reduced M2-2 activity as measured by the RSV minigenome system. Further examination of the M2-2 sequence and its function showed that either one of the first two AUG codons located at the 5' end of M2-2 could be used to produce a functional M2-2 protein and that deletion of the first six amino acids from its N terminus or four amino acids from its C terminus greatly reduced its function. The effect of M2-2 protein on RSV replication was also studied by examining RSV replication in cells transiently expressing M2-2. The M2-2 protein expressed at a high level completely inhibited RSV replication. These results strongly suggested that the level of the M2-2 protein produced in the infected cells is critical to RSV replication.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=16254330&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yi, Tao</author><author>Leung, Kelvin Sze-Yin</author><author>Lu, Guang-Hua</author><author>Zhang, Hao</author><author>Chan, Kelvin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification and comparative determination of senkyunolide A in traditional Chinese medicinal plants Ligusticum chuanxiong and Angelica sinensis by HPLC coupled with DAD and ESI-MS.</title><secondary-title>Chemical &amp; pharmaceutical bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical &amp; pharmaceutical bulletin</full-title><abbr-1>Chemical &amp; pharmaceutical bulletin</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1480-1483</pages><volume>53</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Angelica/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Benzofurans/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Calibration</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid</keyword><keyword>Ligusticum/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Reference Standards</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Solutions</keyword><keyword>Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization</keyword><keyword>Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0009-2363</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1248/cpb.53.1480</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Using the HPLC/DAD/ESI/MS method, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of senkyunolide A (SA) in the rhizomes of Ligusticum chuanxiong (Rhizoma chuanxiong; CX) and roots of Angelica sinensis (DG) was established. As a result, it was found that SA is a characteristic standard compound for the quality evaluation and chemical differentiation between CX and DG. Methanol was chosen in the preparation of standard solutions and extraction of samples based on the stability data. The identity of SA in CX and DG was unambiguously determined based on the quasimolecular ions in ESI-MS. A comprehensive validation of the method, including sensitivity, linearity, reproducibility and recovery, was conducted using the optimized chromatographic conditions. The linear calibration curve was acquired with R2&gt;0.999 and limit of detection (S/N=3) was estimated to be 12.5 mug/g. The reproducibility was evaluated by repeated sample injection and replicated analysis of samples with the relative standard deviation (RSD) value found within 0.68%. The recovery rates of SA varied within the range of 96.91-101.50% with RSD less than 2.38%. In the present work, the contents of SA were quantified within 3.94-9.14 mg/g and 0.108-0.588 mg/g for 12 batches each of CX and DG. The results demonstrated that SA is a useful standard compound for the quality evaluation and chemical differentiation between CX and DG. The analytical procedure is precise and reproducible and thus suitable for the analysis of a large number of samples.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=16272738&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Green, Trevor</author><author>Toghill, Alison</author><author>Lee, Robert</author><author>Waechter, Felix</author><author>Weber, Edgar</author><author>Peffer, Richard</author><author>Noakes, James</author><author>Robinson, Mervyn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thiamethoxam induced mouse liver tumors and their relevance to humans.

Previous studies in mice have characterized a carcinogenicity mode of action that involved depletion of plasma cholesterol, cell death, both as single cell necrosis and as apoptosis, and sustained increases in cell replication rates. In a study reported in this article, female rats have been exposed to thiamethoxam in their diet at concentrations of 0, 1000, and 3000 ppm for 50 weeks, a study design directly comparable to the mouse study in which the mode of action changes were characterized. In rats, thiamethoxam had no adverse effects on either the biochemistry or histopathology of the liver at any time point during the study. Cell replication rates were not increased, in fact they were significantly decreased at several time points. The lack of effect on the rat liver is entirely consistent with the lack of liver tumor formation in the two-year cancer bioassay. Comparisons of the metabolism of thiamethoxam in rats and mice have shown that concentrations of the parent chemical were either similar or higher in rat blood than in mouse blood in both single dose and the dietary studies strongly indicating that thiamethoxam itself is unlikely to play a role in the development of liver tumors. In contrast, the concentrations of the two metabolites, CGA265307 and CGA330050, shown to play a role in the development of liver damage in the mouse, were 140- (CGA265307) and 15- (CGA330050) fold lower in rats than in mice following either a single oral dose, or dietary administration of thiamethoxam for up to 50 weeks. Comparisons of the major metabolic pathways of thiamethoxam in vitro using mouse, rat, and human liver fractions have shown that metabolic rates in humans are lower than those in the rat suggesting that thiamethoxam is unlikely to pose a hazard to humans exposed to this chemical at the low concentrations found in the environment or during its use as an insecticide.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15716476&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wasser, Samuel K</author><author>Hunt, Kathleen E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Noninvasive measures of reproductive function and disturbance in the barred owl, great horned owl, and northern spotted owl.</title><secondary-title>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</abbr-1></periodical><pages>109-137</pages><volume>1046</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carbon Radioisotopes</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods</keyword><keyword>Corticosterone/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Estradiol/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Feces/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hormones/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Progesterone/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Reproduction/physiology</keyword><keyword>Seasons</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Strigiformes/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Strigiformes/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Testosterone/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tritium</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0077-8923</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1196/annals.1343.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There is an urgent need for noninvasive methods to study reproduction and environmental stress in at-risk species such as the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Two related owl species (barred owl and great horned owl) were used as surrogates to validate hormone assays for fecal metabolites of progesterone, 17beta-estradiol, testosterone, and corticosterone. Infusions of radiolabeled hormones showed that the owls excreted most hormone within 6 h. Feces and urine contained roughly equal amounts of hormone, and most fecal hormone metabolites were quite polar. The testosterone and corticosterone assays in this study bound to the major excreted metabolites of these hormones, but two progesterone assays did not appreciably bind to the major progesterone metabolites. All assays showed excellent parallelism with hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed samples and with previously dried or undried fecal samples. Thus, samples do not require hydrolysis or prior drying. Samples from a female barred owl had significantly higher fecal estrogen, lower fecal testosterone, and higher fecal estrogen/testosterone ratio than samples from two male barred owls. The fecal estrogen/testosterone ratio was the most accurate predictor of owl gender, particularly if two or more samples are available from the same individual. Fecal corticosterone metabolites also demonstrated considerable utility for wild northern spotted owls. Fecal glucocorticoid levels varied by gender and breeding stage, being highest in male northern spotted owls early in the breeding season and highest in females when nestlings were fledging. Collectively, these studies show that noninvasive fecal hormone measurements show great promise for noninvasive assessment of reproduction and stress in wild owls.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=16055847&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Butta, Rajeev</author><author>Tredwin, Christopher Jeremy</author><author>Nesbit, Michael</author><author>Moles, David R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Type IV gypsum compatibility with five addition-reaction silicone impression materials.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of prosthetic dentistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of prosthetic dentistry</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of prosthetic dentistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>540-544</pages><volume>93</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Calcium Sulfate/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Dental Impression Materials/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Materials Testing</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Silicone Elastomers/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Siloxanes/chemistry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-3913</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prosdent.2005.04.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Statement of Problem: The compatibility of current addition-reaction silicone impression materials and Type IV gypsum products is not completely understood.; Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare surface detail reproduction between various combinations of contemporary addition-reaction silicone impression materials and Type IV gypsum products.; Material and Methods: Under standardized conditions, 300 impressions were made of a ruled stainless steel die (ADA specification 19), using 5 addition-reaction silicones (Examix-NDS, Doric-ES Flo-Light, Panasil Contact Plus, Extrude Wash, and President Plus Jet). Fifteen impressions of each material were poured with each Type IV gypsum product (Silky-Rock, Fuji Rock, Suprastone, or Vel-Mix). Using x12 magnification, 2 independent examiners scored the reproducibility of a 20-microm line in both the impression and the resultant casts. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-way analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni testing (alpha = .05).; Results: All impression materials tested fully reproduced the 20-microm line. Different impression materials showed different compatibility with different Type IV gypsum products. Only 25% of the Type IV gypsum casts completely reproduced the resultant 20-microm line with fine margins, and 88% of the completely reproduced casts were made from Suprastone.; Conclusion: Not all combinations of impression material and Type IV gypsum products used exhibited similar compatibility.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15942614&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Geenen, P L</author><author>DÃ¶pfer, D</author><author>Van der Meulen, J</author><author>De Jong, M C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transmission of F4+ E. coli in groups of early weaned piglets.</title><secondary-title>Epidemiology and infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Epidemiology and infection</full-title><abbr-1>Epidemiology and infection</abbr-1></periodical><pages>459-468</pages><volume>133</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Antigens, Bacterial/immunology</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Vaccines/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Disease Outbreaks/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Disease Outbreaks/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Disease Transmission, Infectious/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Disease Transmission, Infectious/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections/transmission</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/classification</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Feces/microbiology</keyword><keyword>Fimbriae Proteins</keyword><keyword>Linear Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Netherlands/epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/*transmission</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases/epidemiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0950-2688</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/s0950268804003292</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this study was to estimate transmission parameters of enterotoxigenic F4+ Escherichia coli F4 (F4+ E. coli) in groups of early weaned piglets with F4-receptor-positive (F4R+) and F4-receptor-negative piglets (F4R-). Transmission of F4+ E. coli was quantified in four heterogeneous groups of F4R+ and F4R- piglets. Infectiousness was determined by the number of F4+ E. coli/g faeces shed during 8 days. Transmission parameters were estimated using generalized linear models assuming a stochastic SIR model. F4R+ piglets were found to be more susceptible than F4R- piglets, but F4R+ and F4R- piglets were not different in infectiousness. The reproduction ratios for homogeneous F4R+ and F4R- populations were estimated as 6.37 (95% CI 1.89-21.48) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00-1.13) respectively. The implication of these results is that in order to prevent major outbreaks, the fraction of F4R+ piglets should be small (approximately 10% or less). Therefore, selective breeding programmes could contribute to reducing F4+ E. coli-related diarrhoea and transmission.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15962552&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oda, Shigeto</author><author>Tatarazako, Norihisa</author><author>Watanabe, Hajime</author><author>Morita, Masatoshi</author><author>Iguchi, Taisen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Production of male neonates in four cladoceran species exposed to a juvenile hormone analog, fenoxycarb.</title><secondary-title>Chemosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemosphere</full-title><abbr-1>Chemosphere</abbr-1></periodical><pages>74-78</pages><volume>60</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Cladocera/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Insecticides/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Juvenile Hormones/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Phenylcarbamates/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Reproduction/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Sex Ratio</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-6535</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.12.080</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Previous studies have found that exposure of a cyclic parthenogen, the water flea Daphnia magna (Cladocera, Crustacea), to juvenile hormones and their analogs results in the production of neonates of male sex at concentration-dependent rates. We conducted reproduction experiments in four different species (Moina macrocopa, M. micrura, Ceriodaphnia dubia and C. reticulata) of cladoceran to test for the first time whether the occurrence of this phenomenon after exposure of the parent to such hormones is a generalized phenomenon. In the presence of a juvenile hormone analog, fenoxycarb, all four species produced male neonates and showed reduced rates of reproduction. The estimated median effective concentration (EC50) for the production of male neonates varied with species, ranging from 0.60 x 10(3) to 9.3 x 10(3) ng/l. Although there was a wide range of sensitivity to fenoxycarb, the production of male neonates in all four species demonstrates that this phenomenon is a common response to juvenile hormone analogs and further suggests that these hormones are capable of initiating sexual reproduction in cladocerans, most of which exhibit cyclic parthenogenesis.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15910904&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eckstein, R Lutz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential effects of interspecific interactions and water availability on survival, growth and fecundity of three congeneric grassland herbs.</title><secondary-title>The New phytologist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The New phytologist</full-title><abbr-1>The New phytologist</abbr-1></periodical><pages>525-535</pages><volume>166</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Ecosystem*</keyword><keyword>Reproduction/physiology</keyword><keyword>Soil</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Viola/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Water/*metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0028-646X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01336.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fitness of individual plants and of populations depends on the rates of survival, growth and fecundity. This study tested whether vital rates were differentially affected by biotic interactions and water availability. The effects of manipulations of above-ground competition (through clipping) and water availability (through water addition) on the vital rates of seedlings of three species (Viola elatior Fries, Viola pumila Chaix and Viola stagnina Kit.) were analysed in dry, mesic and wet grasslands. Water addition and grassland type had the largest effects on survival (accounting for 41 and 24% of total variation, respectively) across species. Height growth rate was positively affected by grassland type (19%) and water addition (12%) and varied among species (8%), while leaf accumulation rates and reproduction were affected by grassland type and clipping. The data suggested facilitative effects of the canopy on seedling survival in the dry grassland. This study presents evidence that environmental conditions and biotic interactions may have differential effects on seedling survival, growth and reproduction. The findings highlight the complex interplay between spatial and temporal environmental variation and biotic interactions in structuring plant communities.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15819915&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frederickson, Megan E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ant species confer different partner benefits on two neotropical myrmecophytes.</title><secondary-title>Oecologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oecologia</full-title><abbr-1>Oecologia</abbr-1></periodical><pages>387-395</pages><volume>143</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Ants/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Cordia/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Cordia/growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Feeding Behavior/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Peru</keyword><keyword>Reproduction/physiology</keyword><keyword>Rubiaceae/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Rubiaceae/growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Symbiosis*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0029-8549</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00442-004-1817-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The dynamics of mutualistic interactions involving more than a single pair of species depend on the relative costs and benefits of interaction among alternative partners. The neotropical myrmecophytes Cordia nodosa and Duroia hirsuta associate with several species of obligately symbiotic ants. I compared the ant partners of Cordia and Duroia with respect to two benefits known to be important in ant-myrmecophyte interactions: protection against herbivores provided by ants, and protection against encroaching vegetation provided by ants. Azteca spp., Myrmelachista schumanni, and Allomerus octoarticulatus demerarae ants all provide the leaves of Cordia and Duroia some protection against herbivores. However, Azteca and Allomerus provide more protection than does Myrmelachista to the leaves of their host plants. Although Allomerus protects the leaves of its hosts, plants occupied by Allomerus suffer more attacks by herbivores to their stems than do plants occupied by other ants. Relative to Azteca or Allomerus, Myrmelachista ants provide better protection against encroaching vegetation, increasing canopy openness over their host plants. These differences in benefits among the ant partners of Cordia and Duroia are reflected in the effect of each ant species on host plant size, growth rate, and reproduction. The results of this study show how mutualistic ant partners can differ with respect to both the magnitude and type of benefits they provide to the same species of myrmecophytic host.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15711821&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hendriks, Marike R C</author><author>van Haastregt, Jolanda C M</author><author>Diederiks, Joseph P M</author><author>Evers, Silvia M A A</author><author>Crebolder, Harry F J M</author><author>van Eijk, Jacques Th M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary intervention programme to prevent new falls and functional decline among elderly persons at risk: design of a replicated randomised controlled trial [ISRCTN64716113].</title><secondary-title>BMC public health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC public health</full-title><abbr-1>BMC public health</abbr-1></periodical><pages>6</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>Accidental Falls/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Accidents, Home/prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Cost-Benefit Analysis</keyword><keyword>Environment Design</keyword><keyword>Exercise</keyword><keyword>Health Services for the Aged/*organization &amp; administration</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Patient Education as Topic</keyword><keyword>Program Evaluation</keyword><keyword>Research Design</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-01-14</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2458</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2458-5-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Falls are common among community-dwelling elderly people and can have a considerable impact on quality of life and healthcare costs. People who have sustained a fall are at greater risk of falling again.We replicated a British randomised controlled trial which demonstrated the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary intervention programme to prevent falls. The objective is to describe the design of a replication study evaluating a multidisciplinary intervention programme on recurrent falls and functional decline among elderly persons at risk. The study consists of an effect evaluation, an economic evaluation and a process evaluation.; Methods/design: The programme is aimed at community-dwelling elderly people aged 65 years or over who have visited an accident and emergency department (A&amp;E department) or a general practitioners' cooperative (GP cooperative) because of a fall. The design involves a two-group randomised controlled trial. Participants are followed for twelve months after baseline. The intervention programme consists of a detailed medical and occupational therapy assessment with referral to relevant services if indicated. People in the control group receive usual care. The main outcome measures of the effect evaluation are number of falls and daily functioning. The economic evaluation will be performed from a societal perspective. A process evaluation will be carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention programme.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15651990&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Geenen, P L</author><author>Van der Meulen, J</author><author>Bouma, A</author><author>De Jong, M C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating transmission parameters of F4+ E. coli for F4-receptor-positive and -negative piglets: one-to-one transmission experiment.</title><secondary-title>Epidemiology and infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Epidemiology and infection</full-title><abbr-1>Epidemiology and infection</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1039-1048</pages><volume>132</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adhesins, Escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Antigens, Bacterial/*analysis</keyword><keyword>Disease Outbreaks/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections/*transmission</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Proteins/*analysis</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/*classification</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/*pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Fimbriae Proteins/*analysis</keyword><keyword>Glycoproteins</keyword><keyword>Immunity, Innate</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Serotyping</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0950-2688</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/s0950268804002675</electronic-resource-num><abstract>F4+ Escherichia coli is an important agent of post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets. Piglets that express an adhesion site for F4+ E. coli in their small intestine (F4R+) shed higher numbers of F4+ E. coli than piglets lacking this site (F4R-). We hypothesized that F4R+ piglets are more infectious and more susceptible for F4+ E. coli. This implies that in populations with F4R+ and F4R- piglets, the transmission would be dependent on the frequency of both types of animals. To quantify the difference in infectiousness and susceptibility, a one-to-one transmission experiment was performed with 20 pairs consisting of one inoculated and one contact piglet. Based on the contact infections observed, transmission parameters were estimated with generalized linear models. F4R+ piglets were infectious for other piglets and the reproduction ratio (R0) for homogeneous F4R+ populations, that is the average number of secondary infections that one F4R+ pig will cause during its entire infectious period in a population of susceptible F4R+ individuals only, was estimated as 7.1. F4R+ piglets were more susceptible than F4R- piglets and reducing the fraction of F4R+ piglets of a population will reduce transmission. It was calculated that in order to prevent major outbreaks of F4+ E. coli (R0 &lt; 1), the fraction of F4R+ piglets must be lower than 0.14.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15635960&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shepherd, Bryan E</author><author>Guttorp, Peter</author><author>Lansdorp, Peter M</author><author>Abkowitz, Janis L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating human hematopoietic stem cell kinetics using granulocyte telomere lengths.</title><secondary-title>Experimental hematology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental hematology</full-title><abbr-1>Experimental hematology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1040-1050</pages><volume>32</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle</keyword><keyword>Granulocytes/*ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Models, Theoretical*</keyword><keyword>Telomere/*ultrastructure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0301-472X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.exphem.2004.07.023</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: To study in vivo behavior of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).; Materials and Methods: Behavior of HSC is difficult to study because one cannot observe and track cells within the marrow microenvironment.

Standardized annual costs were then assigned to Medicaid claims diagnoses, and individual health problem severity was measured as the sum of estimated treatment costs for diagnosed conditions.; Results: Seventy-four percent of the study sample (N=109) had been given a diagnosis of at least one chronic health problem, and 50 percent (N=73) had been given a diagnosis of two or more chronic health problems. Of the 14 chronic health conditions surveyed, chronic pulmonary illness was the most prevalent (31 percent incidence) and the most comorbid. Persons with chronic pulmonary illness were second only to those with infectious diseases in average annual cost of treatment ($8,277). Also, 50 percent or more of participants in eight other diagnostic categories had chronic pulmonary illness. A regression analysis identified age, obesity, and substance use disorders as significant predictors of individual health problem severity.; Conclusions: Risk adjustment for physical health is essential when setting performance standards or cost expectations for mental health treatment. Excluding persons with chronic health problems from mental health service evaluations restricts generalizability of research findings and may promote interventions that are inappropriate for many persons with serious mental illness.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15534013&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, Marjo V</author><author>Nyska, Abraham</author><author>Portier, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of a statistical dynamic model investigating the short-term cellular kinetics induced by riddelliine, a hepatic endothelial carcinogen.</title><secondary-title>Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology</full-title><abbr-1>Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>258-267</pages><volume>80</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens/*pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Cell Count</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells/metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelium/pathology</keyword><keyword>Hemangiosarcoma/*chemically induced</keyword><keyword>Hemangiosarcoma/pathology</keyword><keyword>Hepatocytes/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Hepatocytes/pathology</keyword><keyword>Least-Squares Analysis</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms/*chemically induced</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms/pathology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Models, Statistical</keyword><keyword>Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids/*pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids/*toxicity</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Rats, Inbred F344</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1096-6080</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/toxsci/kfh157</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In recent studies, riddelliine, a pyrrolizidine alkaloid, was found to increase rates of replication and apoptosis and induce hemangiosarcoma in the liver of rats and mice.

The model allows the incorporation of simple diurnal patterns in cellular kinetics and is applied to data on hepatocytes and endothelial cells taken from riddelliine exposed rats. Predictions from the model were used with multivariable nonlinear regression techniques to estimate replication and apoptotic rate constants for both cell types and all treatment groups. Hypothesis tests were used with the predicted rates to separate the competing effects of riddelliine on replication and apoptosis of hepatocytes and endothelial cells as well as compare replication rates between cell types.

We have initiated studies to define the molecular mechanisms by which a recent pathogenic isolate of WNV evades the host cell innate antiviral response. Biochemical and microarray analyses demonstrated that WNV induced the expression of beta interferon (IFN-beta) and several IFN-stimulated genes late in infection of cultured human cells. The late expression of these antiviral genes was due to the delayed activation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Despite this host response, WNV was still able to replicate efficiently. The effect of the IRF-3 pathway on WNV replication was assessed by examining virus replication and spread in cultures of wild-type or IRF-3-null mouse embryo fibroblasts. The absence of IRF-3 was marked by a significant increase in plaque size and a sustained production of infectious particles. Although the activation of the IRF-3 pathway was not sufficient to block virus replication, our results suggest that IRF-3 target genes function to constrain WNV infection and limit cell-to-cell virus spread.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15220448&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sugiyama, Masashi</author><author>Kawanabe, Motoaki</author><author>MÃ¼ller, Klaus-Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trading variance reduction with unbiasedness: the regularized subspace information criterion for robust model selection in kernel regression.</title><secondary-title>Neural computation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neural computation</full-title><abbr-1>Neural computation</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1077-1104</pages><volume>16</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Bayes Theorem</keyword><keyword>Models, Neurological*</keyword><keyword>Models, Statistical*</keyword><keyword>Normal Distribution</keyword><keyword>Regression Analysis*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0899-7667</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1162/089976604773135113</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A well-known result by Stein (1956) shows that in particular situations, biased estimators can yield better parameter estimates than their generally preferred unbiased counterparts. This letter follows the same spirit, as we will stabilize the unbiased generalization error estimates by regularization and finally obtain more robust model selection criteria for learning. We trade a small bias against a larger variance reduction, which has the beneficial effect of being more precise on a single training set. We focus on the subspace information criterion (SIC), which is an unbiased estimator of the expected generalization error measured by the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm. SIC can be applied to the kernel regression, and it was shown in earlier experiments that a small regularization of SIC has a stabilization effect. However, it remained open how to appropriately determine the degree of regularization in SIC. In this article, we derive an unbiased estimator of the expected squared error, between SIC and the expected generalization error and propose determining the degree of regularization of SIC such that the estimator of the expected squared error is minimized. Computer simulations with artificial and real data sets illustrate that the proposed method works effectively for improving the precision of SIC, especially in the high-noise-level cases. We furthermore compare the proposed method to the original SIC, the cross-validation, and an empirical Bayesian method in ridge parameter selection, with good results.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=15070511&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashouri, A</author><author>Arzanian, N</author><author>Askary, H</author><author>Rasoulian, G R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pathogenicity of the fungus, Verticillium lecanii, to the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Hom.: Aphididae).</title><secondary-title>Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences</abbr-1></periodical><pages>205-209</pages><volume>69</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aphids/*microbiology</keyword><keyword>Aphids/growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Nicotiana/parasitology</keyword><keyword>Nymph/microbiology</keyword><keyword>Pest Control, Biological/methods</keyword><keyword>Prunus/*parasitology</keyword><keyword>Verticillium/*pathogenicity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1379-1176</isbn><abstract>Pathogenicity of the hyphomycete, Verticillium lecanii (DAOM 198499), was investigated to aphid, Myzus persicae under laboratory conditions.

Methodological approaches for controlling threats to external validity and strategies to enhance external validity and generalizability of findings are discussed.; Conclusions: Generalizability of findings is not assured even if internal validity of a research study is addressed effectively through design. Strict controls to ensure internal validity can compromise generalizability.

There are 2 aspects to this problem, the wettability of the polymerized impression by dental gypsum materials and the ability of the unpolymerized material to wet intraoral tissues. To address this problem, manufacturers have added surfactants and labeled the new products as hydrophilic vinyl polysiloxane.; Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to compare dimensional accuracy and surface detail reproduction of 2 hydrophilic VPS impression materials, when used under dry, moist, and wet conditions.; Materials and Methods: A total of 102 impressions were made of stainless steel metal dies similar to those described in American Dental Association (ADA) specification 19. The dies had 2 vertical and 3 horizontal lines inscribed on their superior surfaces. Impressions were made under dry, moist, and wet conditions. Dimensional accuracy was measured by comparing the average length of the middle horizontal line in each impression to the same line on the metal die, by use of a measuring microscope with an accuracy of 0.001 mm. A 2-way analysis of variance and least significant difference post hoc test were used to compare mean dimensional changes (alpha=.05). Surface detail reproduction was evaluated in 2 ways: (1) by use of criteria similar to ADA specification 19 for detail reproduction, continuous replication of at least 2 of the 3 horizontal lines, and (2) by use of a method developed for this study that categorized the impressions as satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on their surface characteristics: presence of pits, voids, or roughness. Pearson chi(2) (alpha=.05) was used to compare detail reproduction results.; Results: Conditions (dry, moist, and wet) did not cause significant adverse effects on the dimensional accuracy of either material. The mean dimensional change and SD were 0.005% +/- 0.002% or less. With both surface detail analyses, dry, moist, and wet conditions had a significant effect on the detail reproduction of both materials (P&lt;.05). Only under dry conditions did both impression materials continuously replicate at least 2 of the 3 horizontal lines 100% of the time. Under moist conditions, 82% of the Aquasil impressions and 100% of the Reprosil impressions were judged satisfactory, while under wet conditions, only 47% Aquasil and 11% Reprosil impressions were satisfactory. With the additional surface detail characterization, only under dry conditions were impressions produced with clinically acceptable surface quality (Aquasil 77% and Reprosil 100% satisfactory).; Conclusions: Dimensional accuracy of both materials tested was well within ADA standards. Best surface detail results were obtained only under dry conditions for both materials.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=14564291&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cole, Steve W</author><author>Galic, Zoran</author><author>Zack, Jerome A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Controlling false-negative errors in microarray differential expression analysis: a PRIM approach.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title><abbr-1>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1808-1816</pages><volume>19</volume><number>14</number><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms*</keyword><keyword>Artificial Intelligence*</keyword><keyword>False Negative Reactions</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling/*methods</keyword><keyword>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods</keyword><keyword>Quality Control</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Sequence Alignment/*methods</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003-09-22</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1367-4803</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btg242</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Motivation: Theoretical considerations suggest that current microarray screening algorithms may fail to detect many true differences in gene expression (Type II analytic errors). We assessed 'false negative' error rates in differential expression analyses by conventional linear statistical models (e.g. t-test), microarray-adapted variants (e.g. SAM, Cyber-T), and a novel strategy based on hold-out cross-validation. The latter approach employs the machine-learning algorithm Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) to infer minimum thresholds for reliable change in gene expression from Boolean conjunctions of fold-induction and raw fluorescence measurements.; Results: Monte Carlo analyses based on four empirical data sets show that conventional statistical models and their microarray-adapted variants overlook more than 50% of genes showing significant up-regulation. Conjoint PRIM prediction rules recover approximately twice as many differentially expressed transcripts while maintaining strong control over false-positive (Type I) errors. As a result, experimental replication rates increase and total analytic error rates decline. RT-PCR studies confirm that gene inductions detected by PRIM but overlooked by other methods represent true changes in mRNA levels. PRIM-based conjoint inference rules thus represent an improved strategy for high-sensitivity screening of DNA microarrays.; Availability: Freestanding JAVA application at http://microarray.crump.ucla.edu/focus</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=14512352&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Willour, Virginia L</author><author>Zandi, Peter P</author><author>Huo, Yuqing</author><author>Diggs, Tyra L</author><author>Chellis, Jennifer L</author><author>MacKinnon, Dean F</author><author>Simpson, Sylvia G</author><author>McMahon, Francis J</author><author>Potash, James B</author><author>Gershon, Elliot S</author><author>Reich, Theodore</author><author>Foroud, Tatiana</author><author>Nurnberger, John I, Jr</author><author>DePaulo, J Raymond, Jr</author><author>McInnis, Melvin G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome scan of the fifty-six bipolar pedigrees from the NIMH genetics initiative replication sample: chromosomes 4, 7, 9, 18, 19, 20, and 21.</title><secondary-title>American journal of medical genetics.

In 1997, the four participating sites published a genome scan on the initial set of 97 bipolar pedigrees. Fifty-six additional bipolar pedigrees have now been ascertained and evaluated. This replication pedigree set contains 354 genotyped subjects, including 139 bipolar I (BPI) subjects, five schizoaffective bipolar type SA/BP subjects, 41 bipolar II (BPII) subjects, and 43 recurrent unipolar (RUP) depression subjects. Our site has recently genotyped the replication study bipolar pedigrees using 107 microsatellite markers from chromosomes 4, 7, 9, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We are now reporting parametric and nonparametric linkage results from this effort. Multipoint nonparametric linkage analysis produced three candidate regions with allele sharing LOD scores &gt;/= 1.0. The linkage signal on 4q35 peaked between markers D4S3335 and D4S2390 with an allele sharing LOD score of 2.49. This finding exceeds standard criteria for suggestive linkage. Two additional loci approach suggestive linkage levels: the 4q32 finding had its maximum near marker D4S1629 with an allele sharing LOD score of 2.16, and the 20p12 finding peaked at D20S162 with an allele sharing LOD score of 1.82. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis produced similar findings. When we combined the genotype data from the original and the replication pedigree sets, 20p12 yielded a nonparametric LOD score of 2.38, which exceeds standard criteria for suggestive linkage, and a corresponding parametric HLOD score of 2.98. The combined analysis did not provide further support for linkage to 4q32 and 4q35.

In the future, this social and medical burden will increase due to the greater number of patients with chronic liver disease and their improved survival. In this study, our aims were (1) to identify clinical, biochemical, and ultrasonographic parameters which might non-invasively predict the presence of OV in patients with liver cirrhosis; (2) to evaluate the reproducibility of the obtained results in a different, although related, further group of patients; and (3) to assess the predictiveness of the identified rules in patients with compensated cirrhosis.; Methods: In the first part of the study we retrospectively evaluated the presence of OV in 145 cirrhotic patients, and in the second part we evaluated the reproducibility of the study results in a subsequent group of 121 patients. Finally, we evaluated these parameters in a subgroup of 145 patients with compensated disease. All 266 patients underwent a complete biochemical workup, upper digestive endoscopy, and ultrasonographic measurement of spleen bipolar diameter. Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio was calculated for all patients.; Results: The prevalence rates of OV were 61% and 58% in the first and second groups of patients, respectively. In the first part of the study, we found that platelet count, spleen diameter, platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, and Child- Pugh class were significantly different among patients with or without OV, although the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio was the only parameter which was independently associated with the presence of OV in a multivariate analysis. A platelet count/spleen diameter ratio cut off value of 909 had 100% negative predictive value for a diagnosis of OV. This result was reproduced in the second group of patients as well as in patients with compensated disease. In a cost-benefit analysis, screening cirrhotic patients according to the "platelet count/spleen diameter ratio strategy" was far more cost effective compared with the "scope all strategy".; Conclusions: The platelet count/spleen diameter ratio is the only parameter which is independently associated with the presence of OV, and its negative predictive value is reproducible. Its use is of value even in the subgroup of patients with compensated disease, and it is also cost effective.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=12865282&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pease, William S</author><author>Elinski, Michael A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Surface and wire electromyographic.

Surface and intramuscular electrodes (i.m.) are employed by different researchers and there is a continuing need to understand the indications for each. This research evaluated the reproducibility of the shift of the frequency content of the EMG signals during fatiguing exercise using simultaneous recording with these two electrode types. Using healthy adult volunteers, EMG recordings from the vastus lateralis (VL) and anterior tibial (AT) were made during repeated isokinetic exertions causing fatigue. The median power frequency (MPF) was calculated for a 0.5 sec sample of data taken during each concentric contraction. Test-retest, and multiple day repeat testing were performed to exclude the effects of training and fatigue upon the data. Surface electrode recordings demonstrated better reliability testing with values of 0.54 for VL and 0.68 for AT, while simultaneous i.m. recordings were -0.90 and 0.47, respectively. This finding of greater reliability, combined with the ease of use of surface electrodes suggest that they should be preferred for most studies of EMG analysis of muscle fatigue.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=12964253&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yao, Ermei</author><author>Schaller, Heinz</author><author>Tavis, John E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The duck hepatitis B virus polymerase and core proteins accumulate in different patterns from their common mRNA.</title><secondary-title>Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virology</full-title><abbr-1>Virology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>81-88</pages><volume>311</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Ducks</keyword><keyword>Hepadnaviridae Infections/virology</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis B Virus, Duck/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis, Viral, Animal/virology</keyword><keyword>Liver/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Poultry Diseases/virology</keyword><keyword>Protein Biosynthesis*</keyword><keyword>RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger/analysis</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Viral Core Proteins/*biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003-06-20</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0042-6822</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00142-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Hepadnaviral reverse transcription occurs in capsids in which the core (C) protein surrounds the reverse transcriptase (P) and pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). We analyzed the accumulation patterns of duck hepatitis B virus P, C, and pgRNA in transfected LMH cells, infected primary duck hepatocytes (PDH), and infected duck liver. In all three systems, P accumulated over time in a different pattern compared with C, despite translation of both proteins from the pgRNA. Although the accumulation patterns of the proteins varied between the systems, in each case P became detectable at the same time or earlier than C and the ratio of P relative to C dropped with time. These accumulation patterns were consistent with the translation rates and half-lives of P and C. Comparing the translation rates of P and C with the pgRNA level over time revealed that translation of P and C was negatively regulated in LMH cells.

Using this model, we determined the R0 of the A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/21525/83 (LPAI) and of the A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83 (HPAI).

Results suggest that a variety of behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and pharmacological interventions are effective in reducing symptoms of childhood depression, phobias, and anxiety disorders. None of the studies reviewed included substance abuse outcomes. Thus, little can be said about the relationship between early treatment and the prevention of later substance use.

Because intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility is highly relevant for application of DNA-microarray analysis in functional genomics and metabolic engineering, we designed a set of experiments to specifically address this issue. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D was grown under defined conditions in glucose-limited chemostats, followed by transcriptome analysis with Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. In each of the laboratories, three independent replicate cultures were grown aerobically as well as anaerobically. Although variations introduced by in vitro handling steps were small and unbiased, greater variation from replicate cultures underscored that, to obtain reliable information, experimental replication is essential. Under aerobic conditions, 86% of the most highly expressed yeast genes showed an average intralaboratory coefficient of variation of 0.23. This is significantly lower than previously reported for shake-flask-culture transcriptome analyses and probably reflects the strict control of growth conditions in chemostats. Using the triplicate data sets and appropriate statistical analysis, the change calls from anaerobic versus aerobic comparisons yielded an over 95% agreement between the laboratories for transcripts that changed by over 2-fold, leaving only a small fraction of genes that exhibited laboratory bias.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=12121991&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nosil, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transition rates between specialization and generalization in phytophagous insects.</title><secondary-title>Evolution; international journal of organic evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Evolution; international journal of organic evolution</full-title><abbr-1>Evolution; international journal of organic evolution</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1701-1706</pages><volume>56</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological Evolution</keyword><keyword>Host-Parasite Interactions/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Host-Parasite Interactions/genetics</keyword><keyword>Insecta/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Insecta/classification</keyword><keyword>Insecta/genetics</keyword><keyword>Magnoliopsida/*parasitology</keyword><keyword>Magnoliopsida/classification</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny*</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0014-3820</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb01482.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although most species of animals exhibit specialized patterns of resource use, it is unclear whether specialization evolves at a faster rate than generalization. To test this hypothesis, transition rates toward specialization and toward generalization were estimated using phylogenies from 15 groups of phytophagous insects. Among the groups studied, maximum-likelihood analyses showed that the forward transition rate from generalization to specialization was significantly higher than the reverse transition rate from specialization to generalization (mean ratio of forward to reverse transition rate = 1.47 using uniform branch lengths and 1.76 using Grafen branch lengths). Although phylogenetic conservatism of host-plant use is common, the results suggest that the evolution of specialization is a highly dynamic process. For example, higher transitions rates both toward and away from specialization as well as equal transition rates were inferred. Collectively, the results reveal a tendency for directional evolution toward increased specialization but also indicate that specialization does not always represent an evolutionary dead-end that strongly limits further evolution.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=12353763&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hohe, Jan</author><author>Ateshian, Gerard</author><author>Reiser, Maximilian</author><author>Englmeier, Karl-Hans</author><author>Eckstein, Felix</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Surface size, curvature analysis, and assessment of knee joint incongruity with MRI in vivo.</title><secondary-title>Magnetic resonance in medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Magnetic resonance in medicine</full-title><abbr-1>Magnetic resonance in medicine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>554-561</pages><volume>47</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Imaging, Three-Dimensional</keyword><keyword>Knee Joint/*anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Osteoarthritis/diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0740-3194</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/mrm.10097</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The purpose of this study was to develop an MR-based technique for quantitative analysis of joint surface size, surface curvature, and joint incongruity and to assess its reproducibility under in vivo imaging conditions. The surface areas were determined after 3D reconstruction of the joint by triangulation and the incongruity by Gaussian curvature analysis. The precision was tested by analyzing four replicated MRI datasets of human knees in 14 individuals. The algorithms were shown to produce accurate data in geometric test objects. The interscan precision was &lt;4% (CV%) for surface area, 2.9-5.7 m(-1) (SD) for the mean principal curvature, and 4.1-7.4 m(-1) for congruence indices. Incongruity was highest in the femoropatellar joint (79.7 m(-1)) and lowest in the medial femorotibial joint (28.6 m(-1)). This technique will permit identification of the specific role of surface size, curvature, and incongruity as potential risk factors for osteoarthritis.

This study examined whether these same properties also affect spoken-word production, particularly as related to children with functional phonological delays. The hypothesis was that differential generalization would be associated with a word's frequency and its neighborhood density when manipulated as input in phonological treatment. Using a multiple baseline across subjects design, 8 children (aged 3;10 to 5;4) were randomly enrolled in 1 of 4 experimental conditions targeting errored sounds in high-frequency, low-frequency, high-density, or low-density words. Dependent measures were generalization of treated sounds and untreated sounds within and across manner classes as measured during and following treatment. Results supported a hierarchy of phonological generalization by experimental condition. The clinical implications lie in planning for generalization through the input presented in treatment. Theoretically, the results demonstrate that lexical organization of words in the mental lexicon interacts with phonological structure in learning.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=14748645&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wahl, Markus C</author><author>MÃ¶ller, Wim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structure and function of the acidic ribosomal stalk proteins.</title><secondary-title>Current protein &amp; peptide science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current protein &amp; peptide science</full-title><abbr-1>Current protein &amp; peptide science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>93-106</pages><volume>3</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Crystallography, X-Ray</keyword><keyword>GTPase-Activating Proteins/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Peptide Elongation Factor Tu/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Protein Biosynthesis/physiology</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure, Tertiary</keyword><keyword>Ribosomal Proteins/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Ribosomal Proteins/physiology</keyword><keyword>Ribosomes/metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1389-2037</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2174/1389203023380756</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The acidic L7/L12 (prokaryotes) and P1/P2 (eukaryotes) proteins are the only ribosomal components that occur in more than one, specifically four, copies in the translational machinery. These ribosomal proteins are the only ones that do not directly interact with ribosomal RNA but bind to the particles via a protein, L10 and P0, respectively. They constitute a morphologically distinct feature on the large subunit, the stalk protuberance. Since a long time proteins L7/L12 have been implicated in translation factor binding and in the stimulation of the factor-dependent GTP-hydrolysis. Recent studies reproduced such activities with the isolated components and L7/L12 can therefore in retrospect be regarded as the first GTPase activating proteins identified. GTP-hydrolysis induces a drastic conformational change in elongation factor (EF) Tu, which enables it to dissociate from the ribosome after having successfully delivered aminoacylated tRNA into the A-site. It is also used as a driving force for translocation, mediated by EF-G. The in vitro stimulation of translation-uncoupled EF-G-dependent GTP-hydrolysis seems to be an intrinsic property of the ribosome that is dependent on L7/L12, reaches a maximum with four copies of the proteins per particle, and reflects the in vivo hydrolysis rate during translation. It is much larger than the analogous activity observed for EF-Tu, which is correlated with the in vitro polypeptide synthesis rate. Therefore, at least certain stimulatory activities of L7/L12 are controlled by the ribosomal environment, which in the case of EF-Tu senses the successful codon-anticodon pairing. Present knowledge is consistent with a picture in which proteins L7/L12 constitute a "landing platform" for the factors and after rearrangements induce GTP-hydrolysis. The molecular mechanism of the GTPase activation is unknown. While sequence comparisons show a large diversity in the stalk proteins across the kingdoms, a conserved functional domain organization and conserved designs of their genetic units are discernible. Consistently, stalk transplantation experiments suggest that coevolution took place to maintain functional L7/L12 EF-G and P-protein EF-2 couples. The acidic proteins are organized into three distinct functional parts: An N-terminal domain is responsible for oligomerization and ribosome association, a C-terminal domain is implicated in translation factor interactions, and a hinge region allows a flexible relative orientation of the latter two portions. The bacterial L7/L12 proteins have long been portrayed as highly elongated dimers displaying globular C-terminal domains, helical N-termini, and unstructured hinges. Conversely, recent crystal structures depict a compact hetero-tetrameric assembly with the hinge region adopting either an alpha-helical or an open conformation. Two different dimerization modes can be discerned in these structures. Models suggest that dimerization via one association mode can lead to elongated dimeric complexes with one helical and one unstructured hinge. The physiological role of the other dimerization mode is unclear and is in apparent contradiction to distances measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The discrepancies between the crystal structures and results from other physico-chemical methods may partly be a consequence of the dynamic functions of the proteins, necessitating a high flexibility.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=12370014&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacDougall, T H J</author><author>Shattock, R J</author><author>Madsen, C</author><author>Chain, B M</author><author>Katz, D R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of primary HIV-1 isolate replication in dendritic cells.</title><secondary-title>Clinical and experimental immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical and experimental immunology</full-title><abbr-1>Clinical and experimental immunology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>66-71</pages><volume>127</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Communication/immunology</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Dendritic Cells/*virology</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections/*virology</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections/immunology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes/immunology</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes/virology</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0009-9104</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01715.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The potential role of dendritic cells (DC) in the immunopathology of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) disease remains controversial. This study examines replication of a panel of HIV-1 strains (both laboratory adapted and primary) within DC, in the context of the well-established monocyte-DC and monocyte-macrophage transition. Viral replication was assessed by p24 ELISA assay. All strains of HIV-1 tested replicated in DC. Only CCR5-tropic virus replicated in macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced DC maturation (as reflected in altered cell phenotype) and at the same time diminished the ability of DC to support HIV-1 replication. In contrast the presence of activated T cells, which had been fixed to prevent them acting as a site for viral replication, enhanced the ability of the DC to support viral replication, as has been reported previously for macrophages. Thus cells that are DC by phenotype, but are not activated, act as the optimum reservoir for HIV-1 replication. If this form of DC is present in peripheral tissues, this will be permissive for amplification of the in vivo viral load at sites where there are few responder cells available, and hence contribute to the persistent immunopathology.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11882034&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hayes, Michael M</author><author>Lane, Brian R</author><author>King, Steven R</author><author>Markovitz, David M</author><author>Coffey, Michael J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prostaglandin E(2) inhibits replication of HIV-1 in macrophages through activation of protein kinase A.</title><secondary-title>Cellular immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cellular immunology</full-title><abbr-1>Cellular immunology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>61-71</pages><volume>215</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Bucladesine/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Colforsin/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dinoprostone/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Dinoprostone/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Macrophages/*virology</keyword><keyword>Macrophages/enzymology</keyword><keyword>Macrophages/immunology</keyword><keyword>Misoprostol/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Monocytes/physiology</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Receptors, CCR5/metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/*drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-8749</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0008-8749(02)00017-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Since macrophages are a source of increased PGE(2) in AIDS, we investigated the role of PGE(2) in the replication of HIV-1 in these cells. PGE(2) inhibited HIV-1 replication measured by reverse transcriptase in human monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM). Treatment of MDM with the PGE(1) analog misoprostol, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, and the cyclic AMP analog dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (db-cAMP) suppressed HIV replication. The protein kinase A (PKA) activator 8-bromo-cyclic AMP also inhibited HIV-1 replication. Similar results were observed with the entry-independent, latently HIV-infected U1 cells. There was a parallel decrease in HIV-1 mRNA levels following PGE(2) treatment. Co-transfection of the HIV-1 promoter LTR.luciferase, with the vector CMV.Calpha, which expresses the PKA catalytic unit increasing PKA activity, reduced HIV-1 promoter activity. Inhibition of PKA activity with the pMT.RAB vector, a mutant regulatory unit of PKA, augmented HIV-1 promoter activity. In summary, PGE(2) inhibits HIV-1 gene expression in MDM through a PKA-dependent mechanism.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=12142037&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, B</author><author>Karpen, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Centromere identity in Drosophila is not determined in vivo by replication timing.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of cell biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of cell biology</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of cell biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>683-690</pages><volume>154</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Centromere Protein A</keyword><keyword>Centromere/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Centromere/ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Chromatin/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes/ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>Drosophila</keyword><keyword>Drosophila Proteins*</keyword><keyword>Histones/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Models, Genetic</keyword><keyword>S Phase</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-08-20</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9525</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1083/jcb.200103001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Centromeric chromatin is uniquely marked by the centromere-specific histone CENP-A. For assembly of CENP-A into nucleosomes to occur without competition from H3 deposition, it was proposed that centromeres are among the first or last sequences to be replicated. In this study, centromere replication in Drosophila was studied in cell lines and in larval tissues that contain minichromosomes that have structurally defined centromeres. Two different nucleotide incorporation methods were used to evaluate replication timing of chromatin containing CID, a Drosophila homologue of CENP-A. Centromeres in Drosophila cell lines were replicated throughout S phase but primarily in mid S phase. However, endogenous centromeres and X-derived minichromosome centromeres in vivo were replicated asynchronously in mid to late S phase. Minichromosomes with structurally intact centromeres were replicated in late S phase, and those in which centric and surrounding heterochromatin were partially or fully deleted were replicated earlier in mid S phase. We provide the first in vivo evidence that centromeric chromatin is replicated at different times in S phase. These studies indicate that incorporation of CID/CENP-A into newly duplicated centromeres is independent of replication timing and argue against determination of centromere identity by temporal sequestration of centromeric chromatin replication relative to bulk genomic chromatin.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11514585&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gajalakshmi, S</author><author>Ramasamy, E V</author><author>Abbasi, S A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards maximising output from vermireactors fed with cowdung spiked paper waste.</title><secondary-title>Bioresource technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioresource technology</full-title><abbr-1>Bioresource technology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>67-72</pages><volume>79</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biodegradation, Environmental</keyword><keyword>Bioreactors*</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Industrial Waste*</keyword><keyword>Manure</keyword><keyword>Oligochaeta/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Paper*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0960-8524</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0960-8524(01)00003-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Paper waste, spiked with varying proportions of cowdung, was vermicomposted in 'low-rate' and 'high-rate' reactors. The former type of reactors had earthworm populations and feed loading rates similar to ones recommended by previous workers. The 'high-rate' reactors were operated with 12.5 times higher earthworm densities and feed loading rates. All the reactors were studied for six months to assess the vermicast output, survivability, growth and reproduction of the earthworms hence the sustainability of the reactors--for long-term, continuous operation. The studies revealed the viability of the high-rate vermireactor concept. The high-rate reactors consistently produced over 6.5 times more castings per unit digester volume with no adverse effect on the earthworm population, as reflected by (a) absence of mortality, (b) consistent growth in worm zoomass, and (c) normal rate of reproduction. The studies also revealed that an increase in the cowdung fraction in the feed from 14.3% to 20% (4:1 paper:cowdung blends to 6:1 blends) had little positive impact on the vermicast output or earthworm health. This indicated that spiking of paper feed with approximately 14% cowdung, or perhaps an even smaller fraction, might be adequate to support earthworms in the paper-fed vermireactors.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11396910&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goel, A</author><author>Frank-Kamenetskii, M D</author><author>Ellenberger, T</author><author>Herschbach, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tuning DNA "strings": modulating the rate of DNA replication with mechanical tension.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</abbr-1></periodical><pages>8485-8489</pages><volume>98</volume><number>15</number><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>Bacteriophage T7/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Polymerase I/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry</keyword><keyword>DNA, Single-Stranded/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/chemistry</keyword><keyword>DNA/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Models, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Conformation*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-07-17</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.151261198</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent experiments have measured the rate of replication of DNA catalyzed by a single enzyme moving along a stretched template strand. The dependence on tension was interpreted as evidence that T7 and related DNA polymerases convert two (n = 2) or more single-stranded template bases to double helix geometry in the polymerization site during each catalytic cycle. However, we find structural data on the T7 enzyme--template complex indicate n = 1. We also present a model for the "tuning" of replication rate by mechanical tension. This model considers only local interactions in the neighborhood of the enzyme, unlike previous models that use stretching curves for the entire polymer chain. Our results, with n = 1, reconcile force-dependent replication rate studies with structural data on DNA polymerase complexes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11447284&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paoloni-Giacobino, A</author><author>Rossier, C</author><author>Papasavvas, M P</author><author>Antonarakis, S E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Frequency of replication/transcription errors in (A)/(T) runs of human genes.</title><secondary-title>Human genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Human genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>40-47</pages><volume>109</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Aging/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>DNA Damage</keyword><keyword>DNA Helicases*</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication/*genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA/genetics</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genome, Human</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Nuclear Proteins*</keyword><keyword>Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics</keyword><keyword>Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid</keyword><keyword>RNA/genetics</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors/genetics</keyword><keyword>Transcription, Genetic*</keyword><keyword>X-linked Nuclear Protein</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0340-6717</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s004390100541</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To estimate the error rate of the gene expression machinery and its possible age-related increase, we compared the occurrence of polymerase errors during replication and transcription in (A)/(T) runs, in DNA and RNA of young and old individuals and of early- and late-passage cultured fibroblasts. We analyzed three human genes: TPRD, TGFBR2, and ATRX containing stretches of (A)8, (A)10, and (T)13, respectively. The error rate was determined by sequencing 100 cloned PCR or RT-PCR fragments from each DNA and RNA sample. The error rates in replication and transcription increased with the stretch length. The pooled error rates for genomic DNA were: TPRD (A)8, TGFBR2 (A)10, and ATRX (T)13: 1%+/-0.41, 15.8%+/-1.3, and 31.3%+/-2.9, while those for RNA were: 3.8%+/-0.5, 19.3%+/-2.1, and 54.3%+/-1.8, respectively. The deletions of one nucleotide were the most frequent errors. In the replication analysis, a significant difference was found in old versus young individuals for the ATRX (T)13. In the transcription analysis, significantly higher error rates were obtained in old versus young individuals for the TPRD (A)8 and TGFBR2 (A)10. For these genes, the error rate in RNA isolated from fibroblasts was significantly higher than that in blood. The data show a trend of age-related increase in replication/transcription errors; however further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis, since the sample size is small. This imperfect fidelity of the gene expression process may explain the evolutionary disadvantage of nucleotide repeats within coding sequences, and that these repeats are targets for mutations in human diseases.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11479734&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mercader, M</author><author>Nickoloff, B J</author><author>Foreman, K E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Induction of human immunodeficiency virus 1 replication by human herpesvirus 8.</title><secondary-title>Archives of pathology &amp; laboratory medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Archives of pathology &amp; laboratory medicine</full-title><abbr-1>Archives of pathology &amp; laboratory medicine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>785-789</pages><volume>125</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>B-Lymphocytes/virology</keyword><keyword>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/transplantation</keyword><keyword>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Herpesviridae Infections/complications</keyword><keyword>Herpesviridae Infections/virology</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 8, Human/*physiology</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections/complications</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections/virology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, SCID</keyword><keyword>Skin Transplantation</keyword><keyword>Superinfection/virology</keyword><keyword>Transplantation, Heterologous</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/*physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0003-9985</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5858/2001-125-0785-IOHIVR</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals are commonly infected with herpesviruses, including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8, also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [KSHV]). Previous studies have demonstrated that coinfection with herpesviruses can modulate HIV-1 replication. This can occur either through direct interaction between the 2 viruses or through secondary effects resulting from the release of cellular factors in response to infection.; Objective: To investigate HIV-1 replication in the presence and absence of HHV-8.; Design and Methods: HIV-1 replication was analyzed following culture of HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells in the presence of HHV-8 infected B-cell lines or control, uninfected B-cell lines. To confirm and extend the results of these in vitro studies, HIV-1-infected T cells were injected into human skin transplanted onto severe combined immunodeficient mice. The human skin was also injected with purified HHV-8 or phosphate-buffered saline as a control and HIV replication measured in biopsy specimens taken 5 to 8 days later.; Results and Conclusions: The results demonstrated a significant increase in HIV-1 replication in the presence of HHV-8 in both the in vitro and in vivo model systems. Although the mechanism responsible for HHV-8 induction of HIV-1 replication remains to be identified, the results indicate that these 2 viruses may interact at the molecular level in coinfected patients, resulting in increased HIV-1 viral load.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11371231&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hjort, K</author><author>Bernander, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell cycle regulation in the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.</title><secondary-title>Molecular microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Molecular microbiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>225-234</pages><volume>40</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Cycle*</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius/*cytology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0950-382X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02377.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The regulation and co-ordination of the cell cycle of the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius was investigated with antibiotics. We provide evidence for a core regulation involving alternating rounds of chromosome replication and genome segregation. In contrast, multiple rounds of replication of the chromosome could occur in the absence of an intervening cell division event. Inhibition of the elongation stage of chromosome replication resulted in cell division arrest, indicating that pathways similar to checkpoint mechanisms in eukaryotes, and the SOS system of bacteria, also exist in archaea. Several antibiotics induced cell cycle arrest in the G2 stage. Analysis of the run-out kinetics of chromosome replication during the treatments allowed estimation of the minimal rate of replication fork movement in vivo to 250 bp s-1. An efficient method for the production of synchronized Sulfolobus populations by transient daunomycin treatment is presented, providing opportunities for studies of cell cycle-specific events. Possible targets for the antibiotics are discussed, including topoisomerases and protein glycosylation.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11298289&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amiel, A</author><author>Elis, A</author><author>Sherker, S</author><author>Gaber, E</author><author>Manor, Y</author><author>Fejgin, M D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The influence of cytogenetic aberrations on gene replication in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.</title><secondary-title>Cancer genetics and cytogenetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer genetics and cytogenetics</full-title><abbr-1>Cancer genetics and cytogenetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>81-86</pages><volume>125</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Aberrations*</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Deletion</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>DNA, Neoplasm/genetics</keyword><keyword>Genes, erbB-2</keyword><keyword>Genes, myc</keyword><keyword>Genes, p53</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology</keyword><keyword>Trisomy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0165-4608</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00373-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in humans, with the major cytogenetic aberrations of trisomy 12 and deletion of 13q14. This study examined the influence of these aberrations on general gene replication. The study group included three subgroups: (1) 15 CLL patients, (2) 4 CLL patients with trisomy 12, (3) 3 CLL patients with deletions in 13q14. Five healthy individuals served as a control group. Monocolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes for c-myc, HER-2/neu, and p53 was applied to lymphocyte nuclei for the evaluation of replication timing. Asynchronous replication (SD) rate was significantly higher in all CLL patients (P &lt; 0.01) when compared to the control group and was even higher in the group of CLL patients with trisomy 12 and 13q14 deletion (P &lt; 0.01). The asynchrony rate was significantly higher in cells with trisomy 12 for all three probes analyzed, compared to "healthy" cells in the same patients (P &lt; 0.001). To conclude, in CLL patients with a chromosomal aberration such as trisomy 12 and 13q14 deletion we were able to demonstrate a high rate of asynchrony of replication. The high correlation between cells with trisomy 12 and SD pattern could reflect direct influence of the aberration on gene replication and cell cycle control.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11369050&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Smit, A J</author><author>Bouma, A</author><author>van Gennip, H G</author><author>de Kluijver, E P</author><author>Moormann, R J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chimeric (marker) C-strain viruses induce clinical protection against virulent classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and reduce transmission of CSFV between vaccinated pigs.</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title><abbr-1>Vaccine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1467-1476</pages><volume>19</volume><number>11-12</number><issue>11-12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Chimera/genetics</keyword><keyword>Chimera/immunology</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever Virus/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever Virus/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever Virus/pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever/immunology</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever/transmission</keyword><keyword>Genetic Markers</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Vaccination/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Vaccines, Synthetic/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Viral Vaccines/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Virulence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-01-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0264-410X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0264-410x(00)00347-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Two live recombinant vaccines (Flc9 and Flc11) against classical swine fever (CSF) were evaluated for their capacity to reduce transmission of virulent CSF virus (CSFV) among vaccinated pigs. In Flc9 the 5' terminal half of the E2 gene of the C-strain, a CSFV vaccine strain, was exchanged with the homologous gene of the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) strain 5250, the E(rns) gene was exchanged likewise in the chimeric Flc11 virus. Both recombinant vaccines induce an antibody response in pigs that can be distinguished from that induced after a wild-type CSFV infection. Four experiments were performed to estimate the reproduction ratio R after different vaccination-challenge intervals. Each group consisted of ten pigs [specified pathogen free (SPF) pigs or conventional pigs] that were vaccinated once, intramuscularly, either with Flc9 or Flc11 virus or that were not vaccinated. Vaccinated and susceptible pigs were challenged intranasally with the virulent CSFV strain Brescia or Behring, 1, 2 or 4 weeks after vaccination. Whether contact-pigs became infected was determined using a CSFV specific E2 (Flc9) or E(rns) (FLc11) antibody ELISA. In the unvaccinated control groups, virus secretion started from day 2 to 4 after inoculation and all contact pigs became infected. Contact pigs became infected in the group of pigs (SPF or conventional) vaccinated once with Flc9 virus and challenged 1-, 2- or 4-weeks later. The estimates of the R in the groups challenged at 1-, 2- and 4-weeks after vaccination were 0.38, 0 and 0.75, respectively. Contact infected pigs were not detected (R=0) in any of the groups of pigs, vaccinated with Flc11, only SPF pigs were used. In order to achieve a statistical significance of R within the vaccinated groups each of the experiments has to be repeated at least once. The R of pigs vaccinated with Flc11 virus and challenged at 1- or 2-weeks after vaccination was however significantly lower that the reproduction ratio of the unvaccinated groups (P=0.013). The R of pigs vaccinated with Flc9 virus and challenged at 1 (conventional pigs) or 2 weeks (SPF pigs) after vaccination was significantly lower that the reproduction ratio of the unvaccinated groups (P=0.013). In conclusion, both chimeric viruses Flc9 and Flc11 provided good clinical protection against a challenge with virulent CSFV at 1 or 2 weeks after vaccination. Further experiments should be carried out to study more aspects of the efficacy of these recombinant viruses before they can be used as a marker vaccine under field circumstances.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11163670&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Andreeva, E R</author><author>Orekhov, A N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of cell proliferation in human atherosclerotic lesions.</title><secondary-title>Methods in molecular medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Methods in molecular medicine</full-title><abbr-1>Methods in molecular medicine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>213-218</pages><volume>52</volume><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1543-1894</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1385/1-59259-073-X:213</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Local accumulation of cells (hypercellularity) in the intima of the arterial wall is recognized as one of the major manifestations of human atherosclerosis, which may result from local cell proliferation (1-3). This assumption was raised both on the comparative analysis of cell number in nondiseased and atherosclerotic areas of human arteries (3-5) and on the basis of the analysis of cell replication in experimental atherosclerosis (for review see ref. 1). In experimental atherosclerosis, cell replication was identified in several models, including mechanical injury of the arteries and experimental hypercholesterolemia. The experimental approach permits the direct determination of DNA replication using radiolabeled precursor-[(3)H]-thymidine, but it is impossible to demonstrate proliferation in human vessels directly, using standard procedures with labeling of replicating DNA. Villaschi and coworkers (6) labeled human arteries with [(3)H]-thymidine-ex vivo. They found a low level of replication in both grossly normal tissues and atherosclerotic plaques. In the case of ex vivo labeling, the questions of diffusion and of thymidine incorporation into ex vivo incubated tissue (6) make it difficult to be sure that this procedure reflects replication rates in vivo. Use of proliferation-specific antibodies is advantageous, since proliferating cells are detected directly. Antibodies to the cell-cycle related protein, PCNA (cyclin), are now commonly used in the study of human tissues (7-12). PCNA is an auxiliary protein of mammalian DNA polymerase-Î´ and is a stable cell-cycle-regulated nuclear protein (synthesized mainly in the S-phase but also present in G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle), the presence of which correlates directly with a proliferative state of normal cells (7-9).</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21340945&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moilanen, J S</author><author>Majamaa, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relative fitness of carriers of the mitochondrial DNA mutation 3243A &gt; G.</title><secondary-title>European journal of human genetics : EJHG</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European journal of human genetics : EJHG</full-title><abbr-1>European journal of human genetics : EJHG</abbr-1></periodical><pages>59-62</pages><volume>9</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Deafness/genetics</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heterozygote*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>MELAS Syndrome/genetics</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Reproduction</keyword><keyword>Selection, Genetic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1018-4813</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200550</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Deleterious point mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been found in many human populations and always at a low frequency suggesting that they are under strong negative selection.

We estimated the reproductive disadvantage caused by the mitochondrial DNA mutation 3243A &gt; G in a population-based group of female carriers (n = 32). The person-years method, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and population statistics were used to estimate net reproduction rates of the mutation carriers and the general population. We found that women with 3243A &gt; G reproduced at the same rate as women in the general population, suggesting that on average host-level selection against women harbouring the 3243A &gt; G mutation is not strong.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11175302&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imamichi, T</author><author>Berg, S C</author><author>Imamichi, H</author><author>Lopez, J C</author><author>Metcalf, J A</author><author>Falloon, J</author><author>Lane, H C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relative replication fitness of a high-level 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine-resistant variant of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 possessing an amino acid deletion at codon 67 and a novel substitution (Thr--&gt;Gly) at codon 69.</title><secondary-title>Journal of virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of virology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of virology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>10958-10964</pages><volume>74</volume><number>23</number><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Codon*</keyword><keyword>Gene Deletion</keyword><keyword>HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword><keyword>Zidovudine/*pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-538X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/jvi.74.23.10958-10964.2000</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The combination of an amino acid deletion at codon 67 (delta 67) and Thr-to-Gly change at codon 69 (T69G) in the reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with high-level resistance to multiple RT inhibitors. To determine the relative contributions of the delta 67 and T69G mutations on viral fitness, we performed a series of studies of HIV replication using recombinant variants. A high-level 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT)-resistant variant containing delta 67 plus T69G/K70R/L74I/K103N/T215F/K219Q in RT replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus (Wt). In contrast, the construct without delta 67 exhibited impaired replication (23% of growth of Wt). A competitive fitness study failed to reveal any differences in replication rates between the delta 67+T69G/K70R/L74I/K103N/T215F/+ ++K219Q mutant and Wt. Evaluation of proviral DNA sequences over a 3-year period in a patient harboring the multiresistant HIV revealed that the T69G mutation emerged in the context of a D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant backbone prior to appearance of the delta 67 deletion. To assess the impact of this stepwise accumulation of mutations on viral replication, a series of recombinant variants was constructed and analyzed for replication competence. The T69G mutation was found to confer 2',3'-dideoxyinosine resistance at the expense of fitness. Subsequently, the development of the delta 67 deletion led to a virus with improved replication and high-level AZT resistance.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11069990&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abkowitz, J L</author><author>Golinelli, D</author><author>Harrison, D E</author><author>Guttorp, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vivo kinetics of murine hemopoietic stem cells.</title><secondary-title>Blood</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Blood</full-title><abbr-1>Blood</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3399-3405</pages><volume>96</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Congenic/blood</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Bone Marrow Transplantation</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Hematopoiesis</keyword><keyword>Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology</keyword><keyword>Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological*</keyword><keyword>Monte Carlo Method</keyword><keyword>Stochastic Processes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-11-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-4971</isbn><abstract>We used stochastic modeling and computer simulation to study the replication, apoptosis, and differentiation of murine hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vivo. This approach allows description of the behavior of an unobserved population (ie, HSCs) on the basis of the behavior of observed progeny cells (ie, granulocytes and lymphocytes). The results of previous limiting-dilution, competitive-repopulation studies in 44 mice were compared with the results of simulated transplantation studies to identify parameters that led to comparable outcomes. Using this approach, we estimated that murine HSCs replicate (on average) once every 2.5 weeks and that the frequency of murine HSCs is 8 per 10(5) nucleated marrow cells. If it is assumed that short-term repopulating cells are distinct from HSCs, that they contribute to hemopoiesis early after transplantation, and that they are independently regulated, a frequency of 4 HSCs per 10(5) nucleated marrow cells also allows simulations that best approximate the observed data. When stochastic modeling and computer simulation were applied to limiting-dilution, autologous-transplantation studies in cats heterozygous for glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, different estimates of HSC replication rate (1 per 8.3-10 weeks) and frequency (6 per 10(7) cells) were derived. Therefore, it appears that these parameters vary inversely with increased longevity, size, or both. An implication of these data is that human HSCs may be less frequent and replicate more slowly. These findings on cell kinetics have several implications.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11071634&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shadmehr, R</author><author>Moussavi, Z M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial generalization from learning dynamics of reaching movements.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</abbr-1></periodical><pages>7807-7815</pages><volume>20</volume><number>20</number><issue>20</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Arm/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Distance Perception/physiology</keyword><keyword>Electromyography</keyword><keyword>Hand/physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Joints/physiology</keyword><keyword>Learning/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological</keyword><keyword>Motor Skills/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Muscle, Skeletal/physiology</keyword><keyword>Pilot Projects</keyword><keyword>Psychomotor Performance/physiology</keyword><keyword>Space Perception/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Torque</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-10-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1529-2401</isbn><abstract>When subjects practice reaching movements in a force field, they learn a new sensorimotor map that associates desired trajectories to motor commands. The map is formed in the brain with elements that allow for generalization beyond the region of training. We quantified spatial generalization properties of these elements by training in one extreme of the reachable space and testing near another. Training resulted in rotations in the preferred direction (PD) of activation of some arm muscles. We designed force fields that maintained a constant rotation in muscle PDs as the shoulder joint rotated in the horizontal plane. In such fields, training in a small region resulted in generalization to near and far work spaces (80 cm). In one such field, the forces on the hand reversed directions for a given hand velocity with respect to the location of original training. Despite this, there was generalization. However, if the field was such that the change in the muscle PDs reversed as the work spaces changed, then performance was worse than performance of naive subjects. We suggest that the sensorimotor map of arm dynamics is represented in the brain by elements that globally encode the position of the arm but locally encode its velocity. The elements have preferred directions of movement but are modulated globally by the position of the shoulder joint. We suggest that tuning properties of cells in the motor system influence behavior and that this influence is reflected in the way that we learn dynamics of reaching movements.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11027245&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>GarcÃ­a-Lerma, J G</author><author>Gerrish, P J</author><author>Wright, A C</author><author>Qari, S H</author><author>Heneine, W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence of a role for the Q151L mutation and the viral background in development of multiple dideoxynucleoside-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1.</title><secondary-title>Journal of virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of virology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of virology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>9339-9346</pages><volume>74</volume><number>20</number><issue>20</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Didanosine/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance</keyword><keyword>HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*physiology</keyword><keyword>HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis, Site-Directed</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword><keyword>Zalcitabine/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Zidovudine/pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-538X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/jvi.74.20.9339-9346.2000</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The majority of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients treated with zidovudine (AZT) plus zalcitabine (ddC) and didanosine (ddI) develop AZT resistance mediated by mutations such as T215Y and M41L. Only a small proportion of patients develop multiple dideoxynucleoside resistance (MDNR) mediated by the Q151M mutation. To gain insight into the factors responsible for the low frequency of selection of Q151M, we evaluated the replication capabilities of recombinant viruses carrying two possible intermediates (151L or 151K) of the Q151M mutation generated in different reverse transcriptase (RT) genetic backgrounds. The 151L and 151K mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in RTs from two patient-derived HIV-1 isolates that had either wild type (WT) Q or the Q151M (posttreatment isolate) mutation. For comparison, both mutations were also introduced in a laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain (HIV-1(HXB2)). Analysis of replication capabilities showed that both 151L and 151K were lethal in RT genetic backgrounds of the WT isolate and in HIV-1(HXB2). In contrast, 151L but not 151K allowed virus replication in RT backgrounds of the posttreatment isolate. Three mutations (V35I, S68G, and I178M) were present in the RT background of the posttreatment isolate but not in the WT isolate. Introduction of S68G in the RT of both the WT isolate and HIV-1(HXB2) partially restored replication capacity of recombinants carrying the 151L mutation. The S68G mutation alone did not confer a significant replicative disadvantage in WT viruses. Like HIV-1(151M), HIV-1(151L) RT was found to have six- to eightfold resistance to AZT-triphosphate (TP), ddA-TP, and ddC-TP, indicating an MDNR phenotype. However, HIV-1(151L) was found to be less fit than HIV-1(151M), which may explain the preferential selection of HIV-1(151M) observed in vivo. The demonstrated ability of HIV-1(151L/68G) to replicate and the associated MDNR suggest that 151L is a potential intermediate of Q151M. The dependence of HIV-1(151L) on other mutations, such as S68G, for replication may explain the low frequency of the Q151M-mediated pathway of resistance.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11000201&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De, B P</author><author>Hoffman, M A</author><author>Choudhary, S</author><author>Huntley, C C</author><author>Banerjee, A K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of NH(2)- and COOH-terminal domains of the P protein of human parainfluenza virus type 3 in transcription and replication.</title><secondary-title>Journal of virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of virology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of virology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5886-5895</pages><volume>74</volume><number>13</number><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Viral*</keyword><keyword>Genome, Viral</keyword><keyword>HeLa Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis</keyword><keyword>Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure, Tertiary</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral</keyword><keyword>Templates, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Transcription, Genetic*</keyword><keyword>Viral Proteins/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Viral Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Viral Proteins/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-538X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/jvi.74.13.5886-5895.2000</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The phosphoproteins (P proteins) of paramyxoviruses play a central role in transcription and replication of the viruses by forming the RNA polymerase complex L-P and encapsidation complex (N-P) with nucleocapsid protein (N) and binding to N protein-encapsidated genome RNA template (N-RNA template). We have analyzed the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) P protein and deletion mutants thereof in an in vitro transcription and in vivo replication system. The in vitro system utilizes purified N-RNA template and cell extract containing L and P proteins coexpressed via plasmids using a recombinant vaccinia virus expression system. The in vivo system takes advantage of minigenome replication, which measures luciferase reporter gene expression from HPIV3 minigenomes by viral proteins in a recombinant vaccinia virus expression system. These studies revealed that the C-terminal 20-amino-acid region of P is absolutely required for transcription in vitro and luciferase expression in vivo, suggesting its critical role in viral RNA synthesis. The N-terminal 40-amino-acid region, on the other hand, is essential for luciferase expression but dispensable for transcription in vitro. Consistent with these findings, the C-terminal domain is required for binding of P protein to the N-RNA template involved in both transcription and replication, whereas the N-terminal domain is required for the formation of soluble N-P complex involved in encapsidation of nascent RNA chains during replication. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that the P protein forms a stable homooligomer (perhaps a trimer) that is present in L-P and N-P complexes in the higher oligomeric forms (at least a pentamer). Interestingly, coexpression of a large excess of N- or C-terminally deleted P with wild-type P had no effect on minigenome replication in vivo, notwithstanding the formation of heterooligomeric complexes. These data indicate that P protein with a deleted terminal domain can function normally within the P heterooligomeric complex to carry out transcription and replication in vivo.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10846069&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kakizaki, S</author><author>Takagi, H</author><author>Horiguchi, N</author><author>Toyoda, M</author><author>Takayama, H</author><author>Nagamine, T</author><author>Mori, M</author><author>Kato, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Iron enhances hepatitis C virus replication in cultured human hepatocytes.</title><secondary-title>Liver</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Liver</full-title><abbr-1>Liver</abbr-1></periodical><pages>125-128</pages><volume>20</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Line, Transformed</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Coloring Agents/metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Hepacivirus/*growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Hepacivirus/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Hepacivirus/genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Iron/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Liver/*virology</keyword><keyword>Liver/cytology</keyword><keyword>Liver/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/analysis</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Thiazoles/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*/genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0106-9543</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1034/j.1600-0676.2000.020002125.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Iron overload in the presence of increasing concentrations of iron is one of the indicators of poor response to interferon therapy in chronic hepatitis C. In order to analyze the effect of iron on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, we measured replication in an HCV-infected cell line.; Methods and Results: Cells from a non-neoplastic HCV-infected human hepatocyte line (PH5CH8) susceptible to HCV infection and supportive of HCV replication were used in this study. The replication of HCV RNA was measured by reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested PCR). PH5CH8 cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. PH5CH8 cells were incubated with 0, 1, 10, 50, and 100 microM of FeSO4 at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2. Forty-eight hours after iron supplementation, the quantity of HCV RNA in the cells incubated in 50 and 100 microM of FeSO4 was approximately ten times that of the cells with no iron supplementation. Similar changes were observed beginning at 12 h from supplementation with FeSO4 and continued for at least 72 h after supplementation. MTT assay indicated that iron did not have cytotoxic effects on the PH5CH8 cells.; Conclusion: Iron enhances HCV replication in a hepatocyte cell line. The results suggest that iron deposition in hepatocytes could facilitate HCV infection in the liver.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10847480&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Y L</author><author>Liu, C C</author><author>Lei, H Y</author><author>Yeh, T M</author><author>Lin, Y S</author><author>Chen, R M</author><author>Liu, H S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Infection of five human liver cell lines by dengue-2 virus.</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of medical virology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>425-431</pages><volume>60</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Alanine Transaminase/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Aspartate Aminotransferases/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral</keyword><keyword>Dengue Virus/*pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Dengue Virus/genetics</keyword><keyword>Dengue Virus/physiology</keyword><keyword>Dengue/enzymology</keyword><keyword>Dengue/virology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0146-6615</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/(sici)1096-9071(200004)60:4&lt;425::aid-jmv10&gt;3.0.co;2-a</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Elevated serum transaminase levels of dengue patients indicate the possible impact of dengue virus infection on liver function. To elucidate the action of dengue virus infection in liver cells, an in vitro cell line system was established that mimicked the liver status of diverse clinical patients. Briefly, four hepatoma cell lines (HA22T, Huh7, Hep3B, and PLC) and one nonmalignant hepatocyte cell line (Chang liver) were included, representing various levels of tumorigenicity and differentiation. Our data showed that in these five cell lines, dengue-2 virus attached to each cell type equally well; however, this virus had higher replication rates and levels of virion production in differentiated Huh7, PLC, Hep3B, and Chang liver cells. Likewise, a lower replication rate was observed in the de-differentiated HA22T cells. Differentiation-related factors seem to play an important role in dengue virus replication. Further study showed that sodium butyrate (NaB, a differentiation inducer) treatment enhanced dengue virus replication in HA22T cells. Moreover, we found that the severity of morphologic aberration and the increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels correlated with the virus replication rate in the four infected hepatoma cells. In conclusion, we showed that dengue virus can infect diverse liver cells with differing replication efficiency, which causes cytopathic effects (CPEs) of diverse severity. Among the CPEs, the increased AST levels correlated with the clinical results from 24 dengue fever patients, who showed increased AST levels at the onset of fever. In summary, we find that dengue-2 virus replicates actively and causes severe CPEs in differentiated hepatoma cells. Factors related to differentiation as well as tumorigenicity seem to play critical roles, though the mechanisms of action remain unclear.

Four experiments were performed: In experiment 1, the original selective breeding of rats for apomorphine susceptibility (leading to APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS rats) was extended and replicated in an independent group of Wistar rats. In experiment 2, APO-SUS males were cross-bred with APO-UNSUS females and vice versa. In experiment 3 APO-SUS litters were cross-fostered to APO-UNSUS mothers or infostered to unknown APO-SUS mothers and vice versa. In experiment 4 APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS rats were maternally deprived on postnatal day 9, for a single 24-h period.; Methods: Adult rats were subcutaneously injected with 1.5 mg/kg apomorphine and their gnawing response was automatically recorded in a gnawing box for 45 min.; Results: In experiment 1, the original breeding was extended up to generation 24, leading to a strong and consistent difference in gnawing scores. The replication experiment also succeeded in differentiating APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS. The cross breeding experiments showed that the APO-SUS/UNSUS offspring showed gnawing scores in between the original selection lines. Cross-fostering APO-SUS with APO-UNSUS significantly reduced the gnawing response in the offspring, whereas it did not affect the gnawing score in the APO-UNSUS animals. Maternal deprivation had the opposite effect: increase in gnawing response in APO-UNSUS, with no effect in APO-SUS.; Conclusion: The results show a clear-cut contribution of both genetic and early environmental factors to the susceptibility of apomorphine.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10663426&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bouma, A</author><author>De Smit, A J</author><author>De Jong, M C</author><author>De Kluijver, E P</author><author>Moormann, R J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determination of the onset of the herd-immunity induced by the E2 sub-unit vaccine against classical swine fever virus.</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title><abbr-1>Vaccine</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1374-1381</pages><volume>18</volume><number>14</number><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever Virus/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever/*prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever/immunology</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever/transmission</keyword><keyword>Classical Swine Fever/virology</keyword><keyword>Immunization Schedule</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology</keyword><keyword>Viral Vaccines/*therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Viral Vaccines/immunology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-01-31</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0264-410X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0264-410x(99)00398-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>For a recently developed E2 subunit vaccine against classical swine fever (CSF), the reduction in transmission, at different moments after vaccination, was assessed by animal experiments and statistical calculations. Two experiments were performed to estimate the reproduction ratio R. Experiment 1 consisted of three groups and experiment 2 of two groups each of 10 pigs. In four of these groups, all pigs were vaccinated intramuscularly with the vaccine. The pigs in the fifth group remained unvaccinated (control group). After treatment, half of each group was intranasally inoculated with the virulent CSFV strain Brescia. In the vaccine groups, the following vaccination-challenge intervals were applied: 14, 14, 10, and 7 days, respectively. The occurrence of (contact-) infection was determined using the E(rns) ELISA. In the 7-days interval group and in the control group, virus transmission to all contact pigs occurred, indicating R1. Neither in the two 2-week interval groups nor in the 10-day interval group did contact-infections occur. Hence, the estimated R is less than one, which indicates that an epidemic would fade out. Therefore, the E2 subunit vaccine may be an efficacious tool in a control program during an outbreak of CSF as from 10 days after vaccination.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10618535&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MÃ¼ller, K</author><author>Mermod, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The histone-interacting domain of nuclear factor I activates simian virus 40 DNA replication in vivo.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of biological chemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1645-1650</pages><volume>275</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carrier Proteins/metabolism</keyword><keyword>CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins*</keyword><keyword>Chromatin/metabolism</keyword><keyword>COS Cells</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Histones/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>NFI Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Organic Cation Transport Proteins*</keyword><keyword>Organic Cation Transporter 2</keyword><keyword>Plasmids/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Point Mutation</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure, Tertiary</keyword><keyword>Simian virus 40/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Simian virus 40/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors/genetics</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transcriptional Activation*</keyword><keyword>Y-Box-Binding Protein 1</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-01-21</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9258</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.275.3.1645</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Efficient initiation of SV40 DNA replication requires transcription factors that bind auxiliary sequences flanking the minimally required origin. To evaluate the possibility that transcription factors may activate SV40 replication by acting on the chromatin structure of the origin, we used an in vivo replication system in which we targeted GAL4 fusion proteins to the minimally required origin. We found that the proline-rich transcriptional activation domain of nuclear factor I (NF-I), which has been previously shown to interact with histone H3, specifically activates replication. Evaluation of a series of deletion and point mutants of NF-I indicates that the H3-binding domain and the replication activity coincide perfectly. Assays with other transcription factors, such as Sp1, confirmed the correlation between the interaction with H3 and the activation of replication. These findings imply that transcription factors such as NF-I can activate SV40 replication via direct interaction with chromatin components, thereby contributing to the relief of nucleosomal repression at the SV40 origin.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10636857&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Timsit, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DNA structure and polymerase fidelity.</title><secondary-title>Journal of molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of molecular biology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of molecular biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>835-853</pages><volume>293</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Pairing/genetics</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Binding Sites/genetics</keyword><keyword>Crystallization</keyword><keyword>DNA Polymerase beta/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Polymerase beta/chemistry</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers/metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication/*genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA/*biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>DNA/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>DNA/genetics</keyword><keyword>Frameshift Mutation/genetics</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Bonding</keyword><keyword>Models, Chemical</keyword><keyword>Models, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Conformation*</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Sequence Deletion/genetics</keyword><keyword>Templates, Genetic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999-11-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-2836</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1006/jmbi.1999.3199</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The accuracy of DNA replication results from both the intrinsic DNA polymerase fidelity and the DNA sequence. Although the recent structural studies on polymerases have brought new insights on polymerase fidelity, the role of DNA sequence and structure is less well understood. Here, the analysis of the crystal structures of hotspots for polymerase slippage including (CA)n and (A)n tracts in different intermolecular contexts reveals that, in the B-form, these sequences share common structural alterations which may explain the high rate of replication errors. In particular, a two-faced "Janus-like" structure with shifted base-pairs in the major groove but an apparent normal geometry in the minor groove constitutes a molecular decoy specifically suitable to mislead the polymerases. A model of the rat polymerase beta bound to this structure suggests that an altered conformation of the nascent template-primer duplex can interfere with correct nucleotide incorporation by affecting the geometry of the active site and breaking the rules of base-pairing, while at the same time escaping enzymatic mechanisms of error discrimination which scan for the correct geometry of the minor groove.In contrast, by showing that the A-form greatly attenuates the sequence-dependent structural alterations in hotspots, this study suggests that the A-conformation of the nascent template-primer duplex at the vicinity of the polymerase active site will contribute to fidelity. The A-form may play the role of a structural buffer which preserves the correct geometry of the active site for all sequences. The detailed comparison of the conformation of the nascent template-primer duplex in the available crystal structures of DNA polymerase-DNA complexes shows that polymerase beta, the least accurate enzyme, is unique in binding to a B-DNA duplex even close to its active site. This model leads to several predictions which are discussed in the light of published experimental data.

On the basis of the new model to characterize the dissolution profile by the distribution function of the random dissolution time of a drug molecule, which generalizes the classical first order model.; Methods: Instead of assuming a constant fractional dissolution rate, as in the classical model, it is considered that the fractional dissolution rate is a decreasing function of the dissolved amount controlled by the dose-solubility ratio. The differential equation derived from this assumption is solved and the distribution measures (half-dissolution time, mean dissolution time, relative dispersion of the dissolution time, dissolution time density, and fractional dissolution rate) are calculated. Finally, instead of monotonically decreasing the fractional dissolution rate, a generalization resulting in zero dissolution rate at time origin is introduced.; Results: The behavior of the model is divided into two regions defined by q, the ratio of the dose to the solubility level: q &lt; 1 (complete dissolution of the dose, dissolution time) and q &gt; 1 (saturation of the solution, saturation time). The singular case q = 1 is also treated and in this situation the mean as well as the relative dispersion of the dissolution time increase to infinity. The model was successfully fitted to data (1).; Conclusions: This empirical model is descriptive without detailed physical reasoning behind its derivation. According to the model, the mean dissolution time is affected by the dose-solubility ratio. Although this prediction appears to be in accordance with preliminary application, further validation based on more suitable experimental data is required.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10496667&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gay-Andrieu, F</author><author>Cozon, G J</author><author>Ferrandiz, J</author><author>Kahi, S</author><author>Peyron, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Flow cytometric quantification of Toxoplasma gondii cellular infection and replication.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of parasitology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of parasitology</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of parasitology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>545-549</pages><volume>85</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain/*parasitology</keyword><keyword>Brain/cytology</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelium/cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium/parasitology</keyword><keyword>Flow Cytometry*</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Saimiri</keyword><keyword>Toxoplasma/*physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-3395</isbn><abstract>The invasion and replication of Toxoplasma gondii are usually analyzed through either optical microscopy or incorporation of tritiated uracil. A new method has been developed using flow cytometric analysis to examine the entry and replication of T. gondii RH strain in Saimiri brain endothelial cells. After cell fixation and permeabilization using saponin, intracellular T. gondii were labeled with a monoclonal antibody against T. gondii SAG-1 (P30; the major cell-surface antigen) followed by fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The percentage of infected cells obtained using flow cytometry correlated directly with that obtained by UV light microscopy (r = 0.97). The mean fluorescence intensity of infected cells reflects intracellular P30 and assesses intracellular replication. The distribution of fluorescence per infected cell, considered with the percentage of infected cells, also allows a qualitative analysis of replication. Such a method is rapid, easy, and does not require specialized equipment for radioactive labeling.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10386451&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MackiewiczP</author><author>Gierlik, A</author><author>Kowalczuk, M</author><author>Dudek, M R</author><author>Cebrat, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How does replication-associated mutational pressure influence amino acid composition of proteins?</title><secondary-title>Genome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome research</full-title><abbr-1>Genome research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>409-416</pages><volume>9</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence/*genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication/*genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA/genetics</keyword><keyword>Mutation/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Prokaryotic Cells/chemistry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1088-9051</isbn><abstract>We have performed detrended DNA walks on whole prokaryotic genomes, on noncoding sequences and, separately, on each position in codons of coding sequences. Our method enables us to distinguish between the mutational pressure associated with replication and the mutational pressure associated with transcription and other mechanisms that introduce asymmetry into prokaryotic chromosomes. In many prokaryotic genomes, each component of mutational pressure affects coding sequences not only in silent positions but also in positions in which changes cause amino acid substitutions in coded proteins. Asymmetry in the silent positions of codons differentiates the rate of translation of mRNA produced from leading and lagging strands. Asymmetry in the amino acid composition of proteins resulting from replication-associated mutational pressure also corresponds to leading and lagging roles of DNA strands, whereas asymmetry connected with transcription and coding function corresponds to the distance of genes from the origin or terminus of chromosome replication.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10330120&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, E O</author><author>Breslau, N</author><author>Roth, T</author><author>Roehrs, T</author><author>Rosenthal, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Psychometric evaluation of daytime sleepiness and nocturnal sleep onset scales in a representative community sample.</title><secondary-title>Biological psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biological psychiatry</full-title><abbr-1>Biological psychiatry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>764-770</pages><volume>45</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Circadian Rhythm/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Excessive Somnolence/*diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Psychometrics</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Sleep/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Wakefulness/physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999-03-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-3223</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0006-3223(98)00111-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The public health importance of daytime sleepiness as a risk factor for accidents, interpersonal problems, and decreased productivity has been recognized. However, epidemiologic research on this topic has been limited by the reliance on laboratory measures (i.e., the Multiple Sleep Latency Test-MSLT). Two scales, daytime sleepiness and nocturnal sleep onset, have been identified from the self-report Sleep-Wake Activity Inventory (SWAI) in a clinic sample and validated against the MSLT. This study evaluates the replicability of the two scales in a population sample and assesses potential thresholds in scale scores that distinguish normal from pathologic levels of daytime sleepiness and difficulty falling asleep.; Methods: The sample consisted of 2181 subjects 18-45 years old in the Detroit metropolitan area. All sleep characteristic information covered the 2 weeks prior to interview. Split-half sample factor analyses were conducted to assess replicability of the results. Distribution of scale scores and their relation to construct validity variables were used to evaluate possible thresholds.; Results: A two-factor model appeared to best account for the variation among the 12 items from the SWAI. The two factors accounted for 50% of the variance in both split-half sample analyses. The revised eight-item daytime sleepiness and two-item nocturnal sleep onset scales showed good and fair internal consistency respectively across both split-half samples. There appeared to be a "natural break" in daytime sleepiness scale scores that was associated with a substantial and consistent change in number of hours slept. No breaks appeared in nocturnal sleep onset scores.; Conclusions: This study replicated the results of the clinic-based study and suggested a potentially useful diagnostic threshold for self-report excessive daytime sleepiness. Epidemiology of sleep depends on the ability to move from the laboratory to population surveys in reliable and valid ways. Development of self-report is a step in that direction.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10188007&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerstiaens, A</author><author>Benfekih, L</author><author>Zouiten, H</author><author>Verhaert, P</author><author>De Loof, A</author><author>Schoofs, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Led-NPF-1 stimulates ovarian development in locusts.</title><secondary-title>Peptides</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Peptides</full-title><abbr-1>Peptides</abbr-1></periodical><pages>39-44</pages><volume>20</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diptera/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Grasshoppers/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Insect Proteins/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Neuropeptides/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Neuropeptides/chemical synthesis</keyword><keyword>Ovary/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Ovary/growth &amp; development</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0196-9781</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0196-9781(98)00152-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>For more than a decade, immunohistochemical results on FMRFamide related peptides (FaRP's) have been reported extensively, suggesting many possible roles for these peptides associated with behavioural and physiological events as well as reproduction. This study provides a clear effect in vivo of members of this family of insect neuropeptides. The effect of two neuropeptide F-related peptides from the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Led-NPF-1 and Led-NPF-2 as well as the locusts myotropins, Lom-PK-1, Lom-PK-2 and Lom-SK, was screened in an ovarian development assay in the African migratory locust and the grey fleshfly, Neobellieria bullata. Led-NPF-1 (Ala-Arg-Gly-Pro-Gln-Leu-Arg-Leu-Arg-Phe-NH2) was shown to be a potent gonadostimulin in Locusta migratoria, but not in Neobellieria bullata. A minimal dose of 0.05 microg of Led-NPF-1 per animal, every 12 h, during 5 consecutive injections into 6 day old virgin females, could accelerate egg development. Higher doses of prolonged injections were demonstrated to be even more potent in the ovarian development assay. Led-NPF-2 (Ala-Pro-Ser-Leu-Arg-Leu-Arg-Phe-NH2) was far less active. The other tested peptides scored no reproducible effect what so ever on ovarian growth, in locusts, nor in flies. The gonadotropic action of a NPF-like peptide on oocyte growth implies a complex regulation of oogenesis in the locust and adds to our knowledge of insect neuroendocrinology in general. The results also suggest that a peptide of similar sequence also resides in the locust.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=10098622&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lalli, J S</author><author>Mace, F C</author><author>Livezey, K</author><author>Kates, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of stimulus generalization gradients in the treatment of self-injurious behavior.</title><secondary-title>Journal of applied behavior analysis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of applied behavior analysis</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of applied behavior analysis</abbr-1></periodical><pages>479-483</pages><volume>31</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Behavior Therapy/*methods</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Extinction, Psychological</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mental Disorders/complications</keyword><keyword>Power, Psychological</keyword><keyword>Professional-Patient Relations</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement Schedule</keyword><keyword>Self-Injurious Behavior/*rehabilitation</keyword><keyword>Self-Injurious Behavior/etiology</keyword><keyword>Self-Injurious Behavior/psychology</keyword><keyword>Social Facilitation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-8855</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1901/jaba.1998.31-479</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Descriptive and experimental analyses suggested that the self-injurious behavior (SIB) of a 10-year-old girl with severe mental retardation was maintained by attention.

Based on these findings, we systematically varied the distance between the participant and a therapist to assess stimulus generalization. Results showed that rates of SIB varied relative to the distance between the participant and therapist; the highest percentage of SIB occurred with the therapist positioned less than 0.5 m from the participant.

At the beginning of this study she had minimal meaningful spoken output and showed little awareness of her speech despite having relatively well-preserved auditory comprehension. Her spoken output had proved resistant to earlier periods of therapy. In contrast, R.M.M.'s written output showed some ability to access orthographic information and monitoring of this modality was shown by an acute awareness of her errors. A 3-stage therapy programme is described. This was designed to improve R.M.M.'s writing of single words and to encourage use of writing as an alternative means of communication. The initial stage of therapy aimed to increase R.M.M.'s access to written word forms by use of picture stimuli. She showed significant improvement in writing treated items in response to pictures both immediately after therapy and at re-assessment 6 weeks later. Despite the acquisition of these skills, R.M.M. failed to use them in communicative contexts. A second stage of therapy replicated the results of the first and sought to facilitate R.M.M.'s functional use of her written vocabulary by asking her to write words to spoken questions. She again showed improved written naming of the treated items and could now produce written names appropriately in a questionnaire-type assessment. Generalization of this ability extended to items that had not been trained in this way. Functional use of writing in everyday communication remained absent, however. The final stage of therapy made explicit the potential links between items which R.M.M. could now write and functional messages which they might convey. She again showed significant changes in the acquisition of new vocabulary and, encouragingly, progress was also seen in her use of the strategy in functional communication. R.M.M.'s speech is almost entirely incomprehensible. It has remained unchanged for 2 years and has not responded to therapy. Relatively well-preserved auditory comprehension and good monitoring of written output allowed therapy to effectively target a small written vocabulary. Despite significant progress in the acquisition of new items, transfer of this skill to functional communication was initially absent.

In the present study, the ability of human monocyte-derived macrophages (M phi) to produce NO- in response to M phi modulators was tested. M phi cultured for up to nine days and stimulated for 48 with different concentrations of LPS and/or IFN-gamma failed to produce significant amounts of NO2- compared to unstimulated cultures. Inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway with indomethacin did not increase NO2- production by LPS stimulated M phi. Since human M phi lack biopterin, needed for NO- synthesis by murine M phi, human M phi stimulated with LPS plus IFN-gamma were additionally cultured in the presence of neopterin or biopterin. These treatments did not induce NO2- production. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment with indomethacin and neopterin or biopterin also failed to induce NO2- production. However, human M phi, stimulated with IFN-gamma and LPs, produced TNF-alpha suggesting that the lack of increment in NO2- production was not due to an absence of response of M phi to the stimuli used. As an indirect approach to explore the NO- production, human M phi were infected with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and simultaneously treated with the competitive inhibitor NGmonomethyl-L-arginine (NGMMA). Mycobacterial intracellular replication was measured by 3H-uracil incorporation. NGMMA did not have any effect on mycobacterial replication. These results further suggest that human M phi do not produce NO- at least by the inducible pathway.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=9469204&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dornburg, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From the natural evolution to the genetic manipulation of the host-range of retroviruses.</title><secondary-title>Biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biological chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>Biological chemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>457-468</pages><volume>378</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Evolution, Molecular*</keyword><keyword>Gene Products, env/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Gene Products, env/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Genetic Engineering*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Retroviridae/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Retroviridae/*genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997-06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1431-6730</isbn><abstract>The discovery that retroviruses share many features with retrotransposons led to the proposal that retroviruses evolved from cellular movable elements and became independent genetic entities, which started a parasitic life on their own. It has been further hypothesized that in the course of this evolutionary process, retrotransposons incorporated a cellular membrane glycoprotein gene into their genome, which finally became the envelope gene of the virus. Equipped with a error-prone polymerase and a high recombination rate during replication, the resulting genetic element has been equipped with a powerful machinery to change and modify itself, in particular the envelope gene, not only to escape the immune system, but also to change the host species. The HIV-1 epidemiology may serve as the best example of this still on-going evolutionary process. Since retroviruses insert their genome into that of the host cell as part of their life cycle, they have been extensively utilized as gene transfer vectors (retroviral vectors). Recently, experiments have been initiated to modify the envelope of retroviral vectors in the laboratory to alter the host range for specific gene transfer applications. This review highlights aspects of the natural evolution and the genetic modification of the retroviral envelope protein. Its implication on the safety of retroviral vectors in human gene therapy is also discussed.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=9224924&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berkhout, B</author><author>Klaver, B</author><author>Das, A T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forced evolution of a regulatory RNA helix in the HIV-1 genome.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic acids research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>940-947</pages><volume>25</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Directed Molecular Evolution*</keyword><keyword>Genome, Viral</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Conformation</keyword><keyword>Poly A</keyword><keyword>Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid*</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral*</keyword><keyword>Temperature</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997-03-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-1048</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/25.5.940</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The 5'and 3'end of the HIV-1 RNA genome forms a repeat (R) element that encodes a double stem-loop structure (the TAR and polyA hairpins). Phylogenetic analysis of the polyA hairpin in different human and simian immunodeficiency viruses suggests that the thermodynamic stability of the helix is fine-tuned. We demonstrated previously that mutant HIV-1 genomes with a stabilized or destabilized hairpin are severely replication-impaired. In this study, we found that the mutant with a destabilized polyA hairpin structure is conditionally defective. Whereas reduced replication is measured in infections at the regular temperature (37 degrees C), this mutant is more fit than the wild-type virus at reduced temperature (33 degrees C). This observation of a temperature-dependent replication defect underscores that the stability of this RNA structure is critical for function. An extensive analysis of revertant viruses was performed to further improve the understanding of the critical sequence and structural features of the element under scrutiny. The virus mutants with a stabilized or destabilized hairpin were used as a starting point in multiple, independent selections for revertant viruses with compensatory mutations. Both mutants reverted to hairpins with wild-type stability along various pathways by acquisition of compensatory mutations. We identified 19 different revertant HIV-1 forms with improved replication characteristics, providing a first look at some of the peaks in the total sequence landscape that are compatible with virus replication. These experiments also highlight some general principles of RNA structure building.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=9023102&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, R D</author><author>Guan, M</author><author>Park, Y</author><author>Tawadros, R</author><author>Yang, J Y</author><author>Gold, B</author><author>Wu, B</author><author>Henderson, E E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Synergy between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and Epstein-Barr virus in T lymphoblastoid cell lines.</title><secondary-title>AIDS research and human retroviruses</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AIDS research and human retroviruses</full-title><abbr-1>AIDS research and human retroviruses</abbr-1></periodical><pages>161-171</pages><volume>13</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line, Transformed</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/analysis</keyword><keyword>Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/genetics</keyword><keyword>Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/physiology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Viral</keyword><keyword>Gene Products, tat</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV Long Terminal Repeat</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*physiology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Complement 3d/genetics</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Complement 3d/immunology</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Complement 3d/physiology</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Virus/genetics</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Virus/immunology</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Virus/physiology</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger</keyword><keyword>tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus</keyword><keyword>Transcriptional Activation</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997-01-20</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0889-2229</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/aid.1997.13.161</electronic-resource-num><abstract>CR2 (CD21), the EBV receptor, was detected on three of four CD4-positive cell lines by indirect fluorescent labeling, and its corresponding mRNA was found by use of the reverse transcription-based polymerase chain reaction. To determine whether CR2 on CD4-positive cells was functional, their ability to be infected by EBV was analyzed. EBV DNA, EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2A), and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER1) transcripts could be detected in CR2-expressing CD4-positive cells following infection by the B95.8 strain of EBV. Analysis of the terminal region showed the EBV genome remained linear following infection, and copy number decreased with time. Since CD4-positive cell lines are targets for HIV-1 infection, the effects of EBV infection on HIV-1 expression were analyzed. HIV-1 replication was upregulated when CD4-positive cells were coinfected with EBV strain B95.8 but not P3HR-1K. These results suggested that EBNA-2 is involved in upregulation of HIV-1 expression in T lymphoblastoid cell lines. To test this hypothesis an EBNA-2-expression vector was transfected into T lymphoblastoid cell lines and HIV-1 expression measured. First, trans-activation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by Tat was enhanced by EBNA-2 type 1 expression. trans-Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by Tat was also enhanced when CD4-positive cells were infected by EBV (strain B95.8) encoding an intact EBNA-2, but not by P3HR-1K with a deleted EBNA-2. In addition, CD4-positive cell clones stably expressing EBNA-2 supported enhanced HIV-1 replication as measured by accumulation of reverse transcriptase activity and syncytium induction. This provides direct evidence that EBV infection can enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells. Whether this in vitro phenomenon contributes to disease progression in vivo remains to be determined.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=9007201&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schrock, R D</author><author>Alberts, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Processivity of the gene 41 DNA helicase at the bacteriophage T4 DNA replication fork.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of biological chemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>16678-16682</pages><volume>271</volume><number>28</number><issue>28</issue><keywords><keyword>Bacteriophage T4/*genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Helicases/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Viral Proteins/*metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996-07-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9258</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.271.28.16678</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The gene 41 protein is the DNA helicase associated with the bacteriophage T4 DNA replication fork. This protein is a major component of the primosome, being essential for coordinated leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. Models suggest that such DNA helicases are loaded only onto DNA at origins of replication, and that they remain with the ensuing replication fork until replication is terminated. To test this idea, we have measured the extent of processivity of the 41 protein in the context of an in vitro DNA replication system composed of eight purified proteins (the gene 43, 44/62, 45, 32, 41, 59, and 61 proteins). After starting DNA replication in the presence of these proteins, we diluted the 41 helicase enough to prevent any association of new helicase molecules and analyzed the replication products. We measured an association half-life of 11 min, revealing that the 41 protein is processive enough to finish replicating the entire 169-kilobase T4 genome at the observed replication rate of approximately 400 nucleotides/s. This processivity of the 41 protein does not require the 59 protein, the protein that catalyzes 41 protein assembly onto 32 protein-covered single-stranded DNA. The stability we measure for the 41 protein as part of the replication fork is greater than estimated for it alone on single-stranded DNA. We suggest that the 41 protein interacts with the polymerase holoenzyme at the fork, both stabilizing the other protein components and being stabilized thereby.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=8663273&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tokunaga, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Function of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nef gene product in virus replication].</title><secondary-title>[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science</full-title><abbr-1>[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>345-357</pages><volume>71</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology</keyword><keyword>Gene Products, env/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gene Products, nef/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Genes, nef</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*physiology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/genetics</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus</keyword><keyword>Virion</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0367-6102</isbn><abstract>We comparatively analyzed the replication kinetics of wild-type (wt) and nef mutant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in several CD4-positive cell lines, in order to clarify the molecular function of Nef protein. The delayed growth of nef mutant virus was observed at the initial stage of replication in all cell lines examined. This phenomenon was greatly amplified in the absence of vpu gene. In order to determine the infection stage in viral replication cycle which is specifically affected on virus replication rate in the presence of the Nef protein, we first examined the difference between wt and nef mutant viruses in the virus production rate from transfected cells, and found that the both viruses were produced with equal efficiency. This result showed that Nef protein could be dispensable for virion production. Therefore, early infection stages were focused by single-round infection assay, and the nef mutant virus was found to be much less infectious than wt virus. This indicated that the effect of Nef protein was exhibited in the early phase of a virus replication cycle, during viral adsorption to integration. By entry assay using wt and nef mutant virions, it was revealed that the Nef protein was required for efficient viral entry. These data suggest that the Nef protein might play a role in efficient incorporation of the Env protein into the virions, leading to enhanced viral infectivity.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=8752529&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Demeret, C</author><author>Le Moal, M</author><author>Yaniv, M</author><author>Thierry, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Control of HPV 18 DNA replication by cellular and viral transcription factors.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic acids research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>4777-4784</pages><volume>23</volume><number>23</number><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenovirus E2 Proteins/physiology</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Binding Sites/genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Papillomaviridae/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Papillomaviridae/genetics</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology</keyword><keyword>Sp1 Transcription Factor/physiology</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995-12-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-1048</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/23.23.4777</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Papillomavirus replication in vivo requires the interaction of the virally encoded proteins E1 and E2 with the origin of replication which is localised in the regulatory region (long control region or LCR) of the viral genome. In genital human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the origin overlaps promoter elements of early transcription. In this study, we analysed the replication of HPV18 DNA using the complete LCR containing mutations in transcription regulatory elements. We found that each of the three E2 binding sites proximal to the AT-rich sequence of the origin contributes to the replication rate of DNA, although not identically. In addition, two sequences important for early transcription, an Sp1 binding site and the TATA box, were also found to play a role in replication. In contrast, two AP1 binding sites required for the enhancer-mediated activation of early transcription did not affect the replication, while other upstream sequences in the LCR did contribute to the replication efficiency. Our results indicate that besides a core origin of replication containing an AT-rich sequence and three E2 binding sites, auxiliary elements affect HPV18 DNA replication in the context of the full length LCR, some of which are important for transcription.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=8532518&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vande Berg, J S</author><author>Robson, M C</author><author>Mikhail, R J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extension of the life span of pressure ulcer fibroblasts with recombinant human interleukin-1 beta.</title><secondary-title>The American journal of pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of pathology</full-title><abbr-1>The American journal of pathology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1273-1282</pages><volume>146</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Survival/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-1/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Pressure Ulcer/*drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Pressure Ulcer/pathology</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0002-9440</isbn><abstract>Recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (rhuIL-1 beta) was investigated in a randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial to evaluate its effect on the healing of chronic pressure ulcers.

This follows from the finding that replication rates reported for 17 RNA species (genome length, 77-370 nucleotides) correlate with the self-interaction free energy of these self-annealed strands. Formation of double-stranded molecules during replication conversely decreased with self-interaction free energy. H-bond formation between self-complementary segments of folded RNA molecules plainly produces a potential energy barrier opposing the transition to a double-stranded, non-replicating form. Melting point temperature and resistance of RNA synthesis to elevated salt levels among three variants also increased with strand configuration free energy. Genome-based estimates of fitness in other self-replicating RNA species were therefore possible. Once a link between the kinetic parameters of replication and base sequence of these RNA species is adequately established, estimates of fitness can be dissociated from survival states following evolution, and Darwin's fundamental precept, 'survival of the fittest,' could be appraised as an experimentally testable hypothesis.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=7761483&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fox, C A</author><author>Loo, S</author><author>Dillin, A</author><author>Rine, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The origin recognition complex has essential functions in transcriptional silencing and chromosomal replication.</title><secondary-title>Genes &amp; development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes &amp; development</full-title><abbr-1>Genes &amp; development</abbr-1></periodical><pages>911-924</pages><volume>9</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Cycle/genetics</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes, Fungal/*genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA, Fungal/genetics</keyword><keyword>Eukaryotic Cells</keyword><keyword>Fungal Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Genes, Fungal/genetics</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Conformation</keyword><keyword>Origin Recognition Complex</keyword><keyword>Plasmids/genetics</keyword><keyword>Replication Origin*</keyword><keyword>Repressor Proteins/genetics</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins</keyword><keyword>Transcription, Genetic*</keyword><keyword>Yeasts/*genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995-04-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0890-9369</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gad.9.8.911</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The role of the origin recognition complex (ORC) was investigated in replication initiation and in silencing. Temperature-sensitive mutations in ORC genes caused defects in replication initiation at chromosomal origins of replication, as measured by two-dimensional (2-D) origin-mapping gels, fork migration analysis, and plasmid replication studies. These data were consistent with ORC functioning as a eukaryotic replication initiator. Some origins displayed greater replication initiation deficiencies in orc mutants than did others, revealing functional differences between origins. Alleles of ORC5 were isolated that were defective for silencing but not replication, indicating that ORC's role in silencing could be separated from its role in replication. In temperature-sensitive orc mutants arrested in mitosis, temperature-shift experiments caused a loss of silencing, indicating both that ORC had functions outside of the S phase of the cell cycle and that ORC was required for the maintenance of the silenced state.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=7774809&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chary, P</author><author>Latham, G J</author><author>Robberson, D L</author><author>Kim, S J</author><author>Han, S</author><author>Harris, C M</author><author>Harris, T M</author><author>Lloyd, R S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vivo and in vitro replication consequences of stereoisomeric benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxide adducts on adenine N6 at the second position of N-ras codon 61.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of biological chemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>4990-5000</pages><volume>270</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>7,8-Dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene 9,10-oxide*/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Adenine*</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Binding Sites</keyword><keyword>Blotting, Southern</keyword><keyword>Codon</keyword><keyword>DNA Adducts*</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>DNA Repair</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication</keyword><keyword>DNA/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA/biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>DNA/ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/genetics</keyword><keyword>Genes, ras*</keyword><keyword>Guanine</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis, Site-Directed</keyword><keyword>Plasmids</keyword><keyword>Point Mutation</keyword><keyword>Stereoisomerism</keyword><keyword>Templates, Genetic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995-03-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9258</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.270.10.4990</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxide (BPDE), a metabolite of the widespread environmental pollutant benzo[a]pyrene, is a mutagenic in both bacterial and mammalian systems. Toward understanding the mutagenic effects of different stereoisomers of BPDE at specific sites in DNA, six stereochemically defined BPDE adducts were constructed on adenine N6 at position 2 of the human N-ras 61 codon within an 11-base oligonucleotide fragment. Both the nonadducted and BPDE-adducted N-ras 61 11-mers were inserted into a unique EcoRI site in single-stranded M13mp7L2 DNA and utilized for in vivo studies. The ligation efficiencies of BPDE-adducted 11-mers into the single-stranded vector were determined by Southern hybridization and confirmed by electron microscopy. Repair-deficient AB2480 E. coli cells were transformed with adducted and non-adducted DNA samples. The resultant plaque-forming abilities were used to evaluate the replication competence of the various BPDE adducts with respect to the nonadducted 11-mer. Point mutations due to aberrant replication at the adducted site were identified by the technique of differential DNA hybridization. All of the six BPDE adducts examined were mutagenic in vivo, generating exclusively A--&gt;G mutations at frequencies ranging from 0.26 to 1.20%. In vitro replication studies using these BPDE-adducted 11-mers involved primer extension assays with Klenow fragment. All of the BPDE-modified templates demonstrated distinct blockage at the adducted site and/or 1 base 3' to the adducted site, allowing essentially no translesion synthesis to form fully extended polymerization products in vitro.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=7890605&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pato, M L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Central location of the Mu strong gyrase binding site is obligatory for optimal rates of replicative transposition.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</abbr-1></periodical><pages>7056-7060</pages><volume>91</volume><number>15</number><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>Bacteriophage mu/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Binding Sites</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis</keyword><keyword>Restriction Mapping</keyword><keyword>Sequence Deletion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994-07-19</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.91.15.7056</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The bacteriophage Mu genome contains a strong DNA gyrase binding site (SGS) near its center, and disruption of the SGS by deletion or by insertion results in long delays in replication following induction of the appropriate lysogen. To determine if the central location of the SGS is obligatory for its function in Mu replication, we pursued two lines of investigation. First, fragments of Mu DNA containing the SGS were inserted into various locations in a Mu prophage lacking the central SGS. Replication following induction was restored in all of the lysogens constructed, but the observed rate of replication for different prophages decreased with increasing distance between the new location of the SGS and the center of the genome. We also deleted different lengths of DNA from within the right half of a wild-type prophage, retaining the SGS and displacing it from a central location. Replication rates of the deleted prophages were reduced, with larger deletions resulting in larger reductions. Pairing deletions in the right half of the prophage with a deletion in the left half resulted in substantially higher rates of replication than observed with the right half deletions alone. We conclude that the SGS must be located centrally between the Mu termini for optimal rates of Mu replication. These results are discussed in terms of a model that proposes that the SGS is involved in organizing the topology of supercoiled prophage DNA to assist in synapsis of the Mu termini.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=8041745&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Franchi, D</author><author>Palagi, G</author><author>Bedini, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A PC-based generator of surface ECG potentials for computer electrocardiograph testing.</title><secondary-title>Computers and biomedical research, an international journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computers and biomedical research, an international journal</full-title><abbr-1>Computers and biomedical research, an international journal</abbr-1></periodical><pages>68-80</pages><volume>27</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Electrocardiography*</keyword><keyword>Microcomputers*</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted*</keyword><keyword>Software Design</keyword><keyword>User-Computer Interface</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0010-4809</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1006/cbmr.1994.1008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The system is composed of an electronic circuit, connected to a PC, whose outputs, starting from ECGs digitally collected by commercial interpretative electrocardiographs, simulate virtual patients' limb and chest electrode potentials.

When these adducted oligodeoxynucleotides were ligated into the single-stranded vector M13mp7L2 and the modified DNA used to transform repair-deficient Escherichia coli, the resultant plaque-forming abilities were found to vary as much as 300-fold, depending on the stereochemical configuration of the styrene oxide lesion and the sequence context in the vicinity of the damage. The frequency of mutations caused by the various styrene oxide adducts were similarly dependent on both their chirality and local sequence context. Oligodeoxynucleotide templates bearing these same four adducts were also constructed in order to evaluate their replication in vitro by the Klenow fragment. Three of the four styryl-modified templates yielded significant levels of fully extended primer upon polymerization. In contrast, the template containing R-styrene oxide at the second position of N-ras 61 was a very poor substrate for replication, a result which correlates well with the observed lethality of this lesion in vivo.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=8226868&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koup, R A</author><author>Brewster, F</author><author>Grob, P</author><author>Sullivan, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nevirapine synergistically inhibits HIV-1 replication in combination with zidovudine, interferon or CD4 immunoadhesin.</title><secondary-title>AIDS (London, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AIDS (London, England)</full-title><abbr-1>AIDS (London, England)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1181-1184</pages><volume>7</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Antiviral Agents/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>CD4 Immunoadhesins/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Drug Synergism</keyword><keyword>Feasibility Studies</keyword><keyword>HIV Reverse Transcriptase</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>In Vitro Techniques</keyword><keyword>Interferon Type I/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Nevirapine</keyword><keyword>Pyridines/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Zidovudine/*pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0269-9370</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/00002030-199309000-00005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: To determine whether synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 replication would result from the in vitro use of nevirapine in combination with zidovudine, interferon (IFN)-alpha 2C, and CD4 immunoadhesin.; Design and Methods: The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine (formerly BI-RG-587) was tested in combination with the other antiretrovial agents.

To approach this problem, we constructed a chimeric human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2)-gag-poliovirus minireplicon in which regions of the gag gene of HIV-2 were inserted in the poliovirus genome between nucleotides 1174 and 2470. Transfection of this chimeric RNA into HeLa cells results in the replication of the minireplicon and expression of an HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein which can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to HIV-2-gag. Expression of the HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein was dependent on replication of the chimeric RNA genome. Although the chimeric HIV-2-gag-poliovirus RNA genome replicated in poliovirus-infected cells, transfection of the chimeric HIV-2-gag-poliovirus genome into vaccinia virus-infected cells resulted in increased replication as measured by analysis of chimeric RNA. The increase in replication correlated with an increase in the expression of the HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein in vaccinia virus-infected cells. To characterize this system, we constructed a mutation in the 2A gene to change a cysteine at amino acid 109 to a serine. Expression of the HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein was not detected when the HIV-2-gag-poliovirus genome containing the 2A mutation was transfected into HeLa cells, demonstrating the mutation was lethal for replication. When the chimeric genome was transfected into poliovirus-infected cells, no RNA replication or expression of the HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein was observed. In contrast, transfection of this genome into vaccinia virus-infected cells resulted in replication of the chimeric RNA and expression of two proteins with larger molecular masses than the HIV-2-gag-P1 proteins, possibly representing HIV-2-gag-P1-2A and HIV-2-gag-P1-2ABC fusion proteins. The transfection of the chimeric HIV-2-gag-poliovirus genome containing the 2A mutation into poliovirus-vaccinia virus coinfected cells resulted in the expression and partial processing of the two larger HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion proteins to give the correct molecular mass for the HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein. The 2A mutation was reconstructed back into the full-length infectious cDNA of poliovirus. Transfection of this cDNA into vaccinia virus-infected cells followed by immunoprecipitation with anticapsid antibodies demonstrated the presence of two proteins with molecular masses larger than P1, possibly P1-2A and P1-2ABC fusion proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=8392603&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Windham, G L</author><author>Lawrence, G W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Host Status of Commercial Maize Hybrids to Rotylenchulus reniformis.</title><secondary-title>Journal of nematology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of nematology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of nematology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>745-748</pages><volume>24</volume><number>4S</number><issue>4S</issue><keywords><keyword>corn</keyword><keyword>host suitability</keyword><keyword>maize</keyword><keyword>nematode</keyword><keyword>reniform nematode</keyword><keyword>resistance</keyword><keyword>Rotylenchulus reniformis</keyword><keyword>Zea mays</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year><pub-dates><date>1992-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-300X</isbn><abstract>The host status of 50 commercial maize hybrids for a Mississippi population of Rotylenchulus reniformis was determined in greenhouse experiments.

Replicating DNA from T-lymphoma and myelomonocyte cell lines was density labeled with bromodeoxyuridine and extracted from cells which had been fractionated into different stages of S phase by centrifugal elutriation. The replicating DNA from each fraction of S phase was separated from nonreplicating DNA on density gradients, blotted, and hybridized with 34 specific MHC probes. The earliest replication occurred in the vicinity of transcribed genes K, HAM1 and HAM2, RD, B144, D, L, T18, and T3. The temporal order of replication of groups of DNA segments suggests the location of five or six replicons within the H-2 complex, some of which appear to be either unidirectional or markedly asymmetric. The rates of replication through each of these apparent replicons appear to be similar. The TL region of the S49.1 T-lymphoma cells, which contains at least three transcribed genes, replicates earlier than the inactive TL region of WEHI-3 myelomonocytic cells. These results provide further evidence of a relationship between transcription and the initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells. The mouse MHC examined in this study is the largest chromosomal region (&gt; 2,000 kb) measured for timing of replication to date.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=1406689&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walsh, J B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intracellular selection, conversion bias, and the expected substitution rate of organelle genes.</title><secondary-title>Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>939-946</pages><volume>130</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>DNA Replication/genetics</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Genes/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Models, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Models, Statistical</keyword><keyword>Mutation/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Organelles/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Probability</keyword><keyword>Selection, Genetic*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year><pub-dates><date>1992-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0016-6731</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/genetics/130.4.939</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A key step in the substitution of a new organelle mutant throughout a population is the generation of germ-line cells homoplasmic for that mutant. Given that each cell typically contains multiple copies of organelles, each of which in turn contains multiple copies of the organelle genome, processes akin to drift and selection in a population are responsible for producing homoplasmic cells. This paper examines the expected substitution rate of new mutants by obtaining the probability that a new mutant is fixed throughout a cell, allowing for arbitrary rates of genome turnover within an organelle and organelle turnover within the cell, as well as (possibly biased) gene conversion and genetic differences in genome and/or organelle replication rates. Analysis is based on a variation of Moran's model for drift in a haploid population. One interesting result is that if the rate of unbiased conversion is sufficiently strong, it creates enough intracellular drift to overcome even strong differences in the replication rates of wild-type and mutant genomes. Thus, organelles with very high conversion rates are more resistant to intracellular selection based on differences in genome replication and/or degradation rates. It is found that the amount of genetic exchange between organelles within the cell greatly influences the probability of fixation. In the absence of exchange, biased gene conversion and/or differences in genome replication rates do not influence the probability of fixation beyond the initial fixation within a single organelle. With exchange, both these processes influence the probability of fixation throughout the entire cell. Generally speaking, exchange between organelles accentuates the effects of directional intracellular forces.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=1582568&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fernandez-Larsson, R</author><author>Srivastava, K K</author><author>Lu, S</author><author>Robinson, H L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication of patient isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in T cells: a spectrum of rates and efficiencies of entry.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2223-2226</pages><volume>89</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*microbiology</keyword><keyword>CD4 Antigens/physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/*physiology</keyword><keyword>HIV-1/isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology</keyword><keyword>Viral Proteins/analysis</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year><pub-dates><date>1992-03-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.89.6.2223</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) undergo many different rates of replication, with the time course of replication being determined by the host cell and the virus. Recently, we demonstrated that the permissiveness of four CD4+ T-cell lines for the laboratory strain NL4-3 correlated with the rate and efficiency of virus entry. In this study, we have analyzed the replication of a "slow/low" isolate from the pre-AIDS period of infection and two "rapid/high" isolates from the AIDS period of infection to determine which steps in the virus life cycle determine differences in the growth characteristics of patient isolates. Differences in the growth of the patient isolates correlated with differences in entry but not postentry steps of the virus life cycle. The two rapid/high patient isolates (SF33 and SF216) underwent 50% entry in less than or equal to 0.5 hr in C8166 cells, in less than or equal to 1 hr in mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in greater than or equal to 2.5 hr in H9 cells. In contrast, a class 3 slow/low patient isolate required 1 hr for 50% entry into C8166 cells, 3 hr for 50% entry into peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and 5-6 hr for 50% entry into H9 cells. Entry efficiency correlated with entry rate, with the rapid/high viruses having a 2-fold higher titer and the slow/low virus having a 5-fold higher titer on C8166 than H9 cells. The laboratory strain NL4-3 displayed intermediate rates and efficiencies of entry. These data demonstrate that entry characteristics are major determinants of the pathogenic potential of patient isolates.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=1549586&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Simerl, N A</author><author>Wilcox, C J</author><author>Thatcher, W W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Postpartum performance of dairy heifers freshening at young ages.</title><secondary-title>Journal of dairy science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of dairy science</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of dairy science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>590-595</pages><volume>75</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cattle Diseases/physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Cattle/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Dystocia/physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Dystocia/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Endometritis/physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Endometritis/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fetal Death/physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Fetal Death/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Lactation*</keyword><keyword>Obstetric Labor Complications/*veterinary</keyword><keyword>Obstetric Labor Complications/physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Postpartum Period/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Puerperal Disorders/physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Puerperal Disorders/veterinary</keyword><keyword>Reproduction*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year><pub-dates><date>1992-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-0302</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(92)77796-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Records from Florida Agricultural Experiment Station dairy herd for 1144 heifers freshening from 1959 to 1979 were studied to evaluate effects of age and problems at parturition on subsequent yield and reproduction. Statistical analysis was by method of ordinary least squares analysis of variance; five measures of reproduction, survival to second lactation, and 15 measures of yield were studied. Mean first parturition age was 25.8 mo with 40% of individuals less than or equal to 23 mo; survival to second parturition was 67%. No effects of age at first parturition were detected on survival, postpartum reproductive performance, or milk composition other than lactose-mineral, chloride, and acidity percentages; effects on yield were similar to previous reports. Stillbirth did not affect subsequent reproductive performance but was associated with decreased milk yield: 181 kg or 5.2% of overall mean. Milk yield was depressed by 239 kg for retained fetal membrane, 173 kg for dystocia, and 98 kg for metritis; milk composition essentially was unaltered. Heritability of postpartum days to first estrus was .14; estimates were 0 for days to first service, days open, and calving interval. Additional research is needed on interrelationships of gestation length with subsequent yield and reproduction and in alleviating detrimental effects of problems at parturition.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=1560147&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burgers, P M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Saccharomyces cerevisiae replication factor C.

Lag time analysis showed that high affinity binding of RF-C to the primer terminus required PCNA and that this complex was recognized by the polymerase. The formation of stable complexes was investigated through their isolation by Bio-Gel A-5m filtration. A stable complex of RF-C and PCNA on primed single-stranded mp18 DNA was isolated when these factors were preincubated with the DNA and with ATP, or, less efficiently with ATP gamma S. These and additional experiments suggest that ATP binding promotes the formation of a labile complex of RF-C with PCNA at the primer terminus, whereas its hydrolysis is required to form a stable complex. Subsequently, DNA polymerase delta binds to either complex in a replication competent fashion without further energy requirement. DNA polymerase epsilon did not associate stably with RF-C and PCNA onto the DNA, but its transient participation with these cofactors into a holoenzyme-like initiation complex was inferred from its kinetic properties and replication product analysis. The kinetics of the elongation phase at 30 degrees, 110 nucleotides/s by DNA polymerase delta holoenzyme and 50 nucleotides/s by DNA polymerase epsilon holoenzyme, are in agreement with in vivo rates of replication fork movement in yeast. A model for the eukaryotic replication fork involving both DNA polymerase delta and epsilon is proposed.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=1682322&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Riley, A.L.</author><author>Kautz, M.A.</author><author>Geter, B.</author><author>Smurthwaite, S.T.</author><author>Pournaghash, S.</author><author>Melton, P.M.</author><author>Ferrari, C.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A demonstration of the graded nature of the generalization function of drug discrimination learning within the conditioned taste aversion procedure.</title><secondary-title>Behavioural pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Behavioural pharmacology</full-title><abbr-1>Behavioural pharmacology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>323-334</pages><volume>2</volume><number>4 And 5</number><issue>4 And 5</issue><dates><year>1991</year><pub-dates><date>1991-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1473-5849</isbn><abstract>Although control of discriminative performance will often generalize to different doses of the training drug or to drugs from the same class as the training drug, the nature of this generalization is unknown. Prior work has suggested that the generalization is primarily quantal in nature with animals displaying either vehicle-appropriate or drug-appropriate responding, depending upon their detection of the drug stimulus. It has been questioned whether this quantal nature of generalization reflects a characteristic response to drug stimuli or whether such responding is a function of the specific training and testing procedures used to establish and measure drug discrimination learning. The present paper evaluated this issue by analyzing the generalization functions of individual subjects trained and tested within one specific drug discrimination procedure, i.e. the conditioned taste aversion design. Responding within this design was generally graded. It is clear that quantal responding is not a necessary outcome of drug generalization assessments and that the nature of generalization in drug discrimination learning is a function of the specific procedure utilized in training and testing the discrimination. The results of the present analysis are discussed in terms of other recent work reporting graded functions.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=11224076&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnstone, B M</author><author>Leino, E V</author><author>Motoyoshi, M M</author><author>Temple, M T</author><author>Fillmore, K M</author><author>Hartka, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An integrated approach to meta-analysis in alcohol studies.</title><secondary-title>British journal of addiction</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>British journal of addiction</full-title><abbr-1>British journal of addiction</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1211-1220</pages><volume>86</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Alcoholism/*epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Cross-Cultural Comparison*</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Longitudinal Studies</keyword><keyword>Meta-Analysis as Topic*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year><pub-dates><date>1991-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0952-0481</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1360-0443.1991.tb01701.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The research design and methods utilized by the Collaborative Alcohol-Related Longitudinal Project are described.

We have found that 67 kb of telomere-adjacent DNA at the right end of chromosome V in S. cerevisiae is replicated late in S phase. An ARS element in this region, ARS501, was shown by two-dimensional gel analysis to be an active origin of replication. Kinetic analyses indicate that the rate of replication fork movement within this late region is similar to that in early replicating regions. Therefore, the delayed replication of the region is a consequence of late origin activation. The results also support the idea that the pattern of interspersed early and late replication along the chromosomes of higher eukaryotes is a consequence of the temporal regulation of origin activation.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=2018976&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, C S</author><author>Smith, K O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhanced replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 in human cells.</title><secondary-title>Journal of dental research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of dental research</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of dental research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>111-117</pages><volume>70</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>DNA Damage*</keyword><keyword>DNA Repair*/drug effects</keyword><keyword>DNA Repair*/radiation effects</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*/drug effects</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*/radiation effects</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/drug effects</keyword><keyword>DNA, Viral/radiation effects</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts/microbiology</keyword><keyword>Gamma Rays</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung/cytology</keyword><keyword>Methyl Methanesulfonate/analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Methyl Methanesulfonate/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Simplexvirus/*growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Simplexvirus/genetics</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Ultraviolet Rays</keyword><keyword>Viral Plaque Assay</keyword><keyword>Virus Activation*/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Virus Activation*/radiation effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year><pub-dates><date>1991-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-0345</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/00220345910700020301</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The effects of DNA-damaging agents on the replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) were assessed in vitro. Monolayers of human lung fibroblast cell lines were exposed to DNA-damaging agents (methyl methanesulfonate [MMS], methyl methanethiosulfonate [MMTS], ultraviolet light [UV], or gamma radiation [GR]) at specific intervals, before or after inoculation with low levels of HSV-1. The ability of cell monolayers to support HSV-1 replication was measured by direct plaque assay and was compared with that of untreated control samples. In this system, monolayers of different cell lines infected with identical HSV-1 strains demonstrated dissimilar levels of recovery of the infectious virus. Exposure of DNA-repair-competent cell cultures to DNA-damaging agents produced time-dependent enhanced virus replication. Treatment with agent before virus inoculation significantly (p less than 0.025) increased the number of plaques by 10 to 68%, compared with untreated control cultures, while treatment with agent after virus adsorption significantly increased (p less than 0.025) the number of plaques by 7 to 15%. In a parallel series of experiments, cells deficient in DNA repair (xeroderma pigmentosum) failed to support enhanced virus replication. These results suggest that after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, fibroblasts competent in DNA repair amplify the replication of HSV-1, and that DNA-repair mechanisms that act on a variety of chromosomal lesions may be involved in the repair and biological activation of HSV-1 genomes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=1846885&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schweighoffer, T</author><author>Schweighoffer, E</author><author>Apati, A</author><author>Antoni, F</author><author>Molnar, G</author><author>Lapis, K</author><author>Banfalvi, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytometric analysis of DNA replication inhibited by emetine and cyclosporin A.</title><secondary-title>Histochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Histochemistry</full-title><abbr-1>Histochemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>93-97</pages><volume>96</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biotin/analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Biotin/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cyclosporine/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Deoxyuracil Nucleotides/metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Emetine/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Flow Cytometry</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, Inbred Strains</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes/drug effects</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Thymus Gland/cytology</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells, Cultured</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year><pub-dates><date>1991</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0301-5564</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00266767</electronic-resource-num><abstract>DNA staining methods based on aspecific interactions with dye molecules have been replaced by an immunofluorescent approach to measure DNA replication.

The latter included the number of sperm (total and motile), volume and sperm concentrations of the sperm-rich fraction, and the percentage of progressively motile sperm in first and second ejaculates or per day. Replication requirements declined as the number of ejaculates per bull was increased to about 15 to 25 but declined minimally thereafter. The number of bulls needed per treatment varied in relation to the size of the treatment response to be detected but was much greater than the replication used in typical experiments.

Well-nourished rats were injected with tritiated thymidine at 15, 22, 28 or 84 d of age. At 1, 6, 11 and 16 d after injection animals from each group were killed, samples of adipose tissue were removed from two subcutaneous sites (abdominal and scapular) and separated, using collagenase (EC 3.4.24.3), into 'fat cell' and 'stromal cell' fractions. The specific (radio)activity of DNA isolated from each fraction was measured. The specific activity of DNA isolated from two 'deep body' sites (perirenal and epididymal) was measured only in the animals injected at 84 d of age. 2. Animals undernourished from birth up to 84 d of age were injected with tritiated thymidine at 22, 28 or 84 d of age. Animals were killed 1 and 11 d after injection, adipose tissue removed, and the specific activity of DNA measured. Other undernourished animals were rehabilitated from 84 to 107 d and injected at 91 d of age with tritiated thymidine. The animals were killed 1, 6, 11 and 16 d after injection, adipose tissue was removed from the subcutaneous and deep body sites and the specific activity of DNA determined as before. 3. In well-nourished animals fat cell replication had largely ceased by 12 weeks of age in the subcutaneous depots. There were differences between the various sites of adipose tissue regarding the period of hyperplastic growth, its timing or rate of replication or both. 4. In undernourished animals replication was slow in the subcutaneous depots compared with well-nourished animals of the same age. Rehabilitation from undernutrition stimulated replication which resulted in higher rates in all four depots examined compared with those in well-nourished animals. 5. The findings are discussed in relation to the concept of a finite period of hyperplasia for adipose tissue.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=7370216&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Whitman, T L</author><author>Spence, B H</author><author>Maxwell, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparison of external and self-instructional teaching formats with mentally retarded adults in a vocational training setting.</title><secondary-title>Research in developmental disabilities</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research in developmental disabilities</full-title><abbr-1>Research in developmental disabilities</abbr-1></periodical><pages>371-388</pages><volume>8</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Cognition</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Generalization, Psychological</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intellectual Disability/*rehabilitation</keyword><keyword>Intelligence</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Programmed Instructions as Topic*</keyword><keyword>Rehabilitation, Vocational</keyword><keyword>Teaching/methods</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year><pub-dates><date>1987</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0891-4222</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0891-4222(87)90020-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A theory recently proposed by Whitman postulates that self-instructional training procedures should have special utility for low ability individuals. Although past studies have shown that self-instructional training programs can be employed to improve the performance of mentally retarded individuals in work situations, research has not examined whether this training format is superior to external instruction. To test Whitman's theory, mentally retarded adults were taught to perform a complex sequencing task through one of two training formats: self-instruction or external instruction. Performance was evaluated through the examination of accuracy measures obtained during training, maintenance, and generalization assessments. Results indicated that participants receiving self-instructional training were able to achieve and sustain a higher level of performance than participants receiving external instruction. While self-instructionally trained subjects also showed superior performance on the generalization assessment, these results were not statistically significant. Secondary analyses revealed that higher ability participants, self-instructionally trained participants, and participants who reached criterion on the training and generalization tasks self-verbalized more frequently during the various assessments. In contrast to prediction, there was no significant difference in the length of time required to train individuals in the two instructional groups.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=3671816&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cress, D E</author><author>Jackson, P J</author><author>Kadouri, A</author><author>Chu, Y E</author><author>Lark, K G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DNA replication in soybean protoplasts and suspension-cultured cells: Comparison of exponential and fluorodeoxyuridine synchronized cultures.</title><secondary-title>Planta</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Planta</full-title><abbr-1>Planta</abbr-1></periodical><pages>241-253</pages><volume>143</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1978</year><pub-dates><date>1978-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0032-0935</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00391994</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cell-suspension cultures of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr., line SB-1) have been used to study DNA replication. Cells or protoplasts incorporate either radioactive thymidine or 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) into DNA. The DNA has been extracted as large molecules which can be visualized by autoradiography. Nuclei were isolated and lysed on slides thus avoiding degradation of DNA by a cytoplasmic endonuclease. The autoradiograms demonstrated that DNA synthesis occurs at several sites tandemly arranged on single DNA molecules separated by center to center distances ranging from 10 to 30 Î¼m. Velocity sedimentations through alkaline gradients confirm the lengths of the replicated regions seen in autoradiograms. By using velocity sedimentation it also has been possible to demonstrate that replication proceeds by the synthesis of very small (4-6S) DNA intermediates which join to form the larger, replicon-size pieces seen in autoradiograms. Both small (4-6S) and large (20-30S) intermediates are observed in synchronized and exponential cultures. However, after synchronization with fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) the rate of DNA synthesis is reduced. Since the size of intermediates is not reduced by FUdR treatment, it is concluded that the slower rate of replication results from a reduction in the number of tandem replication units but not in the rate at which they are elongated. After FUdR treatment, the density analogue of thymidine, BUdR, can be substituted for almost all of the thymidine residue in DNA, resulting in a buoyant density increase (in CsCl) from 1.694 to 1.747 g/cm(3). Using this density analogue it is possible to estimate the amount of template DNA attached to new replication sites. When this is done, it can be shown that synchronized cells initiate replication at about 5,000 different sites at the beginning of S. (Each such site will replicate to an average length of 20 Î¼m.) Use of BUdR also substantiates that at early stages of replication, very small replicated regions (&lt;8S) exist which are separated by unreplicated segments of DNA which replicate at a later time. Most of these conclusions agree with the pattern of DNA replication established for animal cells. However, a major difference appears to be that after prolonged inhibition of soybean cell replication with FUdR, very small, as well as replicon-size intermediates accumulate when replication is restored. This indicates that regulation of replication in these cells may be different from animal cells.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24408461&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Case-Smith, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An efficacy study of occupational therapy with high-risk neonates.</title><secondary-title>The American journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the American Occupational Therapy Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the American Occupational Therapy Association</full-title><abbr-1>The American journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the American Occupational Therapy Association</abbr-1></periodical><pages>499-506</pages><volume>42</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Feeding Behavior/physiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant Care</keyword><keyword>Infant, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Infant, Premature/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Motor Skills/physiology</keyword><keyword>Occupational Therapy*</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sucking Behavior/*physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1988</year><pub-dates><date>1988-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0272-9490</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5014/ajot.42.8.499</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This single-subject research study with replication evaluated the effect of daily occupational therapy on the nutritive and nonnutritive sucking behaviors of three high-risk, premature infants. At the time of entrance into the study, the infants were 34 to 35 weeks old and were documented poor feeders. Treatment consisted of individual, multimodal sensory stimulation, with emphasis on proprioceptive and vestibular input, graded to the sensory needs of the infants. Movement components of the jaw and tongue during nutritive and nonnutritive sucking were measured during baseline and intervention phases to assess the infants' sucking ability. A comparison of testing results revealed that during intervention the total sucking scores improved significantly for two of the three infants and that rapid changes occurred in the oral-motor function of all three infants. The results of the study suggest that occupational therapy can improve the rate of development of sucking in the premature neonate. However, future research needs to be done to isolate the specific techniques of treatment that produce positive changes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=3228153&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Andresdottir, V</author><author>Masters, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence that F' lac replicates asynchronously during the cell cycle of Escherichia coli B/r.</title><secondary-title>Molecular &amp; general genetics : MGG</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular &amp; general genetics : MGG</full-title><abbr-1>Molecular &amp; general genetics : MGG</abbr-1></periodical><pages>205-212</pages><volume>163</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>beta-Galactosidase/genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle*</keyword><keyword>Centrifugation, Density Gradient</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Induction</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/cytology</keyword><keyword>F Factor*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1978</year><pub-dates><date>1978-07-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0026-8925</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00267411</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The replication of F' lac was studied in exponentially growing cultures of E. coli B/r.

Plasmide replication was measured in each age fraction by three methods: the rate at which beta-galactosidase could be induced, the amount of label incorporated into CCC plasmid DNA which had been separated from chromosomal DNA on agarose gels, and the amount of label incorporated into plasmid DNA which had been separated from chromosomal DNA by ultracentrifugation through CsCl-EtBr gradients.

The kinetics of copy number correction from low to steady-state levels (termed repopulation) were determined using two different methods of copy number reduction. Thermosensitive replication (Tsr) mutants of pT181 were grown at nonpermissive temperatures to lower copy number and then shifted to a permissive temperature to allow repopulation. After the downshift, both wild-type and copy mutant plasmids, with active inhibitors, exhibited a burst of exponential replication that resulted in a two- to threefold overshoot of normal steady-state copy numbers. This was followed by inhibition of replication and eventual reestablishment of the steady-state replication rate. Similar replication kinetics were observed when these plasmids were introduced into naive cells by high-frequency transduction. By contrast, a pT181 copy mutant with a nonfunctional inhibitor-target regulation did not overshoot its steady-state copy number, but instead repopulated asymptotically. These results suggest that at low copy numbers, pT181 and its derivatives replicate at near-maximal rates and overshoot prior to the establishment of an inhibitory concentration of repressor. The maximal replication rate is independent of the plasmid's cop genotype. As the copy number increases, inhibitor accumulates and eventually reduces the replication rate. In the absence of an active inhibitor, the steady-state copy number is established at a level that must be limited by some other invariant factor.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=2442785&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Green, L W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation and measurement: some dilemmas for health education.</title><secondary-title>American journal of public health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of public health</full-title><abbr-1>American journal of public health</abbr-1></periodical><pages>155-161</pages><volume>67</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cost-Benefit Analysis</keyword><keyword>Costs and Cost Analysis</keyword><keyword>Documentation</keyword><keyword>Evaluation Studies as Topic</keyword><keyword>Health Education*</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Patient Education as Topic</keyword><keyword>Research Design</keyword><keyword>Risk</keyword><keyword>Statistics as Topic</keyword><keyword>Teaching</keyword><keyword>Teaching Materials</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1977</year><pub-dates><date>1977-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0090-0036</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2105/ajph.67.2.155</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Seven dilemmas of evaluation and measurement posed by the nature of health education are presented, together with suggestions for their resolution.

As a secondary problem, the two identified measures of kinesthetic sensitivity were also studied in relation to the independent variables of extent of forearm angular movement, direction of movement (supination or pronation), and order that the discrimination and reproduction tests were administered (transfer effect of first test on the second). There was little statistical relationship between kinesthetic discrimination and reproduction sensitivity measures. Both measures of kinesthetic sensitivity were similar in their relationship to the independent variables of extent, direction, and transfer. In both cases, the only significant main effect was that of extent (short movements more accurate than long). Kinesthetic discrimination was observed to be a much more stable measurement of kinesthetic sensitivity than movement reproduction.

In one type of experiment, plasmid replication was found to stop immediately after the addition of an inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol (Cm) to growing cultures. Chromosomal replication showed the slow turnoff that is usual for Cm inhibition. Because plasmid replication rate is determined autogenously, no host factor can be rate limiting, suggesting that the specific factor affected is Rep C. In another type of experiment, we constructed a translational fusion between the repC coding sequence and a translationally inducible Cm-acetylase gene, cat-86, using pUB110 as the carrier replicon. The fusion plasmid showed an eightfold amplification of its own copy number and a similar amplification of a co-resident pT181 plasmid upon Cm induction. The amplified plasmids did not show autocatalytic runaway replication but rather established stable elevated copy numbers, indicating the existence of a secondary level of regulation. These results suggest that RepC is rate limiting for pT181 replication and support the hypothesis that pT181 replication is regulated at the level of RepC synthesis. The nature of the secondary regulation is unknown.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=3462754&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tack, L C</author><author>DePamphilis, M L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of simian virus 40 chromosome-T-antigen complexes: T-antigen is preferentially associated with early replicating DNA intermediates.</title><secondary-title>Journal of virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of virology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of virology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>281-295</pages><volume>48</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Antibodies, Monoclonal</keyword><keyword>Antigens, Viral, Tumor</keyword><keyword>Antigens, Viral/*analysis</keyword><keyword>Antigens, Viral/immunology</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>Genes, Viral*</keyword><keyword>Immune Sera</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Precipitin Tests</keyword><keyword>Simian virus 40/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Simian virus 40/immunology</keyword><keyword>Simian virus 40/physiology</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication*</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1983</year><pub-dates><date>1983-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-538X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JVI.48.1.281-295.1983</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The fraction and DNA composition of simian virus 40 chromosomes that were complexed with large T-antigens (T-Ag) were determined at the peak of viral DNA replication. Simian virus 40 chromatin containing radiolabeled DNA was extracted by the hypotonic method of Su and DePamphilis (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 73:3466-3470, 1976) and then fractionated by sucrose gradient sedimentation into replicating (90S) and mature (70S) chromosomes. Viral chromosomes containing T-Ag were isolated by immunoprecipitation with saturating amounts of either an anti-T-Ag monoclonal antibody or an anti-T-Ag hamster serum under conditions that specifically precipitated T-Ag protein from cytosol extracts. An average of 10% of the uniformly labeled DNA in the 90S pool and 7.5% in the 70S pool was specifically precipitated, demonstrating that under these conditions immunologically reactive T-Ag was tightly bound to only 8% of the total viral chromosomes. In contrast, simian virus 40 replicating intermediates (RI) represented only 1.2% of the viral DNA, but most of these molecules were associated with T-Ag. At the shortest pulse-labeling periods, an average of 72 +/- 18% of the radiolabeled DNA in 90S chromosomes could be immunoprecipitated, and this value rapidly decreased as the labeling period was increased. Electron microscopic analysis of the DNA before and after precipitation revealed that about 55% of the 90S chromosomal RI and 72% of the total RI from both pools were specifically bound to T-Ag. Comparison of the extent of replication with the fraction of RI precipitated revealed a strong selection for early replicating DNA intermediates. Essentially all of the RI in the 70S chromosomes were less than 30% replicated and were precipitated with anti-T-Ag monoclonal antibody or hamster antiserum. An average of 88% of the 90S chromosomal RI which were from 5 to 75% replicated were immunoprecipitated, but the proportion of RI associated with T-Ag rapidly decreased as replication proceeded beyond 70% completion. By the time sibling chromosomes had separated, only 3% of the newly replicated catenated dimers in the 90S pool (&lt;1% of the dimers in both pools) were associated with T-Ag. Measurements of the fraction of radiolabeled DNA in each quarter of the genome confirmed that T-Ag was preferentially associated with newly initiated molecules in which the nascent DNA was nearest the origin of replication. These results are consistent with a specific requirement for the binding of T-Ag to viral chromosomes to initiate DNA replication, and they also demonstrate that T-Ag does not immediately dissociate from chromosomes once replication begins. The biphasic relationship between the fraction of T-Ag-containing RI and the extent of DNA replication suggests either that 1 or 2 molecules of T-Ag remain stably bound until replication is about 70% completed or that 4 to 6 molecules of T-Ag are randomly released from each RI at a uniform rate throughout replication.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=6310148&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giles, D E</author><author>Schlesser, M A</author><author>Rush, A J</author><author>Orsulak, P J</author><author>Fulton, C L</author><author>Roffwarg, H P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polysomnographic findings and dexamethasone nonsuppression in unipolar depression: a replication and extension.</title><secondary-title>Biological psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biological psychiatry</full-title><abbr-1>Biological psychiatry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>872-882</pages><volume>22</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Depressive Disorder/genetics</keyword><keyword>Dexamethasone*</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hydrocortisone/*blood</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Psychological Tests</keyword><keyword>Reaction Time/physiology</keyword><keyword>Sleep Stages/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Sleep, REM/physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year><pub-dates><date>1987-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-3223</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0006-3223(87)90085-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To evaluate the replicability of our previous findings of increased incidence of biological dysregulation in endogenous depression, we have studied a new series of patients with major depressive disorder, unipolar type (n = 103).

The autoradiographic experiments were designed to show whether the larger amounts of nuclear DNA are correlated with more rapid rates of synthesis and/or with longer replication units. -- The DNA replication rate was 2.5 mu/minute (corrected for two growing points) with 10 minutes 3H-thymidine label at 22 degrees C, but decreased with longer labelling durations. The length of the replication unit (estimated by the distance from the center of one autoradiograph to the center of the next in sequence) was most commonly in the 10-25 mu range with a 30 minute label, in all four species. The average center-to-center distance was 8 mu at 10 minutes and increased with label duration, to over 45 mu with 24 hours label. Replication was predominantly but not exclusively bidirectional. Neither rate of replication nor length of the replication unit was proportional to the amount of DNA in these species.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=125187&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walker, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Complex-irreversibility and evolution.</title><secondary-title>Experientia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experientia</full-title><abbr-1>Experientia</abbr-1></periodical><pages>806-813</pages><volume>39</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Biological Evolution*</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication</keyword><keyword>DNA, Single-Stranded/genetics</keyword><keyword>Genetic Code</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation*</keyword><keyword>Models, Genetic*</keyword><keyword>Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1983</year><pub-dates><date>1983-08-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0014-4754</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF01990396</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Both, irreversibility and evolution, imply order in time. It is argued that the only possible concept of time is a 'system-specific time', and that order in time is convertible into order in space and vice-versa. While life-less, complex systems are irreversible because of their complexity and, hence, not repeatable, living systems are reproduced by irreversible copy-reproduction and by coding. This mode of reproduction results of necessity in an arrow of time of growth and increasing complexity with death as its antagonist, and in obligatory spatial asymmetry. This arrow of increasing organic complexity is simultaneous with, and independent of, the arrow of increasing entropy. - A generalized, organic hierarchy is proposed as the model to study higher evolution. This hierarchy reproduces itself by differential rates of reproduction of its subunits within and between the various hierarchical levels of organization. Phylogenetic change is brought about by a change in this hierarchy's specific phase pattern of growth. Continuous and discrete organization is defined, and it is shown that specific relations between continuous and discrete levels within the hierarchy result in accumulation of neutral alleles. This accumulation is due to complex-irreversibility and causes genetic stabilisation, i.e. heritability, of the species-specific morphology of organisms.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=6873230&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, C W</author><author>Priest, J H</author><author>Byrd, J R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DNA replication sequence in a dicentric (functionally monocentric) X chromosome formed by the joining of two X chromosomes at region p22.</title><secondary-title>American journal of medical genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of medical genetics</full-title><abbr-1>American journal of medical genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>305-317</pages><volume>11</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Banding</keyword><keyword>Densitometry</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication*</keyword><keyword>Dosage Compensation, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gonadal Dysgenesis/genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Karyotyping</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Mosaicism</keyword><keyword>Sex Chromatin/analysis</keyword><keyword>Sex Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Sex Chromosomes/*ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome/*ultrastructure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1982</year><pub-dates><date>1982-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0148-7299</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ajmg.1320110307</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this study we used densitometry to evaluate DNA replication kinetics in a rearranged chromosome formed by the joining of two X chromosomes at region p22. No 45X mosaicism is present in peripheral blood or fibroblast cultures. The patient has primary amenorrhea, short stature, and gonadal dysgenesis. The sequence of replication in the majority of cells is p11, q11, q13, q22-24, q12, p22, q26, q28, q27, q25, and p21, q21. Thus p11 is the earliest region to replicate, and q21 is the last. In 66% of 127 cells analyzed, the replication pattern is asymmetric, and bands q12, q26, and q28 are most likely to be out of phase on the two sides of the breakpoint. We find that band p22 has a delay of replication compared to an abnormal X derived from two X chromosomes joined at the q23 region previously reported by us. Structural rearrangement may therefore delay replication in the region of the break.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=7081296&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Windham, G L</author><author>Williams, W P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproduction of Meloidogyne javanica on Corn Hybrids and Inbreds.</title><secondary-title>Journal of nematology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of nematology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of nematology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>25-28</pages><volume>20</volume><number>Annals 2</number><issue>Annals 2</issue><keywords><keyword>corn</keyword><keyword>host suitability</keyword><keyword>javanese root-knot nematode</keyword><keyword>maize</keyword><keyword>Meloidogyne javanica</keyword><keyword>resistance</keyword><keyword>Zea mays</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1988</year><pub-dates><date>1988-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-300X</isbn><abstract>The reproductive potential of a Meloidogyne javanica population on 64 commercial corn hybrids and 33 corn inbred lines was determined in greenhouse experiments. Reproduction was measured by determining RF values (final egg number per initial egg number) and number of eggs per gram of fresh root. All corn hybrids supported reproduction greater than RF = 1.0. RF values for the hybrids ranged from 1.1 for 'Pioneer 3147' to 15.5 for 'Coker 8575'. Three inbreds -- MpT03, NC246, and Mp307 -- maintained M. javanica below the initial population level, with RF values of 0.7, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively. Three other inbreds -- F6, Mp704, and T220 -- maintained M. javanica at RF = 1.0.

This plasmid designated pJCC31 and five other clones, which were made by cleaving the 503-bp segment in relation to a dispersed repeated sequence and subcloning, were compared with pBR322 for replication by microinjection into Xenopus eggs. The replication measured by incorporation of a 32P-labeled nucleotide as well as semiconservative segregation and dilution of N6-methyladenine at the EcoRI sites showed pJCC31 to be about 15 times as efficient as pBR322. The next most efficient subclone, pJCC31-2, contains an insert with a complete 320-bp dispersed repeated sequence bracketed by an 8-bp direct repeat. This observation, along with our previous report that repeated sequences of the Alu family in the human genome enhanced replication of the vector plasmid nearly as much as that of the presumptive Xenopus origin, leads to the hypothesis that members of a subset of the short dispersed repeated sequences in vertebrates function as origins for chromosomal replication. Preliminary studies also show that the presumptive Xenopus origin contains a RNA polymerase promoter that increases the transcription of the plasmid when it is microinjected into Xenopus oocytes.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=6752953&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Woodman, D R</author><author>Schultz, W W</author><author>Woodman, K L</author><author>Weiss, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Growth of Rickettsia typhi in irradiated L cells enhanced by lysosomal stabilization.</title><secondary-title>Infection and immunity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection and immunity</full-title><abbr-1>Infection and immunity</abbr-1></periodical><pages>61-67</pages><volume>23</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cortisone/*pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Glucuronidase/metabolism</keyword><keyword>L Cells/*microbiology</keyword><keyword>L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lysosomes/*physiology</keyword><keyword>Lysosomes/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Rickettsia typhi/*growth &amp; development</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1979</year><pub-dates><date>1979-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0019-9567</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/iai.23.1.61-67.1979</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The growth of some obligate intracellular parasites is contingent upon avoidance of lysosomal activation during growth in their host cells. This is accomplished by the various parasites by different mechanisms and with different degrees of efficiency. The possibility was tested that the lysosomal stabilizer cortisone acetate might protect and thus enhance the growth of Rickettsia typhi in mouse L cells irradiated 6 days earlier. Beginning 2 days before infection of the L cells with a multiplicity of 10 rickettsiae, 20 microgram of cortisone per ml was added in medium 199 containing 5% fetal calf serum. This concentration of cortisone was below the cytotoxic level, as determined by viability staining, but was sufficient to significantly alter the ratios of cellular and released acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase in uninfected and infected cells, as shown by spectrophotometric analysis. Rickettsial replication, measured by hemolytic activity at 96 h and confirmed by microscopic observations at earlier stages of infection, was increased by the cortisone. Cortisone concentrations of 10 or 40 microgram/ml were less effective, and cortisone was ineffective when the rickettsial multiplicity per L cell was 2 or lower. These results indicate that amounts of cortisone that increase lysosomal stabilization in L cells favor rickettsial multiplication when the multiplicity of infection is relatively high.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=106007&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morris Hooke, A</author><author>Sordelli, D O</author><author>Cerquetti, M C</author><author>Vogt, A J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitative determination of bacterial replication in vivo.</title><secondary-title>Infection and immunity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection and immunity</full-title><abbr-1>Infection and immunity</abbr-1></periodical><pages>424-427</pages><volume>49</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections/*microbiology</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli/*growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Mathematics</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, Inbred ICR</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Pseudomonas Infections/*microbiology</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Temperature</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1985</year><pub-dates><date>1985-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0019-9567</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/iai.49.2.424-427.1985</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A new methodology which permits the quantitative measurement of absolute bacterial replication in vivo is proposed. Mice were inoculated with mixtures of temperature-sensitive mutants and parental wild types, and the changes in the ratios of the two strains were measured. The number of wild-type generations was calculated from the declining ratios over time with the formula n = log (r0/rt)/log 2; n is the number of generations, and r0 and rt are the ratio of temperature-sensitive mutants to the parental wild type at time zero and at the times sampled throughout the experiment. The replication rate was determined by regression analysis. A mathematical argument for the formula is presented. Using this technique, we determined the mean generation times of Escherichia coli (33 min) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20 min) in the peritoneal cavities of mice, in the face of host clearance mechanisms during the first stages of infection.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=3926651&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls></record></records></xml>
