In this paper, we have two aims: to examine how and when the results of replications are used in management and organization research and to use the results of this examination to offer guidelines for improving the self-correction process. Design/methodology/approach: Study 1 analyzes co-citation patterns for 135 original-replication pairs to assess the direct impact of replications, specifically examining how often and when a replication study is co-cited with its original. In Study 2, a similar design is employed to measure the indirect impact of replications by assessing how often and when a meta-analysis that includes a replication of the original study is co-cited with the original study. Findings: Study 1 reveals, among other things, that a huge majority (92%) of sources that cite the original study fail to co-cite a replication study, thus calling into question the impact of replications in our field. Study 2 shows that the indirect impact of replications through meta-analyses is likewise minimal. However, our analyses also show that replications published in the same journal that carried the original study and authored by teams including the authors of the original study are more likely to be co-cited, and that articles in higher-ranking journals are more likely to co-cite replications. Originality/value: We use our results to formulate recommendations that would streamline the self-correction process in management research at the author-, reviewer- and journal-level. Our recommendations would create incentives to make replication attempts more common, while also increasing the likelihood that these attempts are targeted at the most relevant original studies. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190363991&amp;doi=10.1108%2fJOCM-10-2023-0436&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=397fcb423d200cca8ac5157dbc132aad</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tadesse, B.</author><author>Aregahagn, S.</author><author>Muluneh, B.T.</author><author>Worku, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatio-temporal ditribution and transmission dynamics of sheep pox and goat pox diseases in South Wollo zone north East Ethiopia</title><secondary-title>Heliyon</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Heliyon</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e27470</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sheep pox (SP) and goat pox diseases (GP) are highly transmittable, malignant systemic and economically significant caused by the genus Capripoxvirus. using The spatio-temporal distribution of SP and GP outbreaks in South Wollo zone from September 2013 to December 2019 was determined retrospectively using SP and GP outbreaks report Kombolcha regional laboratory. A follow up study was also conducted from December 2019 to March 2021 to estimate the transmission parameter of SP and GP outbreaks in South Wollo zone of Kutaber district, Amhara region. Tissue samples from outbreaks in Kundi and Haroye kebele of Kutaber district were taken to confirm the outbreak by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The transmission parameters were estimated using Generalized linear model (GLM) based on stochastic Susceptible Infected and Recovered (SIR) model. In South Wollo zone, 249 SGP outbreaks were reported from 2013 to 2019. The incidence differed between months, with a highest peak in October and November and a lowest peak in February. The basic reproduction ratios (R0) of the SGP disease outbreaks were 1.84 and 3 for Haroye and Kundi kebele outbreaks, respectively. The disease is distributed throughout the zone and the investigated active outbreaks had moderate transmission between animals. Hence, it needs a great effort which focuses on the application of control measures that reduce the transmission of the disease. © 2024 The Author(s)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187005252&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.heliyon.2024.e27470&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b3925c67cf83c819d059585eee3811ff</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Costigan, S.</author><author>Ruscio, J.</author><author>Crawford, J.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Performing Small-Telescopes Analysis by Resampling: Empirically Constructing Confidence Intervals and Estimating Statistical Power for Measures of Effect Size</title><secondary-title>Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/25152459241227865</electronic-resource-num><abstract>When new data are collected to check the findings of an original study, it can be challenging to evaluate replication results. The small-telescopes method is designed to assess not only whether the effect observed in the replication study is statistically significant but also whether this effect is large enough to have been detected in the original study. Unless both criteria are met, the replication either fails to support the original findings or the results are mixed. When implemented in the conventional manner, this small-telescopes method can be impractical or impossible to conduct, and doing so often requires parametric assumptions that may not be satisfied. We present an empirical approach that can be used for a variety of study designs and data-analytic techniques. The empirical approach to the small-telescopes method is intended to extend its reach as a tool for addressing the replication crisis by evaluating findings in psychological science and beyond. In the present tutorial, we demonstrate this approach using a Shiny app and R code and included an analysis of most studies (95%) replicated as part of the Open Science Collaboration’s Reproducibility Project in Psychology. In addition to its versatility, simulations demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the empirical approach to implementing small-telescopes analysis. © The Author(s) 2024.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188065881&amp;doi=10.1177%2f25152459241227865&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bcc8796173eaaa8b71828b311e7a1264</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imholze, C.</author><author>Hutterer, K.</author><author>Gall, D.</author><author>Dannlowski, U.</author><author>Domschke, K.</author><author>Leehr, E.J.</author><author>Lonsdorf, T.B.</author><author>Lueken, U.</author><author>Reif, A.</author><author>Rosenkranz, K.</author><author>Schiele, M.A.</author><author>Zwanzger, P.</author><author>Pauli, P.</author><author>Gamer, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of Changes in Negative Affect during the COVID-19 Pandemic by Experimental Fear Conditioning and Generalization Measures: A Longitudinal Study</title><secondary-title>Zeitschrift fur Psychologie / Journal of Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zeitschrift fur Psychologie / Journal of Psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>137-148</pages><volume>231</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1027/2151-2604/a000523</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Adverse experiences interact with individual vulnerability in the etiology of mental disorders, but due to the paucity of longitudinal studies, their precise interplay remains unclear. Here, we investigated how individual differences in threat responsiveness modulated adjustments in negative affect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 441) underwent a fear conditioning and generalization experiment between 2013 and 2020 and were reassessed regarding anxiety and depression symptoms after the pandemic outbreak. Participants showed increased levels of negative affect following pandemic onset, which were partly modulated by laboratory measures of threat responsiveness. Decreased differentiation of threat and safety signals in participants with higher prepandemic depression and anxiety scores in the laboratory assessment were most predictive of increased symptom levels after the onset of the pandemic. However, effects were small and should be replicated in independent samples to further characterize how individual differences in threat processing interact with adverse experiences in the development of psychopathology. © 2023 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161356623&amp;doi=10.1027%2f2151-2604%2fa000523&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e3280d02b4a85f96422f0680b89651e4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, M.</author><author>Ruan, J.</author><author>Wan, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Reproduction Study of the Human Evaluation of Role-Oriented Dialogue Summarization Models</title><secondary-title>HumEval 2023 - Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems, associated with the 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing 2023, RANLP 2023</secondary-title></titles><pages>124-129</pages><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.26615/978-954-452-088-5_010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper reports a reproduction study of the human evaluation of role-oriented dialogue summarization models, as part of the ReproNLP Shared Task 2023 on Reproducibility of Evaluations in NLP.

However, the conventional hot embossing process poses two challenges: First, the plates that are used do not provide uniform pressure, and the size of the chamber limits the imprinting area. Second, heating with thick metal plates significantly lengthens cycle time. Finally, the uniformity of temperature also affects the embossing results. To achieve a high heating rate and uniform pressure over a large area, this study combined an induction heating system and roll-to-plate hot embossing. A movable plate was used to move the mold through the induction coil, increasing the heating area and overcoming limitations related to the embossing area posed by the coil length. The imprinting area reached 100 × 100 mm2. In addition, the temperature difference was less than 20°C at each molding temperature range from 150°C to 190°C. The mold and the substrate were placed on a vacuum absorber to prevent deformation and slippage of the mold and provide preloading and packing pressure. Cooling fans were employed to improve cooling efficiency. Experimental replication yielded replication rates higher than 97% at 190°C and 5 kgf/cm2 with a cycle time of approximately 2 minutes. To verify the feasibility of the process, V-groove microstructures were successfully fabricated using a movable induction heating roller embossing facility. Highlights: The feasibility of the moving induction heating roller embossing process. A vacuum movable platform prevents deformation and slippage of the substrate.

This study aims to determine the impact of these chemicals on rotifers. As sexual reproduction is often more sensitive to toxicants than amictic reproduction, this study focuses on endpoints describing sexual reproduction and on the impact on the gene expression of three receptors associated with reproduction: retinoid-x-receptor (rxr), retinoid activated receptor (rar) and membrane-associated progesterone receptor (mapr). Brachionus calyciflorus was exposed to environmental concentrations of SCCPs (10,100 and 1000 ng/L) and the impact on sexual reproduction (mixis rate, fertilization rate, resting egg production and viability, inter-generational effects) was assessed. Variations in the gene expressions of rxr, rar and mapr were also studied through RT-qPCR analysis. Our results show that SCCPs increase the mixis rate but decrease the fertilization rate, leading to unaltered resting egg production. Exposure to SCCPs also affected the mRNA levels of the studied receptors in ways which could be linked to observed changes in mixis and fertilization rates. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169159057&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10750-023-05348-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=253aedc3f7b08cf5dd2cde30580dfab3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wagner, B.</author><author>Pellerin, D.</author><author>Huet, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative Study of Natural Replay and Experience Replay in Online Object Detection</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - 2023 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, ICCVW 2023</secondary-title></titles><pages>3587-3595</pages><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICCVW60793.2023.00386</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Online Object Detection (OOD) algorithms play a crucial role in dynamic and real-world computer vision applications. In these scenarios, models are trained on a data stream where old class samples are revisited, a phenomenon known as Natural Replay (NR). During training, NR occurs unevenly across object categories, leading to evaluation metrics biased towards the most frequently revisited classes. Existing benchmarks lack proper quantification of NR and depict short-term training scenarios on a single domain. As a result, evaluating generalization capabilities and forgetting rates of models become challenging in OOD. In this paper, we address the challenges surrounding the evaluation of OOD models by proposing two key contributions. Firstly, we define a metric to quantify NR in an OOD scenario and show how NR is related to class specific forgetting. Secondly, we introduce a novel benchmark, EgOAK, which introduces a long-term training scenario that involves frequent domain shifts. It allows the evaluation of models' generalization capabilities and forgetting of knowledge on past domains. Our results in this OOD setting reveal that Experience Replay, a memory-based method, is particularly effective for better generalization to new domains and for preserving past knowledge. Leveraging replay from memory helps to address the low natural replay rate for rarely revisited classes, resulting in improved adaptability and reliability of models in dynamic environments. © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182944022&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICCVW60793.2023.00386&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8ea1f362c081ba3c19577d0594c85f11</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, G.</author><author>Ke, L.</author><author>Srinivasa, S.</author><author>Gupta, A.</author><author>Rajeswaran, A.</author><author>Kumar, V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real World Offline Reinforcement Learning with Realistic Data Source</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation</secondary-title></titles><pages>7176-7183</pages><volume>2023-May</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10161474</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) holds great promise for robot learning due to its ability to learn from arbitrary pre-generated experience. However, current ORL benchmarks are almost entirely in simulation and utilize contrived datasets like replay buffers of online RL agents or sub-optimal trajectories, and thus hold limited relevance for real-world robotics. In this work (Real-ORL), we posit that data collected from safe operations of closely related tasks are more practical data sources for real-world robot learning. Under these settings, we perform an extensive (6500+ trajectories collected over 800+ robot hours and 270+ human labor hour) empirical study evaluating generalization and transfer capabilities of representative ORL methods on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks. Our study finds that ORL and imitation learning prefer different action spaces, and that ORL algorithms can generalize from leveraging offline heterogeneous data sources and outperform imitation learning.

Despite multiple efforts, the area remains a focus of research interest. Indeed, while promising results have reported in past literature, uptake of automatic sleep scoring in the clinical setting remains low. One of the current issues regards the difficulty to generalization performance results beyond the local testing scenario, i.e. across data from different clinics. Issues derived from data-privacy restrictions, that generally apply in the medical domain, pose additional difficulties in the successful development of these methods. We propose the use of several decentralized deep-learning approaches, namely ensemble models and federated learning, for robust inter-database performance generalization and data-privacy preservation in automatic sleep staging scenario. Specifically, we explore four ensemble combination strategies (max-voting, output averaging, size-proportional weighting, and Nelder-Mead) and present a new federated learning algorithm, so-called sub-sampled federated stochastic gradient descent (ssFedSGD). To evaluate generalization capabilities of such approaches, experimental procedures are carried out using a leaving-one-database-out direct-transfer scenario on six independent and heterogeneous public sleep staging databases. The resulting performance is compared with respect to two baseline approaches involving single-database and centralized multiple-database derived models. Our results show that proposed decentralized learning methods outperform baseline local approaches, and provide similar generalization results to centralized database-combined approaches. We conclude that these methods are more preferable choices, as they come with additional advantages concerning improved scalability, flexible design, and data-privacy preservation.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169695069&amp;doi=10.1109%2fJBHI.2023.3310869&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a65e7e210ffe07fbc067bada9ca4a1a5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zou, X.</author><author>Perlaza, S.M.</author><author>Esnaola, I.</author><author>Altman, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms via the Worst-Case Data-Generating Probability Measure</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</secondary-title></titles><pages>17271-17279</pages><volume>38</volume><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1609/aaai.v38i15.29674</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper, the worst-case probability measure over the data is introduced as a tool for characterizing the generalization capabilities of machine learning algorithms. More specifically, the worst-case probability measure is a Gibbs probability measure and the unique solution to the maximization of the expected loss under a relative entropy constraint with respect to a reference probability measure. Fundamental generalization metrics, such as the sensitivity of the expected loss, the sensitivity of the empirical risk, and the generalization gap are shown to have closed-form expressions involving the worst-case data-generating probability measure. Existing results for the Gibbs algorithm, such as characterizing the generalization gap as a sum of mutual information and lautum information, up to a constant factor, are recovered. A novel parallel is established between the worst-case data-generating probability measure and the Gibbs algorithm. Specifically, the Gibbs probability measure is identified as a fundamental commonality of the model space and the data space for machine learning algorithms.

Specifically, ReproHum focuses on the reproducibility of human evaluation studies, where participants indicate the quality of different outputs of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. This is necessary because without reproduction studies, we do not know how reliable earlier results are. This paper aims to reproduce the second human evaluation study of Puduppully and Lapata (2021), while another lab is attempting to do the same. This experiment uses best-worst scaling to determine the relative performance of different NLG systems. We found that the worst performing system in the original study is now in fact the best performing system across the board. This means that we cannot fully reproduce the original results. We also carry out alternative analyses of the data, and discuss how our results may be combined with the other reproduction study that is carried out in parallel with this paper. © HumEval 2023 - Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems, associated with the 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing 2023, RANLP 2023.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184805236&amp;doi=10.26615%2f978-954-452-088-5_007&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=729fb40ba0d3ee90b49c79fa68708cd8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allen, S.G.</author><author>Zhang, C.</author><author>Malone, S.</author><author>Roy, S.</author><author>Dess, R.T.</author><author>Jackson, W.C.</author><author>Mehra, R.</author><author>Speers, C.</author><author>Chinnaiyan, A.M.</author><author>Sun, Y.</author><author>Spratt, D.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of sequencing of androgen receptor-signaling inhibition and radiotherapy in prostate cancer: importance of homologous recombination disruption</title><secondary-title>World Journal of Urology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>World Journal of Urology</full-title></periodical><pages>3877-3887</pages><volume>41</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00345-023-04649-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: The synergy of combining androgen receptor-signaling inhibition (ARSI) to radiotherapy (RT) in prostate cancer has been largely attributed to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) inhibition. However, this mechanism is unlikely to explain recently observed trial results that demonstrated the sequencing of ARSI and RT significantly impacts clinical outcomes, with adjuvant ARSI following RT yielding superior outcomes to neoadjuvant/concurrent therapy. We hypothesized this is driven by differential effects on AR-signaling and alternative DNA repair pathway engagement based on ARSI/RT sequencing. Methods: We explored the effects of ARSI sequencing with RT (neoadjuvant vs concurrent vs adjuvant) in multiple prostate cancer cell lines using androgen-deprived media and validation with the anti-androgen enzalutamide. The effects of ARSI sequencing were measured with clonogenic assays, AR-target gene transcription and translation quantification, cell cycle analysis, DNA damage and repair assays, and xenograft animal validation studies. Results: Adjuvant ARSI after RT was significantly more effective at killing colony forming cells and decreasing the transcription and translation of downstream AR-target genes across all prostate cancer models evaluated. These results were reproduced in xenograft studies. The differential effects of ARSI sequencing were not fully explained by NHEJ inhibition alone, but by the additional disruption of homologous recombination specifically with adjuvant sequencing of ARSI. Conclusion: We demonstrate that altered sequencing of ARSI and RT mediates differential anti-AR-signaling and anti-cancer effects, with the greatest benefit from adjuvant ARSI following RT. These results, combined with our prior clinical findings, support the superiority of an adjuvant-based sequencing approach when using ARSI with RT. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174301365&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00345-023-04649-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=25c6850803d60f7a2880f5e7b23da8fe</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhen, J.</author><author>Gu, Y.</author><author>Wang, P.</author><author>Wang, W.</author><author>Bian, S.</author><author>Huang, S.</author><author>Liang, H.</author><author>Huang, M.</author><author>Yu, Y.</author><author>Chen, Q.</author><author>Jiang, G.</author><author>Qiu, X.</author><author>Xiong, L.</author><author>Liu, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide association and Mendelian randomisation analysis among 30,699 Chinese pregnant women identifies novel genetic and molecular risk factors for gestational diabetes and glycaemic traits</title><secondary-title>Diabetologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Diabetologia</full-title></periodical><pages>703-713</pages><volume>67</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00125-023-06065-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aims/hypothesis: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common disorder in pregnancy; however, its underlying causes remain obscure. This study aimed to investigate the genetic and molecular risk factors contributing to GDM and glycaemic traits. Methods: We collected non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) sequencing data along with four glycaemic and 55 biochemical measurements from 30,699 pregnant women during a 2 year period at Shenzhen Baoan Women’s and Children’s Hospital in China. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted between genotypes derived from NIPTs and GDM diagnosis, baseline glycaemic levels and glycaemic levels after glucose challenges. In total, 3317 women were diagnosed with GDM, while 19,565 served as control participants. The results were replicated using two independent cohorts. Additionally, we performed one-sample Mendelian randomisation to explore potential causal associations between the 55 biochemical measurements and risk of GDM and glycaemic levels. Results: We identified four genetic loci significantly associated with GDM susceptibility. Among these, MTNR1B exhibited the highest significance (rs10830963-G, OR [95% CI] 1.57 [1.45, 1.70], p=4.42×10–29), although its effect on type 2 diabetes was modest. Furthermore, we found 31 genetic loci, including 14 novel loci, that were significantly associated with the four glycaemic traits. The replication rates of these associations with GDM, fasting plasma glucose levels and 0 h, 1 h and 2 h OGTT glucose levels were 4 out of 4, 6 out of 9, 10 out of 11, 5 out of 7 and 4 out of 4, respectively. Mendelian randomisation analysis suggested that a genetically regulated higher lymphocytes percentage and lower white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage and absolute neutrophil count were associated with elevated glucose levels and an increased risk of GDM. Conclusions/interpretation: Our findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of GDM and glycaemic traits during pregnancy in an East Asian population and highlight the potential role of inflammatory pathways in the aetiology of GDM and variations in glycaemic levels. Data availability: Summary statistics for GDM; fasting plasma glucose; 0 h, 1 h and 2h OGTT; and the 55 biomarkers are available in the GWAS Atlas (study accession no.: GVP000001, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gwas/browse/GVP000001).

Recent computing technologies, such as virtualization, have made it possible to reproduce workflow execution with ease. However, the reproducibility of results is not well discussed; that is, there is no standard way to verify whether the biological interpretation of reproduced results is the same. Therefore, it still remains a challenge to automatically evaluate the reproducibility of results. Results: We propose a new metric, a reproducibility scale of workflow execution results, to evaluate the reproducibility of results. This metric is based on the idea of evaluating the reproducibility of results using biological feature values (e.g., number of reads, mapping rate, and variant frequency) representing their biological interpretation. We also implemented a prototype system that automatically evaluates the reproducibility of results using the proposed metric. To demonstrate our approach, we conducted an experiment using workflows used by researchers in real research projects and the use cases that are frequently encountered in the field of bioinformatics. Conclusions: Our approach enables automatic evaluation of the reproducibility of results using a fine-grained scale. By introducing our approach, it is possible to evolve from a binary view of whether the results are superficially identical or not to a more graduated view. We believe that our approach will contribute to more informed discussion on reproducibility in bioinformatics. © The Author(s) 2023.

There is an urgent desire for highly accurate and efficient dose calculation methods. This study aims to develop a dose super resolution-based deep learning model for fast and accurate dose prediction in clinical practice. Method: A Multi-stage Dose Super-Resolution Network (MDSR Net) architecture with sparse masks module and multi-stage progressive dose distribution restoration method were developed to predict high-resolution dose distribution using low-resolution data. A total of 340 VMAT plans from different disease sites were used, among which 240 randomly selected nasopharyngeal, lung, and cervix cases were used for model training, and the remaining 60 cases from the same sites for model benchmark testing, and additional 40 cases from the unseen site (breast and rectum) was used for model generalizability evaluation. The clinical calculated dose with a grid size of 2 mm was used as baseline dose distribution. The input included the dose distribution with 4 mm grid size and CT images. The model performance was compared with HD U-Net and cubic interpolation methods using Dose-volume histograms (DVH) metrics and global gamma analysis with 1%/1 mm and 10% low dose threshold. The correlation between the prediction error and the dose, dose gradient, and CT values was also evaluated. Results: The prediction errors of MDSR were 0.06–0.84% of Dmean indices, and the gamma passing rate was 83.1–91.0% on the benchmark testing dataset, and 0.02–1.03% and 71.3–90.3% for the generalization dataset respectively. The model performance was significantly higher than the HD U-Net and interpolation methods (p &lt; 0.05). The mean errors of the MDSR model decreased (monotonously by 0.03–0.004%) with dose and increased (by 0.01–0.73%) with the dose gradient. There was no correlation between prediction errors and the CT values. Conclusion: The proposed MDSR model achieved good agreement with the baseline high-resolution dose distribution, with small prediction errors for DVH indices and high gamma passing rate for both seen and unseen sites, indicating a robust and generalizable dose prediction model. The model can provide fast and accurate high-resolution dose distribution for clinical dose calculation, particularly for the routine practice of OLART. © 2022</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146998377&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.zemedi.2022.10.006&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4129d03edcbfe06f0859188ced67c8bc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Y.</author><author>Pat, N.</author><author>Neale, M.C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Associations between resting state functional brain connectivity and childhood anhedonia: A reproduction and replication study</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>18</volume><number>5 MAY</number><issue>5 MAY</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0277158</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background Previously, a study using a sample of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) ® study from the earlier 1.0 release found differences in several resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) brain connectivity measures associated with children reporting anhedonia. Here, we aim to reproduce, replicate, and extend the previous findings using data from the later ABCD study 4.0 release, which includes a significantly larger sample. Methods To reproduce and replicate the previous authors' findings, we analyzed data from the ABCD 1.0 release (n = 2437), from an independent subsample from the newer ABCD 4.0 release (excluding individuals from the 1.0 release) (n = 6456), and from the full ABCD 4.0 release sample (n = 8866). Additionally, we assessed whether using a multiple linear regression approach could improve replicability by controlling for the effects of comorbid psychiatric conditions and sociodemographic covariates. Results While the previously reported associations were reproducible, effect sizes for most rsfMRI measures were drastically reduced in replication analyses (including for both t-tests and multiple linear regressions) using the ABCD 4.0 (excluding 1.0) sample. However, 2 new rsfMRI measures (the Auditory vs. Right Putamen and the Retrosplenial-Temporal vs. Right-Thalamus-Proper measures) exhibited replicable associations with anhedonia and stable, albeit small, effect sizes across the ABCD samples, even after accounting for sociodemographic covariates and comorbid psychiatric conditions using a multiple linear regression approach. Conclusion The most statistically significant associations between anhedonia and rsfMRI connectivity measures found in the ABCD 1.0 sample tended to be non-replicable and inflated. Contrastingly, replicable associations exhibited smaller effects with less statistical significance in the ABCD 1.0 sample. Multiple linear regressions helped assess the specificity of these findings and control the effects of confounding covariates.  © 2023 Zhou et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158850496&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0277158&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b764e4ea20317c5b0bf6546d15a73612</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, F.</author><author>Moon, W.</author><author>Letsou, W.</author><author>Sapkota, Y.</author><author>Wang, Z.</author><author>Im, C.</author><author>Baedke, J.L.</author><author>Robison, L.</author><author>Yasui, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-Wide Analysis of Rare Haplotypes Associated with Breast Cancer Risk</title><secondary-title>Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>332-345</pages><volume>83</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-1888</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Numerous common genetic variants have been linked to breast cancer risk, but they only partially explain the total breast cancer heritability. Inference from Nordic population-based twin data indicates rare high-risk loci as the chief determinant of breast cancer risk. Here, we use haplotypes, rather than single variants, to identify rare high-risk loci for breast cancer. With computationally phased genotypes from 181,034 white British women in the UK Biobank, a genome-wide haplotype–breast cancer association analysis was conducted using sliding windows of 5 to 500 consecutive array-genotyped variants. In the discovery stage, haplotype–breast cancer associations were evaluated retrospectively in the prestudyenrollment data including 5,487 breast cancer cases. Breast cancer hazard ratios (HR) for additive haplotypic effects were estimated using Cox regression. The replication analysis included a prospective cohort of women free of breast cancer at enrollment, of whom 3,524 later developed breast cancer. This two-stage analysis detected 13 rare loci (frequency &lt;1%), each associated with an appreciable breast cancer-risk increase (discovery: HRs ¼ 2.84–6.10, P &lt; 5 × 10–8; replication: HRs ¼ 2.08–5.61, P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, the variants that formed these rare haplotypes individually exhibited much smaller effects. Functional annotation revealed extensive cisregulatory DNA elements in breast cancer–related cells underlying the replicated rare haplotypes. Using phased, imputed genotypes from 30,064 cases and 25,282 controls in the DRIVE OncoArray case–control study, 6 of the 13 rare–loci associations were found generalizable (odds ratio estimates: 1.48–7.67, P &lt; 0.05). This study demonstrates the complementary advantage of utilizing rare haplotypes to capture novel risk loci and suggests the potential for the discovery of more genetic elements contributing to cancer heritability as large data sets of germline whole-genome sequencing become available. ©2022 American Association for Cancer Research.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146484797&amp;doi=10.1158%2f0008-5472.CAN-22-1888&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=23805d9f094fae2ad2c45ba5cbbd3bf8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arantes, A.C.S.</author><author>Ribeiro, J.C.S.</author><author>Soares, D.S.</author><author>Reis, A.C.</author><author>Cardoso, M.D.G.</author><author>Remedio, R.N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Alpha- and beta-pinene isomers act differently to control Rhipicephalus microplus (Acari: Ixodidae)</title><secondary-title>Parasitology Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Parasitology Research</full-title></periodical><volume>123</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00436-024-08187-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus is an ectoparasite of high importance in veterinary medicine and public health. Since synthetic chemicals used to control these ticks can select resistant strains and cause toxic effects in their hosts, there is a need to identify effective substances with fewer adverse effects. For this reason, we investigated the effects of alpha- and beta-pinene, known for their various biological effects, on the mortality and reproductive performance of R. microplus engorged female ticks. The products were diluted in a 2% Tween 80 aqueous solution. The ticks were first weighed and then immersed in the test solutions for five minutes. Then, they were dried with paper towels and fixed dorsoventrally in Petri dishes, totalling five treatment groups for each pinene and a control group treated with the solvent alone. The ticks were monitored daily for mortality, and their eggs were collected and weighed. The larval hatching rate was estimated, and the pre-oviposition and incubation periods were determined. From these data, the following parameters were calculated: egg production index, fertility rate, estimated reproduction rate, percentages of reduction in oviposition and hatching, and product efficacy. Alpha-pinene showed better results at higher concentrations, unlike beta-pinene, which was more effective at lower concentrations. The effectiveness of alpha-pinene was 74% at a concentration of 14.0 μL/mL, while beta-pinene showed 78% efficacy at 2.0 μL/mL. The results indicated for the first time different effects of two isomers in ticks, suggesting that these compounds act on R. microplus females in different ways. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188073551&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00436-024-08187-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f2a9d99a4e2a6e876768c19dcd5b07a9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pak, N.S.</author><author>Peredo, T.N.</author><author>Madero Ucero, A.P.</author><author>Kaiser, A.P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EMT en Español Para Autismo: A Collaborative Communication Intervention Approach and Single Case Design Pilot Study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10803-024-06322-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The primary purpose of the current pilot study was to test the effects of an adapted and collaborative intervention model with a systematic teaching approach on Latina Spanish-speaking caregivers’ use of EMT en Español Para Autismo strategies with their young children on the autism spectrum. A multiple baseline across behaviors single case design was replicated across two dyads. A series of family interviews and a direct therapist-child intervention phase supported individualization of the intervention. Families were provided speech generating devices as part of their children’s intervention protocol. Caregivers were taught to use EMT en Español Para Autismo strategies with aided language input. Strategies included contingent target-level and proximal target-level language modeling, linguistic expansions, and communication elicitations. Secondary variables measured included generalization of strategy use to unsupported interactions and at a 2-month follow-up, child communication outcomes, and social validity. There was a strong functional relation for one dyad between the adapted and collaborative intervention and caregiver use of EMT strategies. The functional relation was weakened by behavioral covariation for the other dyad. Children increased the quantity and diversity of their communication during the study. Caregivers generalized their use of most EMT strategies and reported most aspects of the approach to be socially valid. The current study provides an initial demonstration of an effective model for adaptation and individualization of naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions for Latino Spanish-speaking families with children on the autism spectrum. © The Author(s) 2024.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190379652&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10803-024-06322-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=50485c5546634d9cb555ce75307b362c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Micheloud, C.</author><author>Balabdaoui, F.</author><author>Held, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing replicability with the sceptical -value: Type-I error control and sample size planning</title><secondary-title>Statistica Neerlandica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Statistica Neerlandica</full-title></periodical><pages>573-591</pages><volume>77</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/stan.12312</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We study a statistical framework for replicability based on a recently proposed quantitative measure of replication success, the sceptical (Figure presented.) -value. A recalibration is proposed to obtain exact overall Type-I error control if the effect is null in both studies and additional bounds on the partial and conditional Type-I error rate, which represent the case where only one study has a null effect. The approach avoids the double dichotomization for significance of the two-trials rule and has larger project power to detect existing effects over both studies in combination. It can also be used for power calculations and requires a smaller replication sample size than the two-trials rule for already convincing original studies.

Here, we report seven preregistered online experiments conducted with volunteer U.S. participants (N = 6,953) that sought to replicate and probe the boundary conditions of this finding. Contrary to expectations, we found no shift in implicit racial evaluations in two close replication attempts (Experiments 1–2). Experiments 3–4 ruled out the possibility of insufficiently strong exemplar valence and subtyping as explanations for the failures to replicate. In Experiment 5, implicit racial evaluations did exhibit malleability in response to two different procedures relying on repeated evaluative pairings and evaluative statements, suggesting that they are capable of change. With insight from these studies, Experiments 6–7 were mounted with modifications to the Dasgupta and Greenwald (2001) procedure. Significant reductions in implicit pro-White/anti-Black evaluations were now observed when race, valence, and the contingency between the two were highlighted. In addition, across all experiments, the magnitude of shift in implicit racial evaluations was significantly predicted by participants’ ability to recall the Black–positive and White–negative contingencies experienced during the exemplar exposure task. Together, these data suggest that exposure to counterattitudinal exemplars can shift implicit racial evaluations toward neutrality, but such malleability strongly depends on contingency awareness. We discuss implications for social cognitive theory, theoretically informed debiasing interventions, and different paths toward resolving initial replication failures. © 2023 American Psychological Association</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183343508&amp;doi=10.1037%2fpspa0000370&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6aae288c1c474500f92ab878cddeeea7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>González-Corbelle, J.</author><author>Alonso-Moral, J.M.</author><author>Bugarín-Diz, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Some lessons learned reproducing human evaluation of a data-to-text system</title><secondary-title>HumEval 2023 - Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems, associated with the 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing 2023, RANLP 2023</secondary-title></titles><pages>49-68</pages><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.26615/978-954-452-088-5_005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper presents a human evaluation reproduction study regarding the data-to-text generation task.

However, reference angles are often not available. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine joint position sense at three different targeted joint angles, which were estimated from the maximum range of motion (maxROM) without a reference angle at each targeted joint angle. METHODS: The maxROM was measured in straight leg raise (SLR) and active knee extension (AKE) positions. In both positions, a targeted joint angle at 75% of the maxROM was assessed first, followed by that at 50% and 25% of the maxROM. A one-sample t-test was used to analyze differences between the targeted and reproduced angles in both positions. RESULTS: All reproduced angles significantly differed from the targeted angle in both SLR and AKE positions except for the reproduced angle measured at 75% maxROM. Overall, position errors in the AKE position were higher than those in the SLR position. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating the angle based on the maxROM without a matched reference angle may lead to significant discrepancies in comparison with the targeted joint angle. In clinical settings, if accurate reproduction of motions is required to improve proprioception, providing a reference angle might be helpful. © 2024 - IOS Press.

Aims: The aim of this paper is to investigate the reproducibility of previous empirical studies that used Simulink model corpora and to evaluate the generalizability of their results to a newer and larger corpus, including a comparison with proprietary models. Method: The study reviews methodologies and data sources employed in prior Simulink model studies and replicates the previous analysis using SLNET. In addition, we propose a heuristic for determining code-generating Simulink models and assess the open-source models' similarity to proprietary models. Results: Our analysis of SLNET confirms and contradicts earlier findings and highlights its potential as a valuable resource for model-based development research. We found that open-source Simulink models follow good modeling practices and contain models comparable in size and properties to proprietary models. We also collected and distribute 208 git repositories with over 9k commits, facilitating studies on model evolution. Conclusions: The replication study offers actionable insights and lessons learned from the reproduction process, including valuable information on the generalizability of research findings based on earlier open-source corpora to the newer and larger SLNET corpus. The study sheds light on noteworthy attributes of SLNET, which is self-contained and redistributable.  © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178657287&amp;doi=10.1109%2fESEM56168.2023.10304867&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c45f387cf33279b11fd8e7362edf961f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oldt, R.F.</author><author>Beisner, B.</author><author>Cameron, A.</author><author>Pomerantz, O.</author><author>Kanthaswamy, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pedigree Data from Six Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta) Matrilines at the California National Primate Research Center Indicate Inbreeding and Loss of Genetic Variation</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science</full-title></periodical><pages>502-511</pages><volume>62</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.30802/AALAS-JAALAS-23-000038</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Relatedness and kinship structure in matrilines are a potential source of social stability. The current study aimed to analyze the extant pedigrees of 6 living matrilines in different field cages to assess rates of cross-generational inbreeding and loss of genetic variation over time. All 6 matrilines showed increasing levels of inbreeding over generation time, although the rates of increase were different. The female-to-male-adult sex ratio was correlated with average matriline inbreeding levels, while the number of adult males was positively correlated with average matriline genetic diversity. Over five times more paternal half-sibs than maternal half-sibs were present because paternity had been restricted to a few males yearly. Therefore, the relatedness through the paternal lines was over five times greater than that of the maternal lines. Overall, each matriline lost low to moderate levels of genetic variation with time. The current rates of gene flow between field cages by cross-fostered infants have not stopped inbreeding within these matrilines or loss of diversity due to genetic drift. This situation probably developed because translocated animals, especially males, may not breed successfully. Only 4 of the 22 translocated individuals, all females, eventually reproduced, resulting in 13 offspring and generating an overall breeding success of 0.59 across all 6 study matrilines. However, even this low rate of reproduction by the translocated animals reduced inbreeding and kinship among matrilines and increased genetic heterogeneity in the matrilines. Based on this study, we propose several colony management strategies, including equalizing adult sex ratios to increase the effective population size in the field cages, increasing the number of cross-fostered infants, and relying more on multigenerational pedigree data to aid the alignment of genetic and behavioral management techniques.

An effective EMS is crucial for coordinating power flow while ensuring safety, such as maintaining the battery state of charge within safe limits, which presents a challenging task. Traditional reinforcement learning struggles with safety constraints, and the penalty method often leads to suboptimal performance. This study introduces Lagrangian-based parameterized soft actor–critic (PASACLag), a novel safe hybrid-action reinforcement learning algorithm for HEV energy management. PASACLag utilizes a unique composite action representation to handle continuous actions (e.g., engine torque) and discrete actions (e.g., gear shift and clutch engagement) concurrently. It integrates a Lagrangian method to separately address control objectives and constraints, simplifying the reward function and enhancing safety. We evaluate PASACLag’s performance using the World Harmonized Vehicle Cycle (901 s), with a generalization analysis of four different cycles. The results indicate that PASACLag achieves a less than 10% increase in fuel consumption compared to dynamic programming. Moreover, PASACLag surpasses PASAC, an unsafe counterpart using penalty methods, in fuel economy and constraint satisfaction metrics during generalization. These findings highlight PASACLag’s effectiveness in acquiring complex EMS for control within a hybrid action space while prioritizing safety. © 2024 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187442360&amp;doi=10.3390%2fmath12050663&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=777de13d5a7a7859229488c6bf0063b9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aiello, T.-F.</author><author>Puerta-Alcalde, P.</author><author>Chumbita, M.</author><author>Lopera, C.</author><author>Monzó, P.</author><author>Cortes, A.</author><author>Fernández-Avilés, F.</author><author>Suárez-Lledó, M.</author><author>Correa, J.</author><author>Ortiz-Maldonado, V.</author><author>Cuesta, G.</author><author>Martinez-Cibrian, N.</author><author>Esteve, J.</author><author>Marcos, M.Á.</author><author>Mensa, J.</author><author>Soriano, A.</author><author>Garcia-Vidal, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Current outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection in high-risk haematological patients treated early with antivirals</title><secondary-title>Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy</full-title></periodical><pages>1454-1459</pages><volume>78</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jac/dkad105</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objectives: We aimed to describe the clinical outcomes and duration of viral shedding in high-risk patients with haematological malignancies hospitalized with COVID-19 during Omicron variant predominance who received early treatment with antivirals. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study on high-risk haematological patients admitted in our hospital between December 2021 and March 2022. We performed detection techniques on viral subgenomic mRNAs until negative results were obtained to document active, prolonged viral replication. Results: This analysis included 60 consecutive adults with high-risk haematological malignancies and COVID-19. All of these patients underwent early treatment with remdesivir. Thirty-two (53%) patients received combined antiviral strategies, with sotrovimab or hyperimmune plasma being added to remdesivir. The median length of viral replication—as measured by real-time RT-PCR and/or subgenomic RNA detection—was 20 (IQR 14–28) days. Prolonged viral replication (6 weeks after diagnosis) was documented in six (10%) patients. Only two patients had prolonged infection for more than 2 months. Overall mortality was 5%, whereas COVID-19-related mortality was 0%. Conclusions: Current outcomes of high-risk patients with haematological malignancies hospitalized with COVID-19 during Omicron variant predminance are good with the use of early antiviral strategies. Persistent viral shedding is uncommon. © The Author(s) 2023.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162084036&amp;doi=10.1093%2fjac%2fdkad105&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=70e7d75381a3c9bf85b4963ec8efbe79</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Y.</author><author>Sánchez-Tójar, A.</author><author>O’Dea, R.E.</author><author>Noble, D.W.A.</author><author>Koricheva, J.</author><author>Jennions, M.D.</author><author>Parker, T.H.</author><author>Lagisz, M.</author><author>Nakagawa, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Publication bias impacts on effect size, statistical power, and magnitude (Type M) and sign (Type S) errors in ecology and evolutionary biology</title><secondary-title>BMC Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Biology</full-title></periodical><volume>21</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12915-022-01485-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Collaborative efforts to directly replicate empirical studies in the medical and social sciences have revealed alarmingly low rates of replicability, a phenomenon dubbed the ‘replication crisis’. Poor replicability has spurred cultural changes targeted at improving reliability in these disciplines. Given the absence of equivalent replication projects in ecology and evolutionary biology, two inter-related indicators offer the opportunity to retrospectively assess replicability: publication bias and statistical power. This registered report assesses the prevalence and severity of small-study (i.e., smaller studies reporting larger effect sizes) and decline effects (i.e., effect sizes decreasing over time) across ecology and evolutionary biology using 87 meta-analyses comprising 4,250 primary studies and 17,638 effect sizes. Further, we estimate how publication bias might distort the estimation of effect sizes, statistical power, and errors in magnitude (Type M or exaggeration ratio) and sign (Type S). We show strong evidence for the pervasiveness of both small-study and decline effects in ecology and evolution. There was widespread prevalence of publication bias that resulted in meta-analytic means being over-estimated by (at least) 0.12 standard deviations. The prevalence of publication bias distorted confidence in meta-analytic results, with 66% of initially statistically significant meta-analytic means becoming non-significant after correcting for publication bias. Ecological and evolutionary studies consistently had low statistical power (15%) with a 4-fold exaggeration of effects on average (Type M error rates = 4.4). Notably, publication bias reduced power from 23% to 15% and increased type M error rates from 2.7 to 4.4 because it creates a non-random sample of effect size evidence. The sign errors of effect sizes (Type S error) increased from 5% to 8% because of publication bias. Our research provides clear evidence that many published ecological and evolutionary findings are inflated. Our results highlight the importance of designing high-power empirical studies (e.g., via collaborative team science), promoting and encouraging replication studies, testing and correcting for publication bias in meta-analyses, and adopting open and transparent research practices, such as (pre)registration, data- and code-sharing, and transparent reporting. © 2023, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151710679&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12915-022-01485-y&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bdb5452716430c2bbe40eeda4ba8a26e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tufanaru, C.</author><author>Surian, D.</author><author>Scott, A.M.</author><author>Glasziou, P.</author><author>Coiera, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 2-week systematic review (2weekSR) method was successfully blind-replicated by another team: a case study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</full-title></periodical><volume>165</volume><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jclinepi.2023.10.013</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: To assess the replicability of a 2-week systematic review (index 2weekSR) created with the assistance of automation tools using the fidelity method. Methods: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses compliant SR protocol was developed based on the published information of the index 2weekSR study. The replication team consisted of three reviewers. Two reviewers blocked off time during the replication. The total time to complete tasks and the meta-analysis results were compared with the index 2weekSR study. Review process fidelity scores (FSs) were calculated for review methods and outcomes. Barriers to completing the replication were identified. Results: The review was completed over 63 person-hours (11 workdays/15 calendar days). A FS of 0.95 was achieved for the methods, with 3 (of 8) tasks only partially replicated, and an FS of 0.63 for the outcomes, with 6 (of 7) only partially replicated and one task was not replicated. Nonreplication was mainly caused by missing information in the index 2weekSR study that was not required in standard reporting guidelines. The replication arrived at the same conclusions as the original study. Conclusion: A 2weekSR study was replicated by a small team of three reviewers supported by automation tools. Including additional information when reporting SRs should improve their replicability. © 2023 The Author(s)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178106016&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jclinepi.2023.10.013&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bcfb68fbabaeaf43634e77f725d2328e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fort, G.</author><author>Pascal, B.</author><author>Abry, P.</author><author>Pustelnik, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Covid19 Reproduction Number: Credibility Intervals by Blockwise Proximal Monte Carlo Samplers</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</full-title></periodical><pages>888-900</pages><volume>71</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TSP.2023.3247142</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Monitoring the COVID19 pandemic constitutes a critical societal stake that received considerable research efforts. The intensity of the pandemic on a given territory is efficiently measured by the reproduction number, quantifying the rate of growth of daily new infections. Recently, estimates for the time evolution of the reproduction number were produced using an inverse problem formulation with a nonsmooth functional minimization. While it was designed to be robust to the limited quality of the COVID19 data (outliers, missing counts), the procedure lacks the ability to output credibility interval based estimates. This remains a severe limitation for practical use in actual pandemic monitoring by epidemiologists that the present work aims to overcome by use of Monte Carlo sampling. After interpretation of the nonsmooth functional into a Bayesian framework, several sampling schemes are tailored to adjust the nonsmooth nature of the resulting posterior distribution. The originality of the devised algorithms stems from combining a Langevin Monte Carlo sampling scheme with Proximal operators. Performance of the new algorithms in producing relevant credibility intervals for the reproduction number estimates and denoised counts are compared. Assessment is conducted on real daily new infection counts made available by the Johns Hopkins University. The interest of the devised monitoring tools are illustrated on Covid19 data from several different countries.  © 1991-2012 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149376869&amp;doi=10.1109%2fTSP.2023.3247142&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=70ffb879cf89e91e5a0dd495476dab0e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Byzalov, D.</author><author>Basu, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The misuse of regression-based x-Scores as dependent variables</title><secondary-title>Journal of Accounting and Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Accounting and Economics</full-title></periodical><volume>77</volume><number>2-3</number><issue>2-3</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jacceco.2023.101643</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Researchers often use regression-based x-Scores (e.g., conservatism C-Score, misstatement F-Score) from a stage 1 model as a dependent variable in stage 2.

We identify nearest training examples for each evaluation example by mapping instances with generic and task-specific embedding methods. Our study on eleven classification and extractive QA tasks reveals a wide range of train-evaluation overlap, and we show that the data collection method of the dataset and the difficulty of the task may play a role in the amount of overlap.

Here we report two pre-registered direct replications (Total N = 530) of Study 2 from Thomae and Viki (2013) and assess replicability via (i) statistical significance, (ii) Bayes factors, (iii) a small-telescope approach, and (iv) a mini meta-analysis across the original and replication studies. The original results were not supported by any of the approaches. Combining both the original studies and replications yielded strong evidence in support of the null over the experimental hypothesis (Bayes factor = 0.04). The evidence provided by the current studies therefore suggests sexist jokes do not increase rape proclivity among males high in hostile sexism. We encourage researchers to continue to conduct pre-registered and open research to further understand the potential (lack of) impact of sexist humor in the future. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167437129&amp;doi=10.1515%2fhumor-2022-0134&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fc57f0b2cfec293874967d637c87a22d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Araujo, P.H.L.</author><author>Roth, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cross-functional Analysis of Generalization in Behavioral Learning</title><secondary-title>Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics</full-title></periodical><pages>1066-1081</pages><volume>11</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1162/tacl_a_00590</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In behavioral testing, system functionalities underrepresented in the standard evaluation setting (with a held-out test set) are validated through controlled input-output pairs. Optimizing performance on the behavioral tests during training (behavioral learning) would improve coverage of phenomena not sufficiently represented in the i.i.d. data and could lead to seemingly more robust models. However, there is the risk that the model narrowly captures spurious correlations from the behavioral test suite, leading to overestimation and misrepresentation of model performance— one of the original pitfalls of traditional evaluation. In this work, we introduce BELUGA, an analysis method for evaluating behavioral learning considering generalization across dimensions of different granularity levels. We optimize behavior-specific loss functions and evaluate models on several partitions of the behavioral test suite controlled to leave out specific phenomena. An aggregate score measures generalization to unseen functionalities (or overfitting). We use BELUGA to examine three representative NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, paraphrase identification, and reading comprehension) and compare the impact of a diverse set of regularization and domain generalization methods on generalization performance.1. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

Despite extensive investigation of classical and learning-based approaches in the past, robots lack common-sense knowledge about household objects and layouts. Prior state-of-the-art approaches to this task rely on learning the priors during the training and typically require significant expensive resources and time for learning. To address this, we propose a new framework for visual target navigation that leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to impart common sense for object searching. Specifically, we introduce two paradigms: (i) zero-shot and (ii) feed-forward approaches that use language to find the relevant frontier from the semantic map as a long-term goal and explore the environment efficiently. Our analyse demonstrates the notable zero-shot generalization and transfer capabilities from the use of language. Experiments on Gibson and Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing map-based methods in terms of success rate and generalization. Ablation analyse also indicates that the common-sense knowledge from the language model leads to more efficient semantic exploration. Finally, we provide a real robot experiment to verify the applicability of our framework in real-world scenarios.

However, concerns about the reproducibility of such evaluations have emerged, casting doubt on the reliability and generalisability of reported results. In this paper, we present the findings of a reproducibility study on a data-to-text system, conducted under two conditions: (1) replicating the original setup as closely as possible with evaluators from AMT, and (2) replicating the original human evaluation but this time, utilising evaluators with a background in academia. Our experiments show that there is a loss of statistical significance between the original and reproduction studies, i.e. the human evaluation results are not reproducible. In addition, we found that employing local participants led to more robust results. We finally discuss lessons learned, addressing the challenges and best practices for ensuring reproducibility in NLG human evaluations. © HumEval 2023 - Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems, associated with the 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing 2023, RANLP 2023.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184826517&amp;doi=10.26615%2f978-954-452-088-5_006&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=217bfe387d44aa8df1346ad8ebaf17fb</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mawussi, E.B.</author><author>Assah, A.K.</author><author>Kulo, E.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproduction and Milk Production Performance of Saanen Dairy Goat in Southern Togo (West Africa)</title><secondary-title>Advances in Animal and Veterinary Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Animal and Veterinary Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1028-1033</pages><volume>12</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.17582/journal.aavs/2024/12.6.1028.1033</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Milk and dairy products consumption increase in Togo due to gradual change in diet and demand of an ever-expanding population. However, local dairy production, exclusively cow’s dairy, cannot cover the needs of the country which do the powdered milk importation. To diversify dairy production, an experimental breeding of Saanen dairy goat imported from Belgium was undertaken in southern Togo early year 2020. This study evaluates reproduction and milk production performance of Saanen dairy goat raised in southern Togo. The animals are raised in permanent stable and fed with local fodders. They are subjected to veterinary care against trypanosomiasis and parasites. The mineral supplement was provided by the lick stone. Water was constantly served to the animals. The kids are fed with powdered milk replacing their mother’s milk until weaning to avoid the Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis V irus. They are fed with local fodders after weaning. Were collected through regular controls: litter size, birth weight, type of kidding (single or twin), mother’s parity, age at first kidding, interval between kidding, milk yield and lactation length. The results reveal that litter size ranged from 1 to 2 with an average of 1.37 for primiparous against 1.50 and 1.62 for multiparous. The birth weight depended to sex, parity and type of kidding and ranged from 2.55 to 3.04 kg. The age at first kidding was 450 days while the interval between births ranged from 360 to 720 days. Lactation length ranged from 157.63 to 214.41 days for milk daily production of 1.55 to 1.98 liter/goat. The study reveals Saanen dairy goat adaptation to local conditions of southern Togo. © 2024 by the authors. Licensee ResearchersLinks Ltd, England, UK.

Practitioners attempting to appropriately adapt mental healthcare and therapy provision report low confidence and inconsistency in their approach. This study contributes to the guidance by providing a shortlist of usable and priority adaptations for diagnostic and therapy services as described by multidisciplinary staff members responsible for the design and delivery of a specialist autism service in the UK. Individual freelisting interviews were conducted with 15 staff, who were asked to list the ways that they adapt their practice individually, within therapy, and collectively as a service. Salience and cultural consensus analyses demonstrated the following agreed priority service adaptations: ensuring the suitability of the service environment with consideration of sensory demands, adapting communication, knowing individual gender identity preferences and minimising client uncertainty. Detailed examples are given for flexibly adapting therapy to individual needs to inform general and specialist services.

It aims to understand why some countries performed better in vaccination coverage than others and explores the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations in conjunction with the stringency index in Africa. Methods: Two data sources were utilized. Firstly, a scoping review of relevant studies and gray literature was conducted using the Arksey H &amp; O'Malley L methodological framework. Additionally, data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT dataset) were analysed to explore the effect of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. Regression discontinuity in time was employed to assess the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on new COVID-19 cases, deaths, and reproduction rate. Results: The study found that the number of vaccinated individuals increased from March 2021, while the stringency index steadily declined since January 2021. Despite higher vaccination coverage, new COVID-19 cases and deaths peaked in late 2021 and early 2022, indicating the continued need for non-pharmaceutical interventions. After considering country fixed effects and other covariates, the number of new cases and deaths were negatively associated with the stringency index and vaccine introduction. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination was shown to be crucial in reducing new cases and deaths in Africa. However, vaccination progress in the region remains low and is influenced by factors at both structural and micro levels. Further research is required to disentangle the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions and other measures from vaccination campaigns in the context of Africa while accounting for other contributing factors. Lay summary: This study aimed to understand why some African countries did better than others in their COVID-19 vaccination efforts and how these vaccinations affected the spread of the virus. Researchers reviewed existing studies and government data along with the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. While vaccinations increased from March 2021 and strict measures eased from January 2021, new cases and deaths remained high in late 2021 and early 2022, indicating the need for additional measures. Stricter government actions and higher vaccination rates were linked to fewer cases and deaths. In Africa, COVID-19 vaccinations are crucial, but progress is slow due to various factors at both macro and individual levels. Further research is required to understand the interplay between vaccinations, other measures, and controlling the virus. © 2023 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176456505&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.hlpt.2023.100820&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2503ab74c0246e7adb7e995d421fa740</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gemignani, J.</author><author>De La Cruz-Pavía, I.</author><author>Martinez, A.</author><author>Nallet, C.</author><author>Pasquini, A.</author><author>Lucarini, G.</author><author>Cavicchiolo, F.</author><author>Gervain, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility of infant fNIRS studies: a meta-analytic approach</title><secondary-title>Neurophotonics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neurophotonics</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/1.NPh.10.2.023518</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Significance: Concerns about the reproducibility of experimental findings have recently emerged in many disciplines, from psychology to medicine and neuroscience. As NIRS is a relatively recent brain imaging technique, the question of reproducibility has not yet been systematically addressed. Aim: The current study seeks to test the replicability of effects observed in NIRS experiments assessing young infants' rule-learning ability. Approach: We conducted meta-analyses and mixed-effects modeling-based inferential statistics to determine whether effect sizes were replicable and comparable in a sample of 23 NIRS studies investigating infants' abilities to process repetition- and diversity-based regularities in linguistic and nonlinguistic auditory and visual sequences. Additionally, we tested whether effect sizes were modulated by different factors such as the age of participants or the laboratory.We obtained NIRS data from 12 published and 11 unpublished studies. The 23 studies involved a total of 487 infants, aged between 0 and 9 months, tested in four different countries (Canada, France, Italy, and USA). Results: Our most important finding is that study and laboratory were never significant moderators of variation in effect sizes, indicating that results replicated reliably across the different studies and labs included in the sample. We observed small-to-moderate effect sizes, similar to effect sizes found with other neuroimaging and behavioral techniques in the developmental literature. In line with existing findings, effect sizes were modulated by the participants' age and differed across the different regularities tested, with repetition-based regularities giving rise to the strongest effects; in particular, the overall magnitude of this effect in the left temporal region was 0.27 when analyzing the entire dataset. Conclusions: Meta-analysis is a useful tool for assessing replicability and cross-study variability. Here, we have shown that infant NIRS studies in the language domain replicate robustly across various NIRS machines, testing sites, and developmental populations.  © 2023 The Authors.

Method: The electronic databases Academic Search Premier, ProQuest Central, CINAHL Complete, and ERIC were searched for relevant articles using treatment names as keywords. Coders compared stimuli, material, design, and statistical analysis to pilot treatment approaches. Each study was coded as direct, conceptual, failed, or no replication. Results: Eighteen treatment approaches were selected for this review. A total of 188 articles met the inclusion criteria. Results revealed that 14 out of 18 treatment approaches were somehow replicated. Direct replications as the most valuable replication type for affirming previously found results were represented in only 1.5% of all studies (3/188). Failed direct replication were at 2% overall (4/ 188). Conceptual replications were more common across treatment approaches, but also represented at a low level with 22.8% (43/188). The majority of studies were coded as no replication attempt with 73.4%. Discussion: A critical factor in developing an evidence-based practice is the existence of replicated results for treatment. Replication evaluates the repro-ducibility of an author’s or authors’ research methodology and resulting outcomes and helps to ensure that observed treatment effects are reproducible. For an evidence-based treatment to be implemented or used in any clinical set-ting, it must be one that can be replicated. Direct and conceptual replications of aphasia treatment approaches were found to be alarmingly low considering the importance of replication in our field. It is recommended that replication should become more valued and mainstreamed in aphasia research. A replication database that compiles and maintains treatment manuals for replication purposes can increase the accessibility and acceptability of replications for researchers. © 2023 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159742991&amp;doi=10.1044%2f2022_JSLHR-21-00688&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bfc48d3f236b09b71965d8a7ea6b4b16</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luijken, K.</author><author>Lohmann, A.</author><author>Alter, U.</author><author>Gonzalez, J.C.</author><author>Clouth, F.J.</author><author>Fossum, J.L.</author><author>Hesen, L.</author><author>Huizing, A.H.J.</author><author>Ketelaar, J.</author><author>Montoya, A.K.</author><author>Nab, L.</author><author>Nijman, R.C.C.</author><author>Penning De Vries, B.B.L.</author><author>Tibbe, T.D.</author><author>Wang, Y.A.</author><author>Groenwold, R.H.H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replicability of simulation studies for the investigation of statistical methods: The RepliSims project</title><secondary-title>Royal Society Open Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Royal Society Open Science</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rsos.231003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Results of simulation studies evaluating the performance of statistical methods can have a major impact on the way empirical research is implemented. However, so far there is limited evidence of the replicability of simulation studies. Eight highly cited statistical simulation studies were selected, and their replicability was assessed by teams of replicators with formal training in quantitative methodology. The teams used information in the original publications to write simulation code with the aim of replicating the results. The primary outcome was to determine the feasibility of replicability based on reported information in the original publications and supplementary materials. Replicasility varied greatly: some original studies provided detailed information leading to almost perfect replication of results, whereas other studies did not provide enough information to implement any of the reported simulations. Factors facilitating replication included availability of code, detailed reporting or visualization of data-generating procedures and methods, and replicator expertise. Replicability of statistical simulation studies was mainly impeded by lack of information and sustainability of information sources. We encourage researchers publishing simulation studies to transparently report all relevant implementation details either in the research paper itself or in easily accessible supplementary material and to make their simulation code publicly available using permanent links.  © 2024 The Authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183565895&amp;doi=10.1098%2frsos.231003&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a9fcd7a5aaadd19b96fd96e3190258c3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yuan, X.</author><author>Zhang, X.</author><author>Liu, X.</author><author>Cheng, Z.</author><author>Liu, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Research Advances on Theory of Open-Environment Machine Learning</title><secondary-title>Moshi Shibie yu Rengong Zhineng/Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence</secondary-title><short-title>面向开放环境的机器学习理论研究进展</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Moshi Shibie yu Rengong Zhineng/Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence</full-title></periodical><pages>1059-1071</pages><volume>36</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.16451/j.cnki.issn1003-6059.202312001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In an open environment, machine learning is faced with various challenges, including varying category sets, non-identically distributed data and noise interference. These challenges can result in a significant decline in the performance of traditional machine learning systems built under the closed-world assumption. Therefore, open-environment machine learning is a research focus on artificial intelligence. In this paper, the current status and recent important advances in the theoretical study of open-environment machine learning are discussed from the perspectives of generalization, optimization, robustness and performance measurement. For generalization theory, the advances on the generalization performance analysis of open-set detection, transfer/meta learning and sparse learning approaches are introduced. For optimization theory, the advances on the theoretical analysis of random and sparse optimization, online and continual optimization, as well as distributed and federated optimization approaches are introduced. For robustness theory, the advances on robust learning under adversarial samples, random noise and noisy labels are introduced. For performance measurement, a number of widely used performance measurement criterions for open-environment machine learning are introduced. Finally, some prospects on the theoretical research trends of open-environment machine learning are provided. © 2023 Science Press.

Among the most prominent roles of epigenetic mechanisms is the inactivation of one of two copies of the X chromosome in females through DNA methylation. Hence, age-related disruption of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) may contribute to the aging process in women. Methods: We analyzed 9,777 CpGs on the X chromosome in whole blood samples from 2343 females and 1688 males (Illumina 450k methylation array) and replicated findings in duplicate using one whole blood and one purified monocyte data set (in total, 991/924 females/males). We used double generalized linear models to detect age-related differentially methylated CpGs (aDMCs), whose mean methylation level differs with age, and age-related variably methylated CpGs (aVMCs), whose methylation level becomes more variable with age. Results: In females, aDMCs were relatively uncommon (n = 33) and preferentially occurred in regions known to escape XCI. In contrast, many CpGs (n = 987) were found to display an increased variance with age (aVMCs). Of note, the replication rate of aVMCs was also high in purified monocytes (94%), indicating an independence of cell composition. aVMCs accumulated in CpG islands and regions subject to XCI suggesting that they stemmed from the inactive X. In males, carrying an active copy of the X chromosome only, aDMCs (n = 316) were primarily driven by cell composition, while aVMCs replicated well (95%) but were infrequent (n = 37). Conclusions: Our results imply that age-related DNA methylation differences at the inactive X chromosome are dominated by the accumulation of variability. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168752107&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs13148-023-01549-y&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e80c97f6c0790f3817da621ec07bb7c0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, H.</author><author>Zhang, D.</author><author>Wang, Y.</author><author>Ding, Y.</author><author>Yang, J.</author><author>Li, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of early improvement of major depressive disorder to antidepressant medication in adolescents with radiomics analysis after ComBat harmonization based on multiscale structural MRI</title><secondary-title>BMC Psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Psychiatry</full-title></periodical><volume>23</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12888-023-04966-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Due to individual differences and lack of objective biomarkers, only 30-40% patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) achieve remission after initial antidepressant medication (ADM). We aimed to employ radiomics analysis after ComBat harmonization to predict early improvement to ADM in adolescents with MDD by using brain multiscale structural MRI (sMRI) and identify the radiomics features with high prediction power for selection of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Methods: 121 MDD patients were recruited for brain sMRI, including three-dimensional T1 weighted imaging (3D-T1WI)and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). After receiving SSRIs or SNRIs for 2 weeks, the subjects were divided into ADM improvers (SSRIs improvers and SNRIs improvers) and non-improvers according to reduction rate of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 17 item (HAM-D17) score. Then, sMRI data were preprocessed, and conventional imaging indicators and radiomics features of gray matter (GM) based on surface-based morphology (SBM) and voxel-based morphology (VBM) and diffusion properties of white matter (WM) were extracted and harmonized with ComBat harmonization. Two-level reduction strategy with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) was utilized sequentially to decrease high-dimensional features. Support vector machine with radial basis function kernel (RBF-SVM) was used to integrate multiscale sMRI features to construct models for early improvement prediction. Area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity based on the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were calculated to evaluate the model performance. Permutation tests were used for assessing the generalization rate. Results: After 2-week ADM, 121 patients were divided into 67 ADM improvers (31 SSRIs improvers and 36 SNRIs improvers) and 54 ADM non-improvers. After two-level dimensionality reduction, 8 conventional indicators (2 VBM-based features and 6 diffusion features) and 49 radiomics features (16 VBM-based features and 33 diffusion features) were selected. The overall accuracy of RBF-SVM models based on conventional indicators and radiomics features was 74.80% and 88.19%. The radiomics model achieved the AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.889, 91.2%, 80.1% and 85.1%, 0.954, 89.2%, 87.4% and 88.5%, 0.942, 91.9%, 82.5% and 86.8% for predicting ADM improvers, SSRIs improvers and SNRIs improvers, respectively. P value of permutation tests were less than 0.001. The radiomics features predicting ADM improver were mainly located in the hippocampus, medial orbitofrontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum (lobule vii-b), body of corpus callosum, etc. The radiomics features predicting SSRIs improver were primarily distributed in hippocampus, amygdala, inferior temporal gyrus, thalamus, cerebellum (lobule vi), fornix, cerebellar peduncle, etc. The radiomics features predicting SNRIs improver were primarily located in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, ventral striatum, corpus callosum, etc. Conclusions: These findings suggest the radiomics analysis based on brain multiscale sMRI after ComBat harmonization could effectively predict the early improvement of ADM in adolescent MDD patients with a high accuracy, which was superior to the model based on the conventional indicators. The radiomics features with high prediction power may help for the individual selection of SSRIs and SNRIs. © 2023, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163376791&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12888-023-04966-8&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4219ccb6cd476268126aab7b3f09e018</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dąbrowski, J.</author><author>Letier, E.</author><author>Perini, A.</author><author>Susi, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mining and searching app reviews for requirements engineering: Evaluation and replication studies</title><secondary-title>Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Systems</full-title></periodical><volume>114</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.is.2023.102181</electronic-resource-num><abstract>App reviews provide a rich source of feature-related information that can support requirement engineering activities. Analyzing them manually to find this information, however, is challenging due to their large quantity and noisy nature. To overcome the problem, automated approaches have been proposed for ‘feature-specific analysis’. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these approaches has been evaluated using different methods and datasets. Replicating these studies to confirm their results and to provide benchmarks of different approaches is a challenging problem. We address the problem by extending previous evaluations and performing a comparison of these approaches. In this paper, we present two empirical studies. In the first study, we evaluate opinion mining approaches; the approaches extract features discussed in app reviews and identify their associated sentiments. In the second study, we evaluate approaches searching for feature-related reviews. The approaches search for users’ feedback pertinent to a particular feature. The results of both studies show these approaches achieve lower effectiveness than reported originally, and raise an important question about their practical use. © 2023 The Author(s)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147543940&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.is.2023.102181&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=cb2c4b929169b4a20fd66727ad56ac95</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slizen, V.V.</author><author>Surkova, L.K.</author><author>Gurevich, G.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>VARIABILITY ASSESSMENT OF PE_PGRS GENES AND DNA REPAIR, REPLICATION, AND RECOMBINATION GENES IN MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Medical Series</secondary-title><short-title>ИЗМЕНЧИВОСТЬ ГЕНОВ PE_PGRS И СИСТЕМЫ РЕПАРАЦИИ ДНК, РЕПЛИКАЦИИ И РЕКОМБИНАЦИЙ У MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Medical Series</full-title></periodical><pages>42-57</pages><volume>20</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.29235/1814-6023-2023-20-1-42-57</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The variability assessment of PE/PPE genes, as well as of DNA repair, replication, and recombination system genes may drive the concept of mechanisms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis evolution and adaptation. The aim is to study the variability of PE_PGRS genes, 3R-system genes (DNA repair, recombination, and replication) to assess the mechanisms of evolutionary changes in M. tuberculosis. Whole genome sequencing of M. tuberculosis 11502 (the Beijing genotype subtype B0/W148 cluster 100-32), M. tuberculosis 5005 (the Beijing genotype subtype B0/W148), M. tuberculosis 4860 (the LAM genotype) strains was performed. They were isolated from patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis. Genomes were uploaded to the GanBank, NCBI: M. tuberculosis 11502 – access code: CP070338.1, M. tuberculosis 5005 – access code: CP053092.1, M. tuberculosis 4860 – access code: CP049108.1. A reference genome (M. tuberculosis H37Rv; NC_000962.3) was used for genetic analysis. In the M. tuberculosis 11502 genome, 44.4 ± 6.8 % of genes (24 genes out of 54) were revealed in the mutations related to the 3R system, while in M. tuberculosis 4860– 29.6 ± 6.2 % (16 genes out of 54). In the 3R system genes, a slight shift of mutations towards replacement by adenine and thymine was revealed, while the entire genome of M. tuberculosis 11502 (compared to M. tuberculosis H37Rv) demonstrated mutations, resulting in a slight accumulation of G + C. Mutations in the 3R system genes may lead to the suboptimal activity of proteins responsible for the DNA-repair, resulting in the upsurge of mutation frequency and promoting adaptive evolution. PE_PGRS genes in the genome of M. tuberculosis 11502, 4860, and 5005 exhibited a high variability and their variability diverged among different members of this gene family. A high level of tetranucleotides CGGC was found in the majority of PE_PGRS family genes, where their proportion varied from 2.11 to 8.42 %, while an average proportion of CGGC in the M. tuberculosis genome was 1.62 %. Some genes in the M. tuberculosis genome were detected to carry no tetranucleotides CGGC (Rv0011, Rv0100, Rv0460, Rv0616A, Rv0691A, Rv0722, Rv0863, Rv0909, Rv1038c, Rv1197, Rv2347c, Rv2452c, and Rv3330c). The DNA conformation analysis at the mutation sites in the genes, associated with resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs, showed that the secondary DNA structures were mainly formed by nucleotides CGGC, GCGC, GGG, GGGG, CTGC, and mutations occurred, predominantly, at the sites of forming secondary DNA structures (hairpins) where the redistribution of energy and charges can influence the accuracy of replication and result in replication errors and a mutation event. A number of additional factors can influence the probability of a mutation event. These are the factors that can neutralize the energy changes in the DNA secondary structures, and can affect the accuracy of DNA-repair and replication (mutations in the gyrA gene, in the 3R-system genes). © Medical series, 2023.

Here, we propose that overgeneralizing alcohol-related associations characterizes risky drinking. We conducted two online experiments assessing generalization of alcohol-related gains (Study 1) and losses (Study 2) among individuals who engaged in light or risky patterns of drinking (Study 1: N = 88, 24–44 years old; Study 2: N = 87, 21–44 years old). After learning to associate cards with alcohol and non-alcohol-related outcomes, participants chose whether to play with cards varying in perceptual similarity to those shown during conditioning. Finally, participants completed a surprise recognition memory test for all outcomes. Although both groups showed comparable conditioning, we found that risky drinkers overgeneralized alcohol-related gains and losses. Risky drinkers also showed a bias toward recognizing alcohol-related images. These results indicate a novel role for overgeneralization of alcohol-related gains and losses as a mechanism associated with risky drinking. © The Author(s) 2023.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170536971&amp;doi=10.1177%2f09567976231181516&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c2595627e531141334d7149e637a98f2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Andrade, J.M.L.</author><author>Moreno, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving the Estimation of Object mass from images</title><secondary-title>2023 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Robot Systems and Competitions, ICARSC 2023</secondary-title></titles><pages>199-206</pages><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICARSC58346.2023.10129573</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Image2mass and Pix2Vox++ are works that focus on the estimation of mass and the shape of objects in images, respectively. Having the aid of the Pix2Vox++ in mind, the proposed work aims to further explore the image2mass's architecture by modifying its mass estimation pipeline. This pipeline contains a Geometry Module which estimates a thickness mask and 14 geometric features and uses them to predict the density and volume of objects, which result in the mass value when multiplied.Firstly, in this work we present a method to turn the output of the Pix2Vox++ into a thickness mask and 14 features, analogous to image2mass. Secondly, it is fine-tuned the Pix2Vox++ architecture with different configurations, using a dataset called GraspNet. The three best Pix2Vox++ models are then chosen to substitute, or aid, the Geometry Module, and the image2mass is fine-tuned using the same dataset. Additionally, texture randomization is executed to evaluate the generalization of results given the variability of the input data.The results demonstrate that the Pix2Vox++ help the image2mass to achieve a better performance. The fine-tuning configurations of both models, however, should be further explored.  © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162007489&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICARSC58346.2023.10129573&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2354f4b4e52bd01393b3fdb224e049c0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ito, T.</author><author>Gatt, A.</author><author>Fang, Q.</author><author>Mosteiro, P.</author><author>van Deemter, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Challenges in Reproducing Human Evaluation Results for Role-Oriented Dialogue Summarization</title><secondary-title>HumEval 2023 - Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems, associated with the 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing 2023, RANLP 2023</secondary-title></titles><pages>97-123</pages><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.26615/978-954-452-088-5_009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There is a growing concern regarding the reproducibility of human evaluation studies in NLP. As part of the ReproHum campaign, we conducted a study to assess the reproducibility of a recent human evaluation study in NLP. Specifically, we attempted to reproduce a human evaluation of a novel approach to enhance Role-Oriented Dialogue Summarization by considering the influence of role interactions. Despite our best efforts to adhere to the reported setup, we were unable to reproduce the statistical results as presented in the original paper. While no contradictory evidence was found, our study raises questions about the validity of the reported statistical significance results, and/or the comprehensiveness with which the original study was reported. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive account of our reproduction study, detailing the methodologies employed, data collection, and analysis procedures. We discuss the implications of our findings for the broader issue of reproducibility in NLP research.

Methods: Sampling was carried out using gillnets in rivers, and open and closed lagoons, in March, June, September, and December 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 and March and September 2017. A total of 442 females were sampled and 111 subsampled, each of which had an ovary removed and fixed in Bouin solution. A subsample of 20 ovaries in the spawning capable phase were fixed in a 4% buffered formaldehyde solution to estimate the diameter of the oocytes and fecundity. The ovaries were dehydrated, embedded in historesin, cut, stained, and evaluated as regards folliculogenesis, oogenesis, development phases, and reproduction areas. Results: The germ cells recorded were differentiated oogonia, primary and secondary growth oocytes, fully-grown and mature oocytes, and post-ovulatory follicles that permitted the recognition of the reproductive phases. Oocyte diameter information revealed that the species has group synchronous oocyte development, determinate fecundity and batch spawning, and eliminates an average of 38,490 oocytes. Conclusions: The fact that Leporinus lacustris is reproductively successful in the Baía River and in the Fechada, Guaraná, Patos, Garças, Ventura and Ressaco do Pau Véio lagoons strengthens the importance of the areas of environmental protection of the islands and lowlands of the Paraná River, Ilha Grande National Park and Ivinheima River State Park. © 2024, Sociedade Brasileira de Limnologia.

The estimation process is first decomposed into feature extraction and feature exploitation. The feature extraction is seen as a dimension reduction process, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to ensure accuracy. Feature exploitation is considered as a policy optimization process, and a shallow reinforcement learning (RL)-based feature exploitation module is proposed to improve running rapidity. Ablation studies and experiments are carried out on NYU and ICVL datasets to evaluate the performance of the strategy, and multiple baselines are used to evaluate generalization. The results show that the improvement on testing time reaches 8.1 % and 14.6 % by the proposed strategy. Note that the overall accuracy also reaches state-of-the-art, which further shows the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152521896&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-27077-2_28&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3b3ebe733f6a3fe33d301b89e791aebf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wei, F.</author><author>Meng, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Study on the role of histone epigenetic modification in replication of hepatitis B virus</title><secondary-title>Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>669</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.05.045</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem and lacks effective therapies in clinic. This study attempted to investigate the role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in HBV replication. Cells were treated with 1.3 folds of HBV genome. The expression patterns of HDAC3, miR-29a-3p, and nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) in cells were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. HBV replication was assessed by measurements of HBV DNA, HBV RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis B E antigen. After chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays to testify gene interactions, rescue experiments and animal experiments were performed to assess the role of miR-29a-3p/NFAT5 in HBV replication and the role of HDAC3 in vivo. HDAC3 level was decreased by pHBV1.3 plasmid in a concentration-dependent manner. HDAC3 overexpression can inhibit HBV replication, which was neutralized by miR-29a-3p overexpression or NFAT5 downregulation. Mechanically, HDAC3 overexpression reduced the enrichment of histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation on the miR-29a-3p promoter to inhibit miR-29a-3p expression and then promote NFAT5 transcription. In vivo, HDAC3 restrained HBV replication through the miR-29a-3p/NFAT5 axis. Overall, HDAC3 downregulation was associated with HBV replication and HDAC3 overexpression inhibited HBV replication through H3K9ac/miR-29a-3p/NFAT5. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160078485&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.bbrc.2023.05.045&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=466934ebb471e7c6fe766b2f2fb193fa</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Neasham, P.J.</author><author>Pliasas, V.C.</author><author>North, J.F.</author><author>Johnson, C.</author><author>Tompkins, S.M.</author><author>Kyriakis, C.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development and characterization of an immortalized swine respiratory cell line for influenza A virus research</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2023.1258269</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction: Swine serve as an important intermediate host species for generating novel influenza A viruses (IAVs) with pandemic potential because of the host’s susceptibility to IAVs of swine, human and avian origin. Primary respiratory cell lines are used in IAV research to model the host’s upper respiratory tract in vitro. However, primary cell lines are limited by their passaging capacity and are time-consuming for use in industry and research pipelines. We were interested in developing and characterizing a biologically relevant immortalized swine respiratory cell line that could be used for efficient propagation and characterization of swine IAV isolates. Methods: Lung tissue for the generation of primary swine respiratory cells were isolated from the bronchi of an 8-week-old Yorkshire/Hampshire pig, which were immortalized by transduction of the SV40 T antigen using a lentivirus vector. The transduction of the SV40 T antigen was confirmed by Real Time RT-PCR in cells passaged greater than twenty times. Results: Immortalized swine respiratory cells expressed primarily α2,6 sialic acid receptors and were susceptible to both swine and human IAVs, with swine viruses exhibiting higher replication rates. Notably, infection with a swine H3N2 isolate prompted increased IL-6 and IL-1α protein secretion compared to a seasonal human H3N2 virus. Even after 20 passages, the immortalized cells maintained the primary respiratory cell phenotype and remained permissive to IAV infection without exogenous trypsin. Discussion: In summary, our developed immortalized swine respiratory cell line offers an alternative in vitro substrate for studying IAV replication and transmission dynamics in pigs, overcoming the limitations of primary respiratory cells in terms of low passage survivability and cost.

Empirically, such predictions usually rely on a validation set, while recent works showed that an unlabeled validation set also works. Without validation sets, it is extremely difficult to obtain non-vacuous generalization bounds, which leads to a weaker task of finding generalization measures that monotonically relate to generalization error. In this paper, we propose a new generalization measure REF Complexity (RElative Fitting degree between signal and noise), motivated by the intuition that a given model-algorithm pair may generalize well if it fits signal (e.g., true labels) fast while fitting noise (e.g., random labels) slowly. Empirically, REF Complexity monotonically relates to test accuracy in real-world datasets without accessing additional validation sets, achieving −0.988 correlation on CIFAR-10 and −0.960 correlation on CIFAR-100. We further theoretically verify the utility of REF Complexity under three different cases, including convex and smooth regimes with stochastic gradient descent, smooth regimes (not necessarily convex) with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, and linear regimes with gradient descent.

The generalization function is typically assumed to be of Gaussian shape, centered on the planned motion, although more recent studies associate generalization with the actual motion. Because motor learning is thought to involve multiple adaptive processes with different time constants, we hypothesized that these processes have different time-dependent contributions to the generalization. Guided by a model-based approach, the objective of the present study was to experimentally examine these contributions. We first reformulated a validated two-state adaptation model as a combination of weighted motor primitives, each specified as a Gaussian-shaped tuning function. Adaptation in this model is achieved by updating individual weights of the primitives of the fast and slow adaptive process separately. Depending on whether updating occurred in a plan-referenced or a motion-referenced manner, the model predicted distinct contributions to the overall generalization by the slow and fast process. We tested 23 participants in a reach adaptation task, using a spontaneous recovery paradigm consisting of five successive blocks of a long adaptation phase to a viscous force field, a short adaptation phase with the opposite force, and an error-clamp phase. Generalization was assessed in 11 movement directions relative to the trained target direction. Results of our participant population fell within a continuum of evidence for plan-referenced to evidence for motion-referenced updating. This mixture may reflect the differential weighting of explicit and implicit compensation strategies among participants. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Error-based reach adaptation can be modeled by fast and slow adaptive processes. Using a spontaneous recovery paradigm and model-based analyses, we tested how these processes generalize during force-field reach adaptation. Depending on whether the fast and slow adaptive processes operate by crediting the planned or actual motion, the model predicts distinct contributions of them to the overall generalization function. We show that human participants fall within a continuum of evidence for plan-referenced to motion-referenced updating. © 2023 American Physiological Society.

The largest epizootic ever recorded in Europe was caused by HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses in the period 2021–2022. The recent H5-clade 2.3.4.4 viruses were found to differ in their virulence for chickens and ducks. Viruses causing only mild disease may remain undetected, increasing the risk of virus spread to other farms, wild birds and mammals. We developed in ovo models to determine the virulence of HPAI viruses for chickens and ducks, which are fast and have low costs. The virulence of five contemporary H5-viruses was compared studying replication rate, average time to death and virus spread in the embryo. Remarkable differences in virulence were observed between H5-viruses and between poultry species. The H5N1-2021 virus was found to have a fast replication rate in both the chicken and duck in ovo models, but a slower systemic virus dissemination compared to three other H5-clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. The results show the potential of in ovo models to quickly determine the virulence of novel HPAI viruses, and study potential virulence factors which can help to better guide the surveillance in poultry. © 2024 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191558190&amp;doi=10.3390%2fv16040563&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=63a2f1e6ec5e6aee1e6e8e49a674c69c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wanat, R.</author><author>Carpenter, A.</author><author>Smith, M.D.</author><author>Hattori, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Method of Evaluating Luminance Reproduction Accuracy of Displays for Complex Imagery</title><secondary-title>SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>45-54</pages><volume>132</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5594/JMI.2023.3277943</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Modern displays utilize complex light emission systems to allow for high dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut image reproduction. This results in luminance and contrast distribution across the screen that is not only highly dependent on the image content, but also difficult to accurately measure and predict. The perceptual effects of these shortcomings are partially masked in consumer displays by the spatiotemporal limitations of the human visual system (HVS). However, in the case of color-critical applications such as color grading using professional displays, inaccurate reproduction of image luminance, and contrast can drive creative choices that would not have been made otherwise. In this article, we describe a measurement procedure and analysis aimed at subjectively and objectively determining the ability of a display to accurately reproduce image luminance. The procedure uses a high-resolution imaging light-measuring device (LMD) to capture per-pixel luminance on a screen and compare it against the luminance distribution of the source image. The procedure includes steps for registering the image measured by the LMD to the reference image, compensating for lens distortions, and simulating the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the lens. The article also contains example results collected for two displays along with an analysis of their performance. The test content used in the measurement contains a combination of synthetic imagery and camera-captured, color-graded content. We have developed the procedure for color-critical applications to evaluate the performance of displays and determine luminance reproduction accuracy across complex scenes.  © 2002 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164567849&amp;doi=10.5594%2fJMI.2023.3277943&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=cee08ddb2d1518cc0cab95f7d7ba3783</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bouck, E.</author><author>Long, H.</author><author>Bae, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring the Virtual-Representational-Abstract Instructional Sequence Across the Learning Stages for Struggling Students</title><secondary-title>Behavior Modification</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Behavior Modification</full-title></periodical><pages>590-614</pages><volume>47</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/01454455221129998</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In recent years, virtual manipulatives have been explored and used as an alternative to concrete manipulatives in mathematics for students on their own and as part of manipulative-based instructional sequences. Researchers examining virtual manipulative-based instructional sequences tend to focus on students documented with disabilities, as opposed to students at-risk or struggling with mathematics, as well as students’ acquisition of the target skill, despite students experiencing learning in four stages: acquisition, fluency, maintenance, and generalization. This study explored the virtual-representational-abstract (VRA) instructional sequence across four stages of learning for three elementary students struggling in mathematics. In the single-case design study, researchers found a functional relationship between the VRA instructional sequence delivered online via explicit instruction and students’ computational accuracy in their targeted area of mathematics need. Researchers also found limited influence on fluency rate or generalization to word problem accuracy but that students did maintain. © The Author(s) 2022.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142218125&amp;doi=10.1177%2f01454455221129998&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8999ccb26ef262892955965bd6bc8b98</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, R.</author><author>Zhou, J.</author><author>Lu, X.</author><author>Shen, J.</author><author>Chen, H.</author><author>Chen, M.</author><author>He, Y.</author><author>Liu, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A robust rice yield estimation framework developed by grading modeling and normalized weight decision-making strategy using UAV imaging technology</title><secondary-title>Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</full-title></periodical><volume>215</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.compag.2023.108417</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Rice yield estimation is of great significance for ensuring food security and breeding new varieties with high yield and good stress resistance. The popular yield estimation method is to combine unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images to extract vegetation index (VI) for multi-variable regression, whose application is always limited by expensive equipment and complex data processing. In this study, based on the deep learning network, ConvNeXt, a robust framework developed by grading modeling and normalized weight decision-making strategy was innovatively proposed to estimate the rice yield, only using RGB images collected by UAVs. The main results are: (1) the yield estimation performance of yield grading model was better than that of regression model, and R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) on the test dataset using the grading model were 0.97, 410.94 kg/ha, and 3.96 % respectively; (2) the confidence scores of the grading model were adopted as the weights, which could correct the estimated yield of the misclassified samples and further reduce the estimated error. The normalized weight decision-making after optimization had obvious advantages, the performance of 2-weight strategy was the best, whose R2, MAE, and MAPE reached 0.98, 386.08 kg/ha, and 3.79 %, respectively; (3) the MAPE results of generalization assessment showed that the generalization of the grading (12.98 %) and regression (10.88 %) models was inferior to the proposed framework (8.71 %), which could reduce the MAPE on the generalization evaluation dataset to less than 10 %. Furthermore, the framework exhibited good adaptability when applied to the rice yield estimation of the new data in 2022, with an MAPE of 4.54 %. Considering both application potential and adaptability, this framework constructs a novel strategy and method for rice yield estimation using grading modeling and normalized weight decision-making strategy, which provides a reference for future real-time and precise yield estimation using UAV remote sensing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178902649&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.compag.2023.108417&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3e9c298bc64899482d1dad55f8f7caa6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Y.</author><author>Lai, H.</author><author>Toral, A.</author><author>Nissim, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Same Trends, Different Answers: Insights from a Replication Study of Human Plausibility Judgments on Narrative Continuations</title><secondary-title>HumEval 2023 - Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems, associated with the 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing 2023, RANLP 2023</secondary-title></titles><pages>190-203</pages><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.26615/978-954-452-088-5_015</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We reproduced the human-based evaluation of the continuation of narratives task presented by Chakrabarty et al.

Purpose: Assess how the nursing students’ participation in critiquing Canadian empirical evidence on men's health literacy provokes new perceptions; explore students’ intentions of incorporating the aforementioned contents into their professional practice; and test students’ skills to formulate a hypothetical short action plan about men's health literacy. Methods: A qualitative evaluation study inspired by the qualitative program evaluation approach. The setting was a university-based Canadian undergraduate nursing program located in a major metropolitan city. Seventeen undergraduate students (representing 3.65% of year 4 student population) composed the sample. The educational intervention was two workshops (6 h duration; February 2017) including a lecture about men's health literacy with video presentations, class discussions and group work using Freire's method of reflection and discussion for awareness awakening. Hypothetical health literacy promotion was the key outcome. All interactions were digitally audiorecorded, verbatim transcribed and submitted to thematic analysis having as themes: Perspectives of awareness and knowledge expansion, and New personal-professional assets. Results: Students were able to relate new knowledge with their own experiences in the classroom or in the practicum. Application of new knowledge was related to students’ social circles and reported familiar health matters. Cultural and community life shaped knowledge expansion and references to men's behaviors. Conclusions: Mobilization of personal knowledge awoke students’ awareness about gaps in the nursing curriculum and the paucity of experiences in clinical placements relating to men's health literacy. © The Author(s) 2022.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163725226&amp;doi=10.1177%2f08445621221144131&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9a989f818c1ff8748c29cd023c4da01b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Z.</author><author>Zhang, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Review of Research on Generalization Error Analysis of Deep Learning Models</title><secondary-title>2023 International Conference on Image Processing, Computer Vision and Machine Learning, ICICML 2023</secondary-title></titles><pages>906-912</pages><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICICML60161.2023.10424837</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Generalization error is used to quantify the predictive ability of models on unseen datasets, which are obtained from learning based on training datasets. The generalization ability is one of the core performances of the learning models. The characteristics of large-scale parameters and low interpretability of deep learning have challenged the traditional generalization error analysis methods based on PAC learning theory. By combing the research results of generalization ability of deep learning models in recent years, the shortcomings of the conventional generalization error analysis theory are summarized and the current research on quantifying the generalization error of deep learning models is investigated. Finally, the application and development direction of generalization error analysis of deep learning models are prospected. © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186495390&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICICML60161.2023.10424837&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c34d96d3112ee6cc07b64638784afd14</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson, B.M.</author><author>Wixted, J.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Importance of Modeling the Invisible World of Underlying Effect Sizes</title><secondary-title>Social Psychological Bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Social Psychological Bulletin</full-title></periodical><volume>18</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.32872/SPB.9981</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The headline findings from the Open Science Collaboration (2015)-namely, that 36% of original experiments replicated at p &lt; .05, with the overall replication effect sizes being half as large as the original effects-cannot be meaningfully interpreted without a formal model. A simple modelbased approach might ask: what would the state of original science be and what would replication results show if original experiments tested true effects half the time (prior odds = 1), true effects had a medium effect size (Cohen's Δ = 0.50), and power to detect true effects was 50%? Assuming no questionable research practices, 91% of p &lt; .05 findings in the original literature would be true positives. However, only 58% of original p &lt; .05 findings would be expected to replicate using the Open Science Collaboration approach, and the replication effects overall would be only ~60% as large as the original effects. A minor variant of this model yields an expected replication rate of only 45%, with overall replication effect sizes dropping by half. If the state of original science is as grim as a non-model-based (i.e., intuitive) interpretation of the Open Science Collaboration data suggests, should it be this easy to largely account for those findings using a model in which 91% of statistically significant findings in the original science literature are true positives? Claims that the findings reported by the Open Science Collaboration indicate a replication crisis should not be based solely on intuition but should instead be accompanied by a specific model that supports that interpretation. © 2023 American Academy of Pediatrics.

There is mixed evidence suggesting that training these abilities may improve aspects of driving performance. This preliminary study investigated the feasibility of training three-dimensional multiple object tracking (3D-MOT)—a dynamic, speeded tracking task soliciting selective, sustained and divided attention as well as speed of processing—to improve measures of simulated driving performance in older and younger adults. A sample of 20 young adults (23–33 years old) and 14 older adults (65–76 years old) were randomly assigned to either a 3D-MOT training group or an active control group trained on a perceptual discrimination task as well as 2048. Participants were tested on a driving scenario with skill-testing events previously identified as optimal for cross-sectional comparisons of driving ability. Results replicated previously identified differences in driving behaviour between age groups. A possible trend was observed for the 3D-MOT trained group, especially younger adults, to increase the distance at which they applied their maximum amount of braking in response to dangerous events. This measure was associated with less extreme braking during events, implying that these drivers may have been making more controlled stops. Limitations of sample size and task realism notwithstanding, the present experiment offers preliminary evidence that 3D-MOT training might transfer to driving performance through quicker detection of or reaction to dangerous events and provides a rationale for replication with a larger sample size. © 2023, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169123906&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs41465-023-00260-3&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=13a4132629550aeb160728c61550ccfb</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Howard, C.B.</author><author>Rabinovitch, A.</author><author>Yehezkel, G.</author><author>Zaritsky, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tight coupling of cell width to nucleoid structure in Escherichia coli</title><secondary-title>Biophysical Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biophysical Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>502-508</pages><volume>123</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bpj.2024.01.015</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cell dimensions of rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli are connected to mass growth and chromosome replication. During their interdivision cycle (τ min), cells enlarge by elongation only, but at faster growth in richer media, they are also wider. Changes in width W upon nutritional shift-up (shortening τ) occur during the division process. The elusive signal directing the mechanism for W determination is likely related to the tightly linked duplications of the nucleoid (DNA) and the sacculus (peptidoglycan), the only two structures (macromolecules) existing in a single copy that are coupled, temporally and spatially. Six known parameters related to the nucleoid structure and replication are reasonable candidates to convey such a signal, all simple functions of the key number of replication positions n(=C/τ), the ratio between the rates of growth (τ−1) and of replication (C−1). The current analysis of available literature-recorded data discovered that, of these, nucleoid complexity NC[=(2n−1)/(n×ln2)] is by far the most likely parameter affecting cell width W. The exceedingly high correlations found between these two seemingly unrelated measures (NC and W) indicate that coupling between them is of major importance to the species’ survival. As an exciting corollary, to the best of our knowledge, a new, indirect approach to estimate DNA replication rate is revealed. Potential involvement of DNA topoisomerases in W determination is also proposed and discussed. © 2024 Biophysical Society</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184001123&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.bpj.2024.01.015&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7d1ad621a479bf7f80de01bd1f141db8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kedron, P.</author><author>Bardin, S.</author><author>Holler, J.</author><author>Gilman, J.</author><author>Grady, B.</author><author>Seeley, M.</author><author>Wang, X.</author><author>Yang, W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Framework for Moving Beyond Computational Reproducibility: Lessons from Three Reproductions of Geographical Analyses of COVID-19</title><secondary-title>Geographical Analysis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geographical Analysis</full-title></periodical><pages>163-184</pages><volume>56</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gean.12370</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Despite recent calls to make geographical analyses more reproducible, formal attempts to reproduce or replicate published work remain largely absent from the geographic literature. The reproductions of geographic research that do exist typically focus on computational reproducibility—whether results can be recreated using data and code provided by the authors—rather than on evaluating the conclusion and internal validity and evidential value of the original analysis. However, knowing if a study is computationally reproducible is insufficient if the goal of a reproduction is to identify and correct errors in our knowledge. We argue that reproductions of geographic work should focus on assessing whether the findings and claims made in existing empirical studies are well supported by the evidence presented. We aim to facilitate this transition by introducing a model framework for conducting reproduction studies, demonstrating its use, and reporting the findings of three exemplar studies. We present three model reproductions of geographical analyses of COVID-19 based on a common, open access template. Each reproduction attempt is published as an open access repository, complete with pre-analysis plan, data, code, and final report. We find each study to be partially reproducible, but moving past computational reproducibility, our assessments reveal conceptual and methodological concerns that raise questions about the predictive value and the magnitude of the associations presented in each study. Collectively, these reproductions and our template materials offer a practical framework others can use to reproduce and replicate empirical spatial analyses and ultimately facilitate the identification and correction of errors in the geographic literature. © 2023 The Authors.

BACKGROUND Replication practices are important features supporting the science of nursing education. The absence of replication studies in the wider education community raises questions about the potential for similar absences in nursing education. As such, an investigation into replication practices within nursing education provides directions for future discussion. METHOD Using Scopus and databases of nursing education journals, three search strategies were launched to assess replication practices using bibliometric data and content analysis. RESULTS Inconsistency in definitions of the term replication creates barriers to recognizing replication attempts in the body of literature. Based on bibliometric data and content analysis, conceptual replication appears to be common in highly cited nursing education research. CONCLUSION Within the academic nursing community, consensus on the meaning of the term and promotion of practices that support replication is recommended.  © Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153802737&amp;doi=10.1097%2f01.NEP.0000000000001116&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ac32e892e330d54680483a79e982a8d5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Y.</author><author>Bao, T.</author><author>Huang, X.</author><author>Wang, R.</author><author>Shu, X.</author><author>Xu, B.</author><author>Tu, J.</author><author>Zhou, Y.</author><author>Zhang, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An integrated underwater structural multi-defects automatic identification and quantification framework for hydraulic tunnel via machine vision and deep learning</title><secondary-title>Structural Health Monitoring</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Structural Health Monitoring</full-title></periodical><pages>2360-2383</pages><volume>22</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/14759217221122316</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Underwater structural defects in hydraulic tunnels are highly concealed and difficult to be identified by conventional manual methods. Remotely operated vehicle combined with visible light cameras can provide a noncontact and high spatial resolution damage detection solution. However, manually extracting useful structural damage-related information from massive data is time-consuming and involves high labor cost. This article proposes an integrated pixel-level underwater structural multi-defects instance segmentation and quantification framework for hydraulic tunnels via machine vision and deep learning. Firstly, a tunnel lining underwater structural multi-defects video dataset is developed. Next, an improved You Only Look At CoefficienTs for Edge devices is used to build the detector by exploiting temporal redundancy in videos. Three backbone detectors are used to trade off the balance between detection accuracy and efficiency, and a cross-domain transfer learning strategy is introduced to reduce model training costs and data dependencies. Various complicated tunnel underwater inspection scenarios, including uneven illumination, tilt shooting, high brightness, and motion blur scenarios, are used to evaluate model generalization capability. Experimental results show that ResNet50-based YolactEdge can well trade off the balance between accuracy and speed, which achieves 92.47 bbox mAP, 92.15 mask mAP, and 39.27 FPS in the testing set. A quantification evaluation method is proposed to quantify the detection results and extract the geometric features of structural defects based on digital image processing techniques. The proposed method can accurately identify the number, size, and area of tunnel underwater structural defects, providing data support for subsequent reinforcement. © The Author(s) 2022.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139058292&amp;doi=10.1177%2f14759217221122316&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1498666bd5e42ad324d0fe3a451294d9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Williams, T.M.</author><author>Krueger-Hadfield, S.A.</author><author>Hill-Spanik, K.M.</author><author>Kosaki, R.K.</author><author>Stoeckel, S.</author><author>Spalding, H.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The reproductive system of the cryptogenic alga Chondria tumulosa (Florideophyceae) at Manawai, Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument</title><secondary-title>Phycologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Phycologia</full-title></periodical><pages>36-44</pages><volume>63</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00318884.2023.2284074</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Determining the relative importance of sexual and asexual reproduction is critical for determining how genetic diversity is partitioned within and among populations. Macroalgae exhibit reproductive system variability, with many species capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Thus, rates of fragmentation (asexual) versus sporic recruitment (sexual) must be quantified. This is critical during range expansions when shifts to uniparental reproduction are common. Chondria tumulosa is a cryptogenic red alga that was discovered forming thick mats at Manawai, in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, during opportunistic sampling in 2019. It reduced the biodiversity and abundance of associated coral reef organisms. To characterize the reproductive system of C. tumulosa in this atoll, we visually assessed 124 thallus clumps for reproductive structures and used five microsatellite loci to genotype 41 thalli. All thalli bearing reproductive structures (20%) and all thalli that were genotyped were tetrasporophytes. No gametophytic thalli were observed using microscopy or microsatellite genotyping, though 80% of thalli observed under the microscope were vegetative. We observed in situ thallus fragmentation supported by the presence of 17 repeated genotypes and other genetic signatures, suggesting high rates of asexual reproduction. These results suggest that C. tumulosa is partially clonal in this atoll and has the potential for spreading to other nearby atolls. Rapid establishment, thallus fragmentation and tetrasporophytic dominance are consistent with other red macroalgal invasions studied to date. Understanding the reproductive system is an important component of developing management strategies for this alga and expanding our understanding of the population genetics of partially clonal taxa. © 2023 The Author(s).

New advances in metabolomics can provide biochemical insights into the early development of obesity, so we aimed to characterize serum metabolites associated with overweight and adiposity in early childhood and to stratify associations by sex. Methods: Nontargeted metabolite profiling was conducted in the Canadian CHILD birth cohort (discovery cohort) at age 5 years (n = 900) by multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Clinical outcome was defined using novel combined measures of overweight (WHO-standardized body mass index ≥ 85th percentile) and/or adiposity (waist circumference ≥ 90th percentile). Associations between circulating metabolites and child overweight/adiposity (binary and continuous outcomes) were determined by multivariable linear and logistic regression, adjusting for covariates and false discovery rate, and by subsequent sex-stratified analysis. Replication was assessed in an independent replication cohort called FAMILY at age 5 years (n = 456). Results: In the discovery cohort, each standard deviation (SD) increment of branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, glutamic acid, threonine, and oxoproline was associated with 20–28% increased odds of overweight/adiposity, whereas each SD increment of the glutamine/glutamic acid ratio was associated with 20% decreased odds. All associations were significant in females but not in males in sex-stratified analyses, except for oxoproline that was not significant in either subgroup. Similar outcomes were confirmed in the replication cohort, where associations of aromatic amino acids, leucine, glutamic acid, and the glutamine/glutamic acid ratio with childhood overweight/adiposity were independently replicated. Conclusions: Our findings show the utility of combining measures of both overweight and adiposity in young children. Childhood overweight/adiposity at age 5 years has a specific serum metabolic phenotype, with the profile being more prominent in females compared to males. © 2023, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158073739&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12916-023-02886-8&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f0839ff8168e3cb032fb82df1cbf0476</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, S.</author><author>Ibrahim, M.S.</author><author>Wahab, A.</author><author>Khan, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GMDM: A generalized multi-dimensional distribution overlap metric for data and model quality evaluation</title><secondary-title>Digital Signal Processing: A Review Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Digital Signal Processing: A Review Journal</full-title></periodical><volume>134</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dsp.2023.103930</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this article, we design and analyze a generalized multi-dimensional distribution overlap metric (GMDM) as a generic tool for quantifying similarity or difference between two multivariate distributions for the evaluation of data and model quality. Our experiments on different real-world datasets substantiate that the proposed metric is an apposite intuitive alternative for quantification of the performance of training models and the consistency of multiple datasets. The proposed metric is suitable, for example, for image quality assessment, evaluation of unsupervised training models trained using unpaired data, image denoising models, feature embedding in protein sequence classification, and the estimation of class-specific consistency in datasets of variable dimensions such as the MNIST, ORL, and CIFAR. Furthermore, it is substantiated that the proposed metric can serve as a batch-wise consistency score to evaluate the reproducibility of the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based molecule identification model and is also applied to the domain adaptation problem in the anomaly detection task. Our results on diverse applications confirm the generalization of the proposed method and indicate a good agreement of the GMDM with conventional data quality and performance metrics. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146985239&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.dsp.2023.103930&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=29365dd3aa9304fc7c953fa8f8b9a748</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, F.</author><author>Wang, P.</author><author>Zhang, L.</author><author>Wei, W.</author><author>Zhang, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Revisiting Prototypical Network for Cross Domain Few-Shot Learning</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</secondary-title></titles><pages>20061-20070</pages><volume>2023-June</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01921</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Prototypical Network is a popular few-shot solver that aims at establishing a feature metric generalizable to novel few-shot classification (FSC) tasks using deep neural networks. However, its performance drops dramatically when generalizing to the FSC tasks in new domains. In this study, we revisit this problem and argue that the devil lies in the simplicity bias pitfall in neural networks. In specific, the network tends to focus on some biased shortcut features (e.g., color, shape, etc.) that are exclusively sufficient to distinguish very few classes in the meta-training tasks within a pre-defined domain, but fail to generalize across domains as some desirable semantic features. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Local-global Distillation Prototypical Network (LDP-net). Different from the standard Prototypical Network, we establish a two-branch network to classify the query image and its random local crops, respectively. Then, knowledge distillation is conducted among these two branches to enforce their class affiliation consistency. The rationale behind is that since such global-local semantic relationship is expected to hold regardless of data domains, the local-global distillation is beneficial to exploit some cross-domain transferable semantic features for feature metric establishment. Moreover, such local-global semantic consistency is further enforced among different images of the same class to reduce the intra-class semantic variation of the resultant feature. In addition, we propose to update the local branch as Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over training episodes, which makes it possible to better distill cross-episode knowledge and further enhance the generalization performance. Experiments on eight cross-domain FSC benchmarks empirically clarify our argument and show the state-of-the-art results of LDP-net.

To prove the validity of the proposed method, we use the channels modelled by different standards and fading modelling for simulation. We also use an attention-based structure and a convolutional neural network to evaluate the generalization results achieved.

Unlike the conventional automatic evaluation method of English translation content, the translation quality estimation method does not use manual reference translation to evaluate the ability of English translation. However, according to the content quality estimation of the current sentences in English translation, the feature information extraction method lacks the generalization analysis of linguistic research, which also affects the use of subsequent vector regression methods. Therefore, the feature information of the vocabulary vector is studied to obtain the context vocabulary prediction model and matrix analysis model of deep learning. They are combined with the recursive neural network language modeling to enhance the reliability of the independent estimation and manual evaluation of translation quality. The experimental results using the data set of the sub-task of translation content quality estimation in WMT 15 and WMT 16 show that the method of obtaining the feature of sentence vector through context lexical analysis is consistently more effective than the original QuEst method and the feature acquisition method of sentence vector graph in continuous space language mode. It is also clarified that the newly established feature extraction method does not require linguistic means but significantly enhances the effectiveness of translation quality evaluation. © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159010640&amp;doi=10.1109%2fECEI57668.2023.10105339&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=77dd374c70859b33c491ece950dcd60c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cobey, K.D.</author><author>Fehlmann, C.A.</author><author>Franco, M.C.</author><author>Ayala, A.P.</author><author>Sikora, L.</author><author>Rice, D.B.</author><author>Xu, C.</author><author>Ioannidis, J.P.A.</author><author>Lalu, M.M.</author><author>Ménard, A.</author><author>Neitzel, A.</author><author>Nguyen, B.</author><author>Tsertsvadze, N.</author><author>Moher, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological characteristics and prevalence rates of research reproducibility across disciplines: A scoping review of articles published in 2018-2019</title><secondary-title>eLife</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>eLife</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.7554/eLife.78518</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Reproducibility is a central tenant of research. We aimed to synthesize the literature on reproducibility and describe its epidemiological characteristics, including how reproducibility is defined and assessed. We also aimed to determine and compare estimates for reproducibility across different fields. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to identify English language replication studies published between 2018 and 2019 in economics, education, psychology, health sciences, and biomedicine. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature – CINAHL, Education Source via EBSCOHost, ERIC, Econ-Papers, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), and EconLit. Documents retrieved were screened in duplicate against our inclusion criteria. We extracted year of publication, number of authors, country of affiliation of the corresponding author, and whether the study was funded. For the individual replication studies, we recorded whether a registered protocol for the replication study was used, whether there was contact between the reproducing team and the original authors, what study design was used, and what the primary outcome was. Finally, we recorded how reproducibilty was defined by the authors, and whether the assessed study(ies) successfully reproduced based on this definition. Extraction was done by a single reviewer and quality controlled by a second reviewer. Results: Our search identified 11,224 unique documents, of which 47 were included in this review. Most studies were related to either psychology (48.6%) or health sciences (23.7%). Among these 47 documents, 36 described a single reproducibility study while the remaining 11 reported at least two reproducibility studies in the same paper. Less than the half of the studies referred to a registered protocol. There was variability in the definitions of reproduciblity success. In total, across the 47 documents 177 studies were reported. Based on the definition used by the author of each study, 95 of 177 (53.7%) studies reproduced. Conclusions: This study gives an overview of research across five disciplines that explicitly set out to reproduce previous research. Such reproducibility studies are extremely scarce, the definition of a successfully reproduced study is ambiguous, and the reproducibility rate is overall modest. © Cobey et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164245744&amp;doi=10.7554%2feLife.78518&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8b9de8d7c5e0be04812e956f04846e50</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aviles-Rosa, E.O.</author><author>Medrano, A.C.</author><author>Cantu, A.</author><author>Prada-Tiedemann, P.A.</author><author>Maughan, M.N.</author><author>Gadberry, J.D.</author><author>Greubel, R.R.</author><author>Hall, N.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development of an automated human scent olfactometer and its use to evaluate detection dog perception of human scent</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>19</volume><number>3 March</number><issue>3 March</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0299148</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Working Dogs have shown an extraordinary ability to utilize olfaction for victim recovery efforts. Although instrumental analysis has chemically characterized odor volatiles from various human biospecimens, it remains unclear what perceptually constitutes human scent (HS) for dogs. This may be in part due to the lack of methodology and equipment to train and evaluate HS perception. The aims of this research were 1) to develop an automated human scent olfactometer (AHSO) to present HS to dogs in a controlled setting and 2) use the AHSO to evaluate dogs’ response to different scented articles and individual components of HS. A human volunteer was placed in a clear acrylic chamber and using a vacuum pump and computer-controlled valves, the headspace of this chamber was carried to one of three ports in a different room. Dogs were trained to search all three ports of the olfactometer and alert to the one containing HS. In Experiment 1 and 2, the AHSO was validated by testing two dogs naïve to HS (Experiment 1) and five certified Search and Rescue (SAR) teams naïve to the apparatus (Experiment 2). All dogs showed sensitivity and specificity to HS &gt; 95% in the apparatus. In Experiment 3, we used a spontaneous generalization paradigm to evaluate generalization from the HS chamber to different scented articles exposed to the same volunteer and to a breath sample. Dogs’ response rate to the different scented articles was &lt; 10% but exceeded 40% for the breath sample. In Experiment 4, we replicated this result by re-testing spontaneous generalization to breath and when the volunteer had breath exhausted/removed from the chamber. Dogs’ response rate to breath alone was 88% and only 50% when breath was removed. Altogether, the data indicate that exhaled breath is an important and salient component of HS under these conditions. © 2024 Public Library of Science.

Replications are the strongest source of evidence to verify research findings and knowledge claims. In the social sciences, replication studies often fail and thus a continuing need for replication studies to confirm tentative facts, expand knowledge to gain new understanding, and verify hypotheses. Failure to replicate in the social and behavioral sciences sometimes arises due to dissimilarity between hypotheses formulated in original and replication studies. Alternatively, failure to replicate also occurs when the same hypothesis is tested; but done so in the absence of knowledge from previous investigations, as when original study effect sizes are not considered in replication studies. To increase replicability of research findings, this paper demonstrates that the application of two one-sided tests to evaluate a replication question provides a superior means for conducting replications, assuming all other methodological procedures remained as similar as possible. Furthermore, this paper sought to explore the impact of heteroscedasticity and unbalanced designs in replication studies in four paired conditions of variance and sample size. Two Monte Carlo simulations, each with two stages, were conducted to investigate conclusion consistency among different replication procedures to determine the repeatability of an observed effect. Overall, the proposed approach yielded a higher proportion of successful replications than the conventional approach (testing the original null hypothesis of no effect). Thus, findings can be confirmed by replications and in the absence of confirmation, there cannot be a final statement about any theory. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152962869&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs11135-023-01657-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ee62ea5b0538d93afa1c0c3048a0a42d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Stekelenborg, J.</author><author>Kara, V.</author><author>Haack, R.</author><author>Vogel, U.</author><author>Garg, A.</author><author>Krupp, M.</author><author>Gofman, K.</author><author>Dreyfus, B.</author><author>Hauben, M.</author><author>Bate, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Individual Case Safety Report Replication: An Analysis of Case Reporting Transmission Networks</title><secondary-title>Drug Safety</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Drug Safety</full-title></periodical><pages>39-52</pages><volume>46</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s40264-022-01251-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction: The basis of pharmacovigilance is provided by the exchange of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) between the recipient of the original report and other interested parties, which include Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Health Authorities (HAs). Different regulators have different reporting requirements for report transmission. This results in replication of each ICSR that will exist in multiple locations. Adding in the fact that each case will go through multiple versions, different recipients may receive different case versions at different times, potentially influencing patient safety decisions and potentially amplifying or obscuring safety signals inappropriately. Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the magnitude of replication, the variability among recipients, and the subsequent divergence across recipients of ICSRs. Methods: Seven participating TransCelerate Member Companies (MCs) queried their respective safety databases covering a 3-year period and provided aggregate ICSR submission statistics for expedited safety reports to an independent project manager. As measured in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), ICSR volume for these seven MCs makes up approximately 20% of the total case volume. Aggregate metrics were calculated from the company data, specifically: (i) number of ICSR transmissions, (ii) average number of recipients (ANR) per case version transmitted, (iii) a submission selectivity metric, which measures the percentage of recipients not having received all sequential case version numbers, and (iv) percent of common ISCRs residing in two or more MAH databases. Results: The analysis reflects 2,539,802 case versions, distributed through 7,602,678 submissions. The overall mean replication rate is 3.0 submissions per case version. The distribution of the ANR replication measure was observed to be very long-tailed, with a significant fraction of case versions (~ 12.4% of all transmissions) being sent to ten or more HA recipients. Replication is higher than average for serious, unlisted, and literature cases, ranging from 3.5 to 6.1 submissions per version. Within the subset of ICSR versions sent to three recipients, a significant degree of variability in the actual recipients (i.e., HAs) was observed, indicating that there is not one single combination of the same three HAs predominantly receiving an ICSR. Submission selectivity increases with the case version. For case version 6, the range of the submission selectivity for the MAHs ranges from ~ 10% to over 50%, with a median of 30.2%. Within the participating MAHs, the percentage of cases that reside within at least two safety databases is approximately 2% across five databases. Further analysis of the data from three MAHs showed percentages of 13.4%, 15.6%, and 27.9% of ICSRs originating from HAs and any other partners such as other MAHs and other institutions. Conclusion: Replication of ICSRs and the variation of available safety information in recipient databases were quantified and shown to be substantial. Our work shows that multiple processors and medical reviewers will likely handle the same original ICSR as a result of replication. Aside from the obvious duplicate work, this phenomenon could conceivably lead to differing clinical assessments and decisions. If replication could be reduced or even eliminated, this would enable more focus on activities with a benefit for patient safety. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144861472&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs40264-022-01251-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=93e98f4dff0df098633121440b402662</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anderson, L.</author><author>Presnetsova, L.</author><author>Wahl, D.B.</author><author>Phelps, G.</author><author>Gous, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing reproducibility in sedimentary macroscopic charcoal count data</title><secondary-title>Quaternary Research (United States)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quaternary Research (United States)</full-title></periodical><pages>177-196</pages><volume>111</volume><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/qua.2022.43</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Current understanding of global late Quaternary fire history is largely drawn from sedimentary charcoal data. Since publication, CharAnalysis increasingly has been relied upon as a robust method for analyzing these data. However, several underlying assumptions of the algorithm have not been tested. This study uses replicated charcoal count data to examine the assumption of Poisson distribution and reproducibility of peak detection. Results show &lt;10% of the replicate counts are Poisson distributed, a maximum peak replication rate of 60%, and, for &gt;90% of the data, intra-level count differences were larger than the threshold used to identify significance in inter-level differences. A pronounced edge effect was observed at the beginning and end of the records, cautioning against validation of results based on sections corresponding to the historical period. The proximal cause for low reproducibility is likely a lack of spatial randomness of charcoal particles at the scale of a core diameter. Until and unless decomposition methods can be developed that accommodate the observed limitations inherent in particle count data, best practices for interpreting charcoal records may be to rely on qualitative interpretations based on smoothed influx values and minimum particle count values in the hundreds.

This large variability poses a major challenge for learning-based speech enhancement systems, since a mismatch between the training and testing conditions can substantially reduce the performance of the system. Generalization to unseen conditions is typically assessed by testing the system with a new speech, noise or binaural room impulse response (BRIR) database different from the one used during training. However, the difficulty of the speech enhancement task can change across databases, which can substantially influence the results. The present study introduces a generalization assessment framework that uses a reference model trained on the test condition, such that it can be used as a proxy for the difficulty of the test condition. This allows to disentangle the effect of the change in task difficulty from the effect of dealing with new data, and thus to define a new measure of generalization performance termed the generalization gap. The procedure is repeated in a cross-validation fashion by cycling through multiple speech, noise, and BRIR databases to accurately estimate the generalization gap. The proposed framework is applied to evaluate the generalization potential of a feedforward neural network (FFNN), Conv-TasNet, DCCRN and MANNER. We find that for all models, the performance degrades the most in speech mismatches, while good noise and room generalization can be achieved by training on multiple databases. Moreover, while recent models show higher performance in matched conditions, their performance substantially decreases in mismatched conditions and can become inferior to that of the FFNN-based system.  © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173394588&amp;doi=10.1109%2fTASLP.2023.3318965&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9c386fe5c3000c52dd18d5354ac7833d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ren, Q.</author><author>Guo, X.</author><author>Yang, D.</author><author>Zhao, C.</author><author>Zhang, X.</author><author>Xia, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A wide survey of heavy metals-induced in-vitro DNA replication stress characterized by rate-limited replication</title><secondary-title>Current Research in Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Research in Toxicology</full-title></periodical><volume>6</volume><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.crtox.2024.100152</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Heavy metals (HMs) are environmental pollutants that pose a threat to human health and have been accepted to cause various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. DNA replication stress has been identified to be associated with such diseases. However, the effect of HMs exclusively on DNA replication stress is still not well understood. In this study, DNA replication stress induced by thirteen HMs was assessed using a simplified in-vitro DNA replication model. Two parameters, Cte/Ctc reflecting the cycle threshold value alteration and Ke/Kc reflecting the linear phase slope change, were calculated based on the DNA replication amplification curve to evaluate the rate of exponential and linear phases. These parameters were used to detect the replication rate reflecting in-vitro DNA replication stress induced by tested HMs. According to the effective concentrations and rate-limiting degree, HMs were ranked as follows: Hg, Ce &gt; Pb &gt; Zn &gt; Cr &gt; Cd &gt; Co &gt; Fe &gt; Mn, Cu, Bi, Sr, Ni. Additionally, EDTA could relieve the DNA replication stress induced by some HMs. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential danger of HMs themselves on DNA replication and provides new insight into the possible links between HMs and DNA replication-related diseases. © 2024 The Author(s)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183996800&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.crtox.2024.100152&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=81e746d77742ba2ec56d5c21a9ae658c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Z.</author><author>Lei, Y.</author><author>Kabán, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimization and Learning With Randomly Compressed Gradient Updates</title><secondary-title>Neural Computation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neural Computation</full-title></periodical><pages>1234-1287</pages><volume>35</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1162/neco_a_01588</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Gradient descent methods are simple and efficient optimization algorithms with widespread applications.

Then we extend our analysis to two variants of SGD: batch and mini-batch gradient descent. Furthermore, we show that these variants achieve almost optimal rates compared to their high-dimensional gradient setting. Thus, our results provide a way to reduce the dimension of gradient updates without affecting the convergence rate in the generalization analysis.

Gram-negative bacteria like Salmonella employ various strategies, such as altering membrane properties, to resist treatment. Their two-membrane structure affects susceptibility to antibiotics, whereas specific proteins and the peptidoglycan layer maintain envelope integrity. Disruptions can compromise stability and resistance profile toward xenobiotics. In this study, we investigated the unexplored protein SanA’s role in modifying bacterial membranes, impacting antibiotic resistance, and intracellular replication within host cells. Methods: We generated a sanA deletion mutant and complemented it in trans to assess its biological function. High-throughput phenotypic profiling with Biolog Phenotype microarrays was conducted using 240 xenobiotics. Membrane properties and permeability were analyzed via cytochrome c binding, hexadecane adhesion, nile red, and ethidium bromide uptake assays, respectively. For intracellular replication analysis, primary bone marrow macrophages served as a host cells model. Results: Our findings demonstrated that the absence of sanA increased membrane permeability, hydrophilicity, and positive charge, resulting in enhanced resistance to certain antibiotics that target peptidoglycan synthesis. Furthermore, the sanA deletion mutant demonstrated enhanced replication rates within primary macrophages, highlighting its ability to evade the bactericidal effects of the immune system. Taking together, we provide valuable insights into a poorly known SanA protein, highlighting the complex interplay among bacterial genetics, membrane physiology, and antibiotic resistance, underscoring its significance in understanding Salmonella pathogenicity.

Here, we used the hypothesis-neutral approach of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to gain comprehensive understanding of the effects of a course of electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), the animal model equivalent of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), on rat hippocampal miRNAs. Significant differential expression (p &lt; 0.001) of six hippocampal miRNAs was noted following NGS, after correcting for multiple comparisons. Three of these miRNAs were upregulated (miR-132, miR-212, miR-331) and three downregulated (miR-204, miR-483, miR-301a). qRT-PCR confirmed significant changes in four of the six miRNAs (miR-132, miR-212, miR-204, miR-483). miR-483 was also significantly reduced in frontal cortex, though no other significant alterations were noted in frontal cortex, cerebellum, or whole blood. Assessing the translatability of the results, miR-132 and miR-483 were significantly reduced in whole blood samples from medicated patients with depression (n = 50) compared to healthy controls (n = 45), though ECT had no impact on miRNA levels. Notably, pre-ECT miR-204 levels moderately positively correlated with depression severity at baseline and moderately negatively correlated with mood score reduction post-ECT. miRNAs were also examined in cerebrospinal fluid and serum from a separate cohort of patients (n = 8) treated with ECT; no significant changes were noted post-treatment. However, there was a large positive correlation between changes in miR-212 and mood score post-ECT in serum. Though replication studies using larger sample sizes are required, alterations in miRNA expression may be informative about the mechanism of action of ECS/ECT and in turn might give insight into the neurobiology of depression. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142278513&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs12035-022-03131-8&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b54619629dcbce4eeb7564c4fe8a598f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cubillos, G.</author><author>Monckeberg, M.</author><author>Plaza, A.</author><author>Morgan, M.</author><author>Estevez, P.A.</author><author>Choolani, M.</author><author>Kemp, M.W.</author><author>Illanes, S.E.</author><author>Perez, C.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development of machine learning models to predict gestational diabetes risk in the first half of pregnancy</title><secondary-title>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</full-title></periodical><volume>23</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12884-023-05766-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Early prediction of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) risk is of particular importance as it may enable more efficacious interventions and reduce cumulative injury to mother and fetus. The aim of this study is to develop machine learning (ML) models, for the early prediction of GDM using widely available variables, facilitating early intervention, and making possible to apply the prediction models in places where there is no access to more complex examinations. Methods: The dataset used in this study includes registries from 1,611 pregnancies. Twelve different ML models and their hyperparameters were optimized to achieve early and high prediction performance of GDM. A data augmentation method was used in training to improve prediction results. Three methods were used to select the most relevant variables for GDM prediction. After training, the models ranked with the highest Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUCROC), were assessed on the validation set. Models with the best results were assessed in the test set as a measure of generalization performance. Results: Our method allows identifying many possible models for various levels of sensitivity and specificity. Four models achieved a high sensitivity of 0.82, a specificity in the range 0.72–0.74, accuracy between 0.73–0.75, and AUCROC of 0.81. These models required between 7 and 12 input variables. Another possible choice could be a model with sensitivity of 0.89 that requires just 5 variables reaching an accuracy of 0.65, a specificity of 0.62, and AUCROC of 0.82. Conclusions: The principal findings of our study are: Early prediction of GDM within early stages of pregnancy using regular examinations/exams; the development and optimization of twelve different ML models and their hyperparameters to achieve the highest prediction performance; a novel data augmentation method is proposed to allow reaching excellent GDM prediction results with various models. © 2023, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162762606&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12884-023-05766-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=464db2b32493ff8f1f4e9ed1242670cf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clift, G.</author><author>Beaudry, J.</author><author>Leung, S.</author><author>Kaufman, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Verification report: Egalitarianism in young children</title><secondary-title>Infant and Child Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infant and Child Development</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/icd.2505</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The present study sought to evaluate the reproducibility of prominent findings stated by Fehr et al. in their developmental resource allocation experiment "Egalitarianism in Young Children", published in 2008. The experiment involved children making decisions about distributing sweets between themselves and either an in-group or an out-group recipient. Fehr et al. found that (1) inequity aversion develops with age; (2) 3- to 4-year-old children are inclined toward self-advantageous allocations, whereas 7- to 8-year-olds distribute sweets more evenly in divisions, and (3) the influence of group status increases as children age. The original article stated that 229 Swiss school students aged 3 to 8 years (102 boys, 127 girls) participated in the study. However, no further demographics were reported. In our attempts to reproduce Fehr et al.'s original analyses and reanalyse the raw dataset, we found that one of the key variables was miscoded. After rectifying the miscoded variable, the reproduction results revealed only one ambiguously irreproducible result regarding a group status main effect in the sharing mini-game—with three other tests exhibiting either strong reproducibility or ambiguous reproducibility. Reanalysis results indicated that Fehr et al.'s conclusions are robust when tested with alternative analytical tests. Highlights: We evaluated the reproducibility of Fehr et al.'s (2008) highly cited developmental resource allocation findings. After identifying an inversely coded variable, we found all tests—bar one probit regression not related to major findings—to be reproducible. Reanalysis confirmed the robustness of Fehr et al.'s conclusions when using alternate analytical methods. Fehr et al.'s developmental resource allocation findings are reproducible and have theoretical implications for understanding inequity aversion and group status effects on resource allocation decisions in young children. © 2024 The Authors.

This topic has attracted wide attention in the strategy field. Accordingly, our study replicates a highly influential study, 'Managerial ties and firm performance in a transition economy: The nature of a micro-macro link' (Peng &amp; Luo, 2000). The original study found that managerial political ties greatly improve organizational performance, and that this 'micro-macro' link varies across ownership types, business sectors, firm sizes, and industry growth rates. This replication study offers a hierarchical view of political ties by extending it from the individual to the organizational level and explores the complex link between the two levels of corporate political ties and firm performance. The results of a staged quasi-replication exercise show some similarities with the original study in the mechanism of corporate political ties on firm performance but, more importantly, reveal some key differences in the effect size and contingent effects. Furthermore, an extended test shows that corporate political ties are multilevel, and different levels of political ties vary in their mechanisms and effects on firm performance. The findings reveal temporal and contextual sensitivities of political ties studies in transition economies.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Specifically, it has been proposed that depressed individuals believe that negative events are more informative than positive events, resulting in higher learning rates from negative outcomes (Pulcu and Browning, 2019). In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as commonly used in depression treatment trials, might change learning rates for affective outcomes. Healthy adults completed an established reinforcement learning task (Pulcu and Browning, 2017) in which the information content of reward and loss outcomes was manipulated by varying the volatility of stimulus-outcome associations. Learning rates on the tasks were quantified using computational models. Stimulation over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) but not motor cortex (M1) increased learning rates specifically for reward outcomes. The effects of prefrontal tDCS were cognitive state-dependent: tDCS applied during task performance increased learning rates for wins; tDCS applied before task performance decreased both win and loss learning rates. A replication study confirmed the key finding that tDCS to DLPFC during task performance increased learning rates specifically for rewards. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential of tDCS for modulating computational parameters of reinforcement learning that are relevant to mood disorders. © 2023</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150477391&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.neuroimage.2023.120029&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=93cf39bdb43608cef1653806256e4bb7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meehan, Z.M.</author><author>Shaffer, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Do Longer Exhalations Increase HRV During Slow-Paced Breathing?</title><secondary-title>Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10484-024-09637-2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Slow-paced breathing at an individual’s resonance frequency (RF) is a common element of heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback training (Laborde et al. in Psychophysiology 59:e13952, 2022). Although there is strong empirical support for teaching clients to slow their respiration rate (RR) to the adult RF range between 4.5 and 6.5 bpm (Lehrer &amp; Gevirtz, 2014), there have been no definitive findings regarding the best inhalation-to-exhalation (IE) ratio to increase HRV when breathing within this range. Three methodological challenges have frustrated previous studies: ensuring participants breathed at the target RR, IE ratio, and the same RR during each IE ratio. The reviewed studies disagreed regarding the effect of IE ratios. Three studies found no IE ratio effect (Cappo &amp; Holmes in J Psychosom Res 28:265-273, 1984; Edmonds et al. in Biofeedback 37:141-146, 2009; Klintworth et al. in Physiol Meas 33:1717-1731, 2012). One reported an advantage for equal inhalations and exhalations (Lin et al. in Int J Psychophysiol 91:206?211, 2014). Four studies observed an advantage for longer exhalations than inhalations (Bae et al. in Psychophysiology 58:e13905, 2021; Laborde et al. in Sustainability 13:7775, 2021; Strauss-Blasche et al. in Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol 27:601?60, 2000; Van Diest et al. in Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback 39:171?180, 2014). One study reported an advantage for longer inhalations than exhalations (Paprika et al. in Acta Physiol Hung 101:273?281, 2014). We conducted original (N = 26) and replication (N = 16) studies to determine whether a 1:2 IE ratio produces different HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, or nonlinear metrics than a 1:1 ratio when breathing at 6 bpm. Our original study found that IE ratio did not affect HRV time- and frequency-domain metrics. The replication study confirmed these results and found no effect on HRV nonlinear measurements. © The Author(s) 2024.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188168239&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10484-024-09637-2&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9a1a250f373457757863c3553fed6bd7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rost, M.</author><author>Sonnenschein, I.</author><author>Möller, S.</author><author>Lembens, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Don't we know enough about models?

The assessment of students' understanding is a prerequisite for improving teaching practices, particularly in addressing the persistently high drop-out rates observed in chemistry and chemistry-related programs. Employing a quantitative methodology, a sample of 181 undergraduate chemistry students was surveyed. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling, resulting in two statistical models that demonstrated an excellent fit to the data, although no empirical preference could be established for one model over the other. Based on the investigation, framing models as exact replicas of the natural world cannot be considered an empirically meaningful dimension of understanding models in science. Additionally, the reliabilities of the latent constructs were found to be insufficiently low to establish generalizable measurements. These findings are discussed with a focus on epistemology and advocate for a stronger integration of model theory in chemistry teaching and learning. Finally, the importance of establishing a stronger connection between empirical evidence and the implementation of curricular changes in higher education is emphasized. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2023.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171802416&amp;doi=10.1515%2fcti-2022-0032&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=95ee5f5be32ae3f3304adb886fa7e55c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Collette-Robert, S.</author><author>Guerville, F.</author><author>Novais, T.</author><author>Pongan, E.</author><author>Morelon, E.</author><author>Vernaudon, J.</author><author>Francq, E.</author><author>Couzi, L.</author><author>Bourdel-Marchasson, I.</author><author>Caillard, S.</author><author>Pszczolinski, R.</author><author>Heitz, D.</author><author>Gilbert, T.</author><author>Garnier-Crussard, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intrinsic capacity and frailty in older adults with end-stage kidney disease undergoing pre-kidney transplant comprehensive geriatric assessment</title><secondary-title>Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging</full-title></periodical><volume>28</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jnha.2024.100236</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: Frailty has been extensively studied in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and kidney transplant (KT) patients. The identification of frailty is useful to predict adverse outcomes among ESKD and KT patients. The recent concept of intrinsic capacity (IC) appears as a good and easy-to-understand tool to screen for and monitor frailty in older adults with ESKD. This study aims to assess the relationships between frailty and IC in older adults with ESKD awaiting KT. Design: Cross-sectional study Setting and participants: 236 patients from a day-care geriatric unit undergoing pre-KT geriatric assessment between 2017 and 2022 were included in the main sample, and 151 patients in an independent multicentric replication sample. Measurements: Frailty was evaluated using the physical frailty phenotype (PFP) and IC measures using the World Health Organization's screening (step 1) and diagnostic (step 2) tools for five IC domains (vitality, locomotion, audition, cognition, psychology). Multivariate regressions were run to assess relationships between PFP and IC domains, adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. Analyses were replicated using another independent multicenter cohort including 151 patients with ESKD to confirm the results. Results: Impairments in the locomotion, psychology, and vitality IC domains according to WHO screening tools were associated with frailty (odds ratio 9.62 [95% CI 4.09−24.99], 3.19 [95% CI 1.11–8.88], and 3.11 [95% CI 1.32–7.29], respectively). When IC were measured linearly with z-scores, all IC domains except hearing were inversely associated with frailty. In the replication cohort, results were overall similar, with a greater association between psychology domain and frailty. Conclusion: This study highlights the relationship between frailty and IC in ESKD patients. We assume that IC may be assessed and monitored in ESKD patients, to predict and prevent future frailty, and post-KT adverse outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190739625&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jnha.2024.100236&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fe93d398c8ce1fad5853ed7740651f17</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arvan, M.</author><author>Parde, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human Evaluation Reproduction Report for Data-to-text Generation with Macro Planning</title><secondary-title>HumEval 2023 - Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems, associated with the 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing 2023, RANLP 2023</secondary-title></titles><pages>89-96</pages><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.26615/978-954-452-088-5_008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper presents a partial reproduction study of Data-to-text Generation with Macro Planning by Puduppully and Lapata (2021).

Addressing the requisites of cattle behavior classification in the agricultural sector, this paper presents a novel cattle behavior classification network tailored for intricate environments. This network amalgamates the capabilities of CNN and Bi-LSTM. Initially, a data collection method is devised within an authentic farm setting, followed by the delineation of eight fundamental cattle behaviors. The foundational step involves utilizing VGG16 as the cornerstone of the CNN network, thereby extracting spatial feature vectors from each video data sequence. Subsequently, these features are channeled into a Bi-LSTM classification model, adept at unearthing semantic insights from temporal data in both directions. This process ensures precise recognition and categorization of cattle behaviors. To validate the model’s efficacy, ablation experiments, generalization effect assessments, and comparative analyses under consistent experimental conditions are performed. These investigations, involving module replacements within the classification model and comprehensive analysis of ablation experiments, affirm the model’s effectiveness. The self-constructed dataset about cattle is subjected to evaluation using cross-entropy loss, assessing the model’s generalization efficacy across diverse subjects and viewing perspectives. Classification performance accuracy is quantified through the application of a confusion matrix. Furthermore, a set of comparison experiments is conducted, involving three pertinent deep learning models: MASK-RCNN, CNN-LSTM, and EfficientNet-LSTM. The outcomes of these experiments unequivocally substantiate the superiority of the proposed model. Empirical results underscore the CNN-Bi-LSTM model’s commendable performance metrics: achieving 94.3% accuracy, 94.2% precision, and 93.4% recall while navigating challenges such as varying light conditions, occlusions, and environmental influences. The objective of this study is to employ a fusion of CNN and Bi-LSTM to autonomously extract features from multimodal data, thereby addressing the challenge of classifying cattle behaviors within intricate scenes. By surpassing the constraints imposed by conventional methodologies and the analysis of single-sensor data, this approach seeks to enhance the precision and generalizability of cattle behavior classification. The consequential practical, economic, and societal implications for the agricultural sector are of considerable significance. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172727142&amp;doi=10.3390%2fs23187714&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8a9f19aa17214f29b7afd61bf91fa092</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Belz, A.</author><author>Thomson, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 2023 ReproNLP Shared Task on Reproducibility of Evaluations in NLP: Overview and Results</title><secondary-title>HumEval 2023 - Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems, associated with the 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing 2023, RANLP 2023</secondary-title></titles><pages>35-48</pages><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.26615/978-954-452-088-5_004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper presents an overview of, and the results from, the 2023 Shared Task on Reproducibility of Evaluations in NLP (ReproNLP’23), following on from two previous shared tasks on reproducibility of evaluations in NLG, ReproGen’21 and ReproGen’22.

Such self-supervised methods require high-quality salient features and consequently suffer from severe performance drop for indoor scenes, where low-textured regions dominant in the scenes are almost indiscriminative. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised indoor monocular depth estimation framework called F2Depth. A self-supervised optical flow estimation network is introduced to supervise depth learning. To improve optical flow estimation performance in low-textured areas, only some patches of points with more discriminative features are adopted for finetuning based on our well-designed patch-based photometric loss. The finetuned optical flow estimation network generates high-accuracy optical flow as a supervisory signal for depth estimation. Correspondingly, an optical flow consistency loss is designed. Multi-scale feature maps produced by finetuned optical flow estimation network perform warping to compute feature map synthesis loss as another supervisory signal for depth learning. Experimental results on the NYU Depth V2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and our proposed losses. To evaluate the generalization ability of our F2Depth, we collect a Campus Indoor depth dataset composed of approximately 1500 points selected from 99 images in 18 scenes. Zero-shot generalization experiments on 7-Scenes dataset and Campus Indoor achieve δ1 accuracy of 75.8% and 76.0% respectively. The accuracy results show that our model can generalize well to monocular images captured in unknown indoor scenes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189864761&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2024.108391&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6ef7e6be950ea911bf0e979051c0578e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abbate, I.</author><author>Rozera, G.</author><author>Cimini, E.</author><author>Carletti, F.</author><author>Tartaglia, E.</author><author>Rubino, M.</author><author>Pittalis, S.</author><author>Esvan, R.</author><author>Gagliardini, R.</author><author>Mondi, A.</author><author>Mazzotta, V.</author><author>Camici, M.</author><author>Girardi, E.</author><author>Vaia, F.</author><author>Puro, V.</author><author>Antinori, A.</author><author>Maggi, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Kinetics of TTV Loads in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Early Treated Acute HIV Infections</title><secondary-title>Viruses</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Viruses</full-title></periodical><volume>15</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/v15091931</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Torquetenovirus (TTV) is the most abundant component of the human blood virome and its replication is controlled by a functioning immune system. In this study, TTV replication was evaluated in 21 people with acute HIV infection (AHI) and immune reconstitution following antiretroviral therapy (ART). PBMC-associated TTV and HIV-1 DNA, as well as plasma HIV-1 RNA, were measured by real-time PCR. CD4 and CD8 differentiation, activation, exhaustion, and senescence phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Thirteen healthy donors (HD) and twenty-eight chronically infected HIV individuals (CHI), late presenters at diagnosis, were included as control groups. TTV replication in AHI seems to be controlled by the immune system being higher than in HD and lower than in CHI. During ART, a transient increase in TTV DNA levels was associated with a significant perturbation of activation and senescence markers on CD8 T cells. TTV loads were positively correlated with the expansion of CD8 effector memory and CD57+ cells. Our results shed light on the kinetics of TTV replication in the context of HIV acute infection and confirm that the virus replication is strongly regulated by the modulation of the immune system. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172460853&amp;doi=10.3390%2fv15091931&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d89b832d61985d0a57c3799355ac6168</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manolov, R.</author><author>Tanious, R.</author><author>Fernández-Castilla, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A proposal for the assessment of replication of effects in single-case experimental designs</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</full-title></periodical><pages>997-1024</pages><volume>55</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jaba.923</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In science in general and in the context of single-case experimental designs, replication of the effects of the intervention within and/or across participants or experiments is crucial for establishing causality and for assessing the generality of the intervention effect. Specific developments and proposals for assessing whether an effect has been replicated or not (or to what extent) are scarce, in the general context of behavioral sciences, and practically null in the single-case experimental designs context. We propose an extension of the modified Brinley plot for assessing how many of the effects replicate. To make this assessment possible, a definition of replication is suggested, on the basis of expert judgment, rather than on statistical criteria. The definition of replication and its graphical representation are justified, presenting their strengths and limitations, and illustrated with real data.

He thus concluded that while firearm availability influences how people commit suicide, it does not affect total numbers. However, the study contains numerous logical and methodological issues and is at odds with the evidence base. Therefore, I attempt to reproduce the original results. Method: I reproduce the original study’s methods: ordinary least squares regression, weighted by the square root of the population, with log-transformed suicide rates and three separate firearm availability measures: global estimates from the Small Arms Survey, proportion of suicides committed with firearms, and a European Union survey of firearm ownership. I also test several methodological variations and include U.S. suicide data. Results: In contrast to Kleck, global analyses with Small Arms Survey data found a significant and positive association between firearm availability and total suicides, as did U.S. analyses. Analyses with other firearm availability measures comported with the original study, finding no association. Conclusion: The main result in Kleck failed to reproduce, finding instead a significant association between firearm availability and suicide rates, as did U.S. analyses. While reproductions of Kleck’s other analyses continued to show no association, they were based on unreliable methods. I therefore reject Kleck’s conclusion that that firearm availability does not influence suicide rates. Highlights Using data global data, I find firearm availability is positively associated with suicide rates. I identify serious flaws in the logic and methods of Kleck and an earlier review.

We investigated the impact of the invasion of the European bumble bee Bombus terrestris in NW Patagonia, Argentina, on the pollination mutualism between the native legume Vicia nigricans and its main pollinator, the native bumble bee B. dahlbomii, and its consequences on plant reproduction. We assessed visitation frequency by both bumble bees and reproductive output of V. nigricans across space (in 12 sites) and time (over five seasons, from 1999 to 2012), before and after invasion in 2006. In 2012, we studied the behavior, visitation frequency, and nectar consumption by both bumble bees, the nectar consumed, the quantity and quality of pollen deposited and the reproductive output of V. nigricans in a subset of five sites across a gradient of B. terrestris invasion. Six years after invasion, B. terrestris became the most frequent visitor and nectar robber of V. nigricans flowers, while visits by B. dahlbomii dropped by 50%, fruit set by 43% and seeds per fruit by 32%. This detrimental effect on plant reproduction resulted from the high frequency of nectar robbing by B. terrestris, the nectar depletion, and the concomitant reduction of legitimate visits by the native bumble bee, which in turn lead to a decreased deposition of high quality pollen. Our study demonstrates that biological invasions can alter ecological interactions by replacing a plant-pollinator mutualism by a plant-nectar robber antagonism, hence disrupting plant reproduction and undermining long-term population viability. This conclusion raises the urgent need to regulate the international trade of non-native pollinators. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123125297&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10530-022-02729-2&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fbea9dede618985f37d02c702dfb5804</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McManus, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ARE REPLICATION STUDIES INFREQUENT because of NEGATIVE ATTITUDES?: INSIGHTS from A SURVEY of ATTITUDES and PRACTICES in SECOND LANGUAGE RESEARCH</title><secondary-title>Studies in Second Language Acquisition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studies in Second Language Acquisition</full-title></periodical><pages>1410-1423</pages><volume>44</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0272263121000838</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replication is a research methodology designed to verify, consolidate, and generalize knowledge and understanding within empirical fields of study. In second language studies, however, reviews share widespread concern about the infrequency of replication. A common but speculative explanation for this situation is that replication studies are not valued because they lack originality and/or innovation. To better understand and respond to the infrequency of replication in our field, 354 researchers were surveyed about their attitudes toward replication and their practices conducting replication studies. Responses included worldwide participation from researchers with and without replication experience. Overall, replications were evaluated as relevant and valuable to the field. Claims that replication studies lack originality/innovation were not supported. However, dissemination issues were identified: half of published replication studies lacked explicit labeling and one quarter of completed replications were unpublished. Explicit labeling of replication studies and training in research methodology and dissemination can address this situation.  © The Author(s), 2021.

QRA produces a single score estimating the degree of reproducibility of a given system and evaluation measure, on the basis of the scores from, and differences between, different reproductions. We test QRA on 18 system and evaluation measure combinations (involving diverse NLP tasks and types of evaluation), for each of which we have the original results and one to seven reproduction results. The proposed QRA method produces degree-of-reproducibility scores that are comparable across multiple reproductions not only of the same, but of different original studies. We find that the proposed method facilitates insights into causes of variation between reproductions, and allows conclusions to be drawn about what changes to system and/or evaluation design might lead to improved reproducibility. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143199125&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fa75895cc753c14552b75a9dff586a5b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vijayakumar, R.</author><author>Cheung, M.W.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing Replicability of Machine Learning Results: An Introduction to Methods on Predictive Accuracy in Social Sciences</title><secondary-title>Social Science Computer Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Social Science Computer Review</full-title></periodical><pages>768-801</pages><volume>39</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0894439319888445</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Machine learning methods have become very popular in diverse fields due to their focus on predictive accuracy, but little work has been conducted on how to assess the replicability of their findings. We introduce and adapt replication methods advocated in psychology to the aims and procedural needs of machine learning research. In Study 1, we illustrate these methods with the use of an empirical data set, assessing the replication success of a predictive accuracy measure, namely, R2 on the cross-validated and test sets of the samples. We introduce three replication aims. First, tests of inconsistency examine whether single replications have successfully rejected the original study. Rejection will be supported if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of R2 difference estimates between replication and original does not contain zero. Second, tests of consistency help support claims of successful replication. We can decide apriori on a region of equivalence, where population values of the difference estimates are considered equivalent for substantive reasons. The 90% CI of a different estimate lying fully within this region supports replication. Third, we show how to combine replications to construct meta-analytic intervals for better precision of predictive accuracy measures. In Study 2, R2 is reduced from the original in a subset of replication studies to examine the ability of the replication procedures to distinguish true replications from nonreplications. We find that when combining studies sampled from same population to form meta-analytic intervals, random-effects methods perform best for cross-validated measures while fixed-effects methods work best for test measures. Among machine learning methods, regression was comparable to many complex methods, while support vector machine performed most reliably across a variety of scenarios. Social scientists who use machine learning to model empirical data can use these methods to enhance the reliability of their findings. © The Author(s) 2019.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077159934&amp;doi=10.1177%2f0894439319888445&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1abfae73362c76c8dbd2bc88a726a880</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sotola, L.K.</author><author>Credé, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the predicted replicability of two decades of experimental research on system justification: A Z-curve analysis</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Social Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Social Psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>895-909</pages><volume>52</volume><number>5-6</number><issue>5-6</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ejsp.2858</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We examine the predicted replicability of experimental research on system justification theory (SJT) by conducting a z-curve analysis. Z-curve is a meta-analytic technique similar to p-curve, but which performs better under conditions of heterogeneity. It estimates the predicted replication rate, average power, false discovery risk, and file drawer ratio (FDR) of a sample of studies. The z-curve based on 116 papers and 232 unique samples suggests that the experimental SJT literature is likely to show low rates of replicability, as indicated by an overall average statistical power of 16%. Moderator analyses suggest that this may be driven in part by publication pressures, that the replicability of research in this area has improved since 2015, and that studies using system threat manipulations show particularly low estimated replication rates (ERR). Implications for the replicability and validity of the experimental SJT literature are discussed, and recommendations to increase the rigor of research are put forth. © 2022 The Authors.

Anxiety symptomatology severity along different dimensions (generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social anxiety, and panic symptoms) was measured using parental and self-reports. Participants completed differential threat acquisition and extinction using an age-appropriate threat conditioning task. They then returned to the lab after 7–10 days to complete an extinction recall task that also assessed threat generalization. Results indicated that more severe overall anxiety was associated with greater cognitive and physiological threat responses during acquisition, extinction, and extinction recall. During acquisition and extinction, all anxiety dimensions manifested greater cognitive threat responses, while panic, separation anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms, but not generalized anxiety, were related to heightened physiological threat responses. In contrast, when we assessed generalization of cognitive threat responses, we found only generalized anxiety symptoms were associated with greater threat response generalization. The study provides preliminary evidence of specificity in threat responses during threat learning across youth with different anxiety symptoms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126614352&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.biopsycho.2022.108314&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1adabf0b3a5a158fd7a94ff536758084</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Akbari, N.</author><author>Asheghi, R.</author><author>Nasirian, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stability and Dynamic of HIV-1 Mathematical Model with Logistic Target Cell Growth, Treatment Rate, Cure Rate and Cell-to-cell Spread</title><secondary-title>Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics</full-title></periodical><pages>411-441</pages><volume>26</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.11650/tjm/211102</electronic-resource-num><abstract>One way of HIV infection spreading is through the cell division of infected cells by mitosis expressed in mathematical models as a logistic process.

The life history and demographic parameters of the four aphid species on their host plants and those of the parasitoid reared on each of the six plant-aphid systems were investigated under controlled environmental conditions (25 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 5% RH and L:D 16:8 h). In terms of the resultant net reproduction rate of the parasitoid, M. persicae reared on Chinese cabbage was the most suitable. However, other life history parameters, such as reproductive period, adult longevity, daily and total fecundity and survivorship, were higher on M. persicae nicotianae on tobacco, which suggests that this system may be the most suitable. These findings will be useful in developing an appropriate production method for mass rearing A. matricariae for augmentative biological control programs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130257737&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10526-022-10146-6&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=411bc7cbe602e3c24002050a19c2daa5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marcano, V.C.</author><author>Susta, L.</author><author>Diel, D.G.</author><author>Cardenas- Garcia, S.</author><author>Miller, P.J.</author><author>Afonso, C.L.</author><author>Brown, C.C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of chickens infected with a recombinant virulent NDV clone expressing chicken IL4</title><secondary-title>Microbial Pathogenesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microbial Pathogenesis</full-title></periodical><volume>159</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.micpath.2021.105116</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: There is evidence that chicken IL4 (chIL4) functions similarly to its mammalian analogue by enhancing type 2 T helper (Th2) humoral immunity and promoting protection against parasitic infections; however, no studies have been performed to assess the effect of chIL4 on the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease (ND). To assess the role of chIL4 in velogenic NDV pathogenesis we created a vNDV infectious clone expressing chIL4. We hypothesized that co-expression of chIL4 during virus replication would result in decreased inflammation caused by the Th1 response and thereby increasing survival to challenge with vNDV. Methods: To evaluate the effect of chIL4 during early infection with velogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in chickens, recombinant NDV clones expressing either chIL4 (rZJ1-IL4) or a control expressing green fluorescent protein (rZJ1-GFP) were created by inserting an expression cassette in an intergenic region of the NDV genome. The pathogenesis of rZJ1-IL4 was assessed in 4-week-old specific pathogen free chickens. The extent of virus replication was evaluated by titration in mucosal secretions and immunohistochemistry in multiple tissues. Expression of chIL4 was confirmed in tissues using immunohistochemistry. Results: Infection of birds with the rZJ1-IL4 resulted in successful viral replication in vivo and in vitro and generation of the chIL4 in tissues. All birds were clinically normal 2 DPI, with one bird in each group showing conjunctival swelling and enlarged spleens grossly. At 5 DPI, moderate or severe depression was observed in birds infected with rZJ1-GFP or rZJ1-IL4, respectively. Neurological signs and thymic atrophy were observed in one bird infected with rZJ1-IL4. Grossly, conjunctival swelling, mottled spleen and proventricular hemorrhages were observed at 5 DPI in one bird from each group. At 5 DPI, severe necrosis in the spleen, bursa and cecal tonsils were observed in birds infected with rZJ1-GFP, along with minimal evidence of chIL4 expression. In contrast, splenic atrophy, and moderate necrosis in the bursa and cecal tonsils were observed in birds infected with rZJ1-IL4. In addition, chIL4 signal was found in all tissues of rZJ1-IL4 birds at 5DPI. Conclusions: The production of chIL4 by a recombinant NDV strain resulted in the activation of the positive feedback loop associated with IL4 production. Insertion of chIL4 into NDV may decrease necrosis to lymphoid organs while increasing the severity of lymphoid atrophy and prolonged disease. However, with a low number of birds it is difficult to determine whether these results are significant to disease outcome. © 2021</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112489766&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.micpath.2021.105116&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3dd24c3e724caa64d4e47e36ebc20301</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Z.</author><author>Wang, L.</author><author>Wang, X.</author><author>Sun, Y.</author><author>Li, H.</author><author>Zhang, Z.</author><author>Ren, C.</author><author>Zhang, X.</author><author>Li, S.</author><author>Lu, J.</author><author>Xu, L.</author><author>Yue, X.</author><author>Hong, Y.</author><author>Li, Q.</author><author>Zhu, H.</author><author>Gong, Y.</author><author>Gao, C.</author><author>Hu, H.</author><author>Gao, L.</author><author>Liang, X.</author><author>Ma, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>cccDNA Surrogate MC-HBV–Based Screen Identifies Cohesin Complex as a Novel HBV Restriction Factor</title><secondary-title>Cellular and Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cellular and Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology</full-title></periodical><pages>1177-1198</pages><volume>14</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcmgh.2022.08.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background &amp; Aims: Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of hepatitis B virus (HBV), existing as a stable minichromosome in the hepatocyte, is responsible for persistent HBV infection. Maintenance and sustained replication of cccDNA require its interaction with both viral and host proteins. However, the cccDNA-interacting host factors that limit HBV replication remain elusive. Methods: Minicircle HBV (MC-HBV), a recombinant cccDNA, was constructed based on chimeric intron and minicircle DNA technology. By mass spectrometry based on pull-down with biotinylated MC-HBV, the cccDNA-hepatocyte interaction profile was mapped. HBV replication was assessed in different cell models that support cccDNA formation. Results: MC-HBV supports persistent HBV replication and mimics the cccDNA minichromosome. The MC-HBV–based screen identified cohesin complex as a cccDNA binding host factor, leading to reduced HBV replication. Mechanistically, with the help of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which has specific binding sites on cccDNA, cohesin loads on cccDNA and reshapes cccDNA confirmation to prevent RNA polymerase II enrichment. Interestingly, HBV X protein transcriptionally reduces structural maintenance of chromosomes complex expression to partially relieve the inhibitory role of the cohesin complex on HBV replication. Conclusions: Our data not only provide a feasible approach to explore cccDNA-binding factors, but also identify cohesin/CTCF complex as a critical host restriction factor for cccDNA-driven HBV replication. These findings provide a novel insight into cccDNA–host interaction and targeted therapeutic intervention for HBV infection. © 2022 The Authors</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139842660&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jcmgh.2022.08.002&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ba83e4a6b16d76fbd51b268f5919d6b1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacEacheron, M.</author><author>Kohut, T.</author><author>Fisher, W.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>No Gender Differences in Enrollment for Replicated, Minimally-Different ‘Pornographic’ Versus ‘Photographic’ Studies</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Sexual Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Sexual Health</full-title></periodical><pages>130-143</pages><volume>34</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/19317611.2021.1944420</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: Since women tend to use pornography less, they may enroll less in studies concerning it and/or those who do may be gender-atypical.

Regardless of its importance, limited research is available on detection dog odor generalization. The objectives of this study were (1) evaluate the use of an intermittent schedule of reinforcement to assess generalization in dogs and (2) evaluate olfactory generalization from a single exemplar of smokeless powder (SP). Dogs (N = 5) were trained to detect SP in an automated olfactometer under an intermittent schedule of reinforcement where only 60% of correct responses were reinforced. After training, eight non-reinforced probe trials were inserted within a session. A total of 15 testing odors were evaluated across 15 consecutive sessions (one odor/session). Six of the testing odors were control and the remaining testing odors were objects indirectly exposed to SP, objects that contained or were directly exposed to SP, single-base SP and diphenylamine (the main volatile present in the headspace of SP). Dogs’ response rate to all testing odors except for the cotton gauzes and t-shirt cloths exposed to the headspace of SP, the simulated IED, and Getxent tubes exposed to direct contact with SP were statistically lower than their response rate of actual SP. The response rate to SP was not different across all 15 testing sessions suggesting that the intermittent schedule of reinforcement, maintained dog motivation and performance. Data show that the outlined method is a good approach to study generalization in detection dogs. These results also highlight dog generalization to SP varieties and associated odors. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133615336&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10071-022-01648-y&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5b2e248170c7e27a95b00bfa718ba70a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mandel, N.</author><author>Sandino, J.</author><author>Galvez-Serna, J.</author><author>Vanegas, F.</author><author>Milford, M.</author><author>Gonzalez, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resolution-adaptive Quadtrees for Semantic Segmentation Mapping in UAV Applications</title><secondary-title>IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><volume>2022-March</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843498</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been employed for multiple tasks in the last decade, including planetary exploration. A common task for UAVs is mapping, with maps most commonly represented in variable-resolution form, such as Octrees or their 2D-counterparts, Quadtrees. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized sensor data processing, but are heavily influenced by the training data and the resolution of the images. In addition, Octree and Quadtree-based map representations typically insert values into the deepest level of the tree, regardless of the position of the UAV and the resulting image resolution. To alleviate both these issues, we propose a novel Quadtree implementation that considers the resolution of the observations when calculating insertion indices. The probabilistic mapping approach considers the tree structure when looking up probabilistic priors to insert generated observations. The system is implemented in ROS and tested in simulation and experiments with vertical, horizontal and mixed motions at different frequencies of observations. The map reproduction is evaluated with the Kullback-Leibler divergence and qualitatively. Increasing the frequency and approaching a target for closer inspection is shown to improve the quality of the map reproduction. Results also indicate that low-frequency, noisy observations can be overcome by increasing the frequency, opening up avenues for further research on mapping CNN observations.

Classical generalization bounds based on tools such as the VC dimension or Rademacher complexity, are so far unsuitable for deep models and it is doubtful that these techniques can yield tight bounds even in the most idealistic settings (Nagarajan &amp; Kolter, 2019). In this work, we instead revisit the concept of leave-one-out (LOO) error to measure the generalization ability of deep models in the so-called kernel regime. While popular in statistics, the LOO error has been largely overlooked in the context of deep learning. By building upon the recently established connection between neural networks and kernel learning, we leverage the closed-form expression for the leave-one-out error, giving us access to an efficient proxy for the test error. We show both theoretically and empirically that the leave-one-out error is capable of capturing various phenomena in generalization theory, such as double descent, random labels or transfer learning. Our work therefore demonstrates that the leave-one-out error provides a tractable way to estimate the generalization ability of deep neural networks in the kernel regime, opening the door to potential, new research directions in the field of generalization. © 2022 ICLR 2022 - 10th International Conference on Learning Representationss.

The diagnosis is made based on reliable positive clinical signs, but clinicians often require additional time- and cost consuming medical tests and examinations. Resting-state functional connectivity (RS FC) showed its potential as an imaging-based adjunctive biomarker to help distinguish patients from healthy controls and could represent a “rule-in” procedure to assist in the diagnostic process. However, the use of RS FC depends on its applicability in a multi-centre setting, which is particularly susceptible to inter-scanner variability. The aim of this study was to test the robustness of a classification approach based on RS FC in a multi-centre setting. Methods: This study aimed to distinguish 86 FND patients from 86 healthy controls acquired in four different centres using a multivariate machine learning approach based on whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity. First, previously published results were replicated in each centre individually (intra-centre cross-validation) and its robustness across inter-scanner variability was assessed by pooling all the data (pooled cross-validation). Second, we evaluated the generalizability of the method by using data from each centre once as a test set, and the data from the remaining centres as a training set (inter-centre cross-validation). Results: FND patients were successfully distinguished from healthy controls in the replication step (accuracy of 74%) as well as in each individual additional centre (accuracies of 73%, 71% and 70%). The pooled cross validation confirmed that the classifier was robust with an accuracy of 72%. The results survived post-hoc adjustment for anxiety, depression, psychotropic medication intake, and symptom severity. The most discriminant features involved the angular- and supramarginal gyri, sensorimotor cortex, cingular- and insular cortex, and hippocampal regions. The inter-centre validation step did not exceed chance level (accuracy below 50%). Conclusions: The results demonstrate the applicability of RS FC to correctly distinguish FND patients from healthy controls in different centres and its robustness against inter-scanner variability. In order to generalize its use across different centres and aim for clinical application, future studies should work towards optimization of acquisition parameters and include neurological and psychiatric control groups presenting with similar symptoms. © 2022 The Author(s)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132827500&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.nicl.2022.103090&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c8004ab1f44019eb0c540cd60a62bb99</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, T.</author><author>Li, H.</author><author>Conley, Y.P.</author><author>Primack, B.A.</author><author>Wang, J.</author><author>Lo, W.-J.</author><author>Li, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Genome-Wide Association Study of Prediabetes Status Change</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Endocrinology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Endocrinology</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fendo.2022.881633</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We conducted the first genome-wide association study of prediabetes status change (to diabetes or normal glycaemia) among 900 White participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis was performed by logistic regression models, controlling for age, gender, body mass index, and the first 3 genetic principal components. Gene-based analysis was conducted by combining SNP-based p values using effective Chi-square test method. Promising SNPs (p &lt; 1×10-5) and genes (p &lt; 1×10-4) were further evaluated for replication among 514 White participants of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). To accommodate familial correlations, generalized estimation equation models were applied for SNP-based analyses in the FHS. Analysis results across ARIC and FHS were combined using inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis method for SNPs and Fisher’s method for genes. We robustly identified 5 novel genes that are associated with prediabetes status change using gene-based analyses, including SGCZ (ARIC p = 9.93×10-6, FHS p = 2.00×10-3, Meta p = 3.72×10-7) at 8p22, HPSE2 (ARIC p = 8.26×10-19, FHS p = 5.85×10-3, Meta p &lt; 8.26×10-19) at 10q24.2, ADGRA1 (ARIC p = 1.34×10-5, FHS p = 1.13×10-3, Meta p = 2.88×10-7) at 10q26.3, GLB1L3 (ARIC p = 3.71×10-6, FHS p = 4.51×10-3, Meta p = 3.16×10-7) at 11q25, and PCSK6 (ARIC p = 6.51×10-6, FHS p = 1.10×10-2, Meta p = 1.25×10-6) at 15q26.3. eQTL analysis indicated that these genes were highly expressed in tissues related to diabetes development. However, we were not able to identify any novel locus in single SNP-based analysis. Future large scale genomic studies of prediabetes status change are warranted.

In animals, the cost of maintaining an effective immune response may reduce the ability to invest in reproduction, resulting in altered susceptibility to disease. However, not all members of a population face identical constraints because differences in an individual's environmental context or physiological state can influence the degree to which traits are negatively associated. Here, we evaluated how variation in timing of breeding, a correlate of fitness, may result in different patterns of trait associations between immunity and reproduction. We measured constitutive immunity in breeding female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) using a bacteria killing assay with blood plasma to assess the relationships between bacteria killing ability (BKA), reproductive effort, and reproductive success. We found that timing of breeding can influence the association between BKA and reproductive effort, but its effects are not homogeneous among all traits. Late-breeding tree swallows with stronger BKA laid smaller clutches, a pattern that was not apparent in early breeders. Regardless of the timing of breeding, birds with stronger BKA fed their nestlings less. Despite a negative association with reproductive effort, we found no association between immunity and reproductive success. We provide evidence that individual tree swallows do not experience some trade-offs equally, and that timing of breeding likely plays a role in how costs of immunity are weighed. To understand how investment in immunity can limit life history traits, we must consider how a variation among individuals influences the relative costs of immunity.  © 2022 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145425772&amp;doi=10.1093%2ficb%2ficac033&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=30777f9add2b8282642c997e9ceba725</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, F.</author><author>Wang, Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>River Systems Geometric Similarity Measurement Method under Hierarchical Analysis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geo-Information Science</secondary-title><short-title>河系几何相似性的层次度量方法</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geo-Information Science</full-title></periodical><pages>2139-2150</pages><volume>23</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.12082/dqxxkx.2021.210279</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The existing line groups geometric similarity measurement methods are mainly based on mathematical statistics. Geometric similarity is calculated through the statistics of overall change information. These methods lack the expression of local features and they are not suitable for river systems with highly fractal features. River systems are the basic elements of maps, and they have obvious fractal features and complex structural features. When we calculate the geometric similarity of river systems, the difference of the overall characteristics before and after cartographic generalization should be included, and the change of the local characteristics should also be considered. To this end, this paper divides geometric characteristics of river system into three levels of information characteristics: The shape characteristics of a single river, the structural characteristics of local area, and the distribution characteristics of global scope. Firstly, Included Angle Chain and Hausdorff distance are combined to calculate the shape similarity of a single river. Then, the local characteristic regions are determined according to the "80/20 Principle". This method is extended to calculate the local structure similarity of M: N river system through coordinate conversion. Finally, the overall feature descriptor is integrated to obtain the global distribution similarity. On this basis, a difference index is constructed to perform similarity calculation and quality evaluation of generalization. The results show that the calculation result of this method is better than the mean index method, and this method can be effectively applied to quality evaluation of generalization. The details are as follows. Firstly, the proposed method makes up for the shortcoming that the mean index method could only measure the overall change information. The changes of global distribution characteristics and local structure characteristics before and after cartographic generalization are expressed in the proposed method. Secondly, the method in this paper is more sensitive than the mean index method, and the calculation results of geometric similarity are more in line with human psychological cognition. Thirdly, the difference index P reflects the degree of generalization, the irrationality of deletion and simplification before and after generalization are detected. © 2021, Science Press.

However, metagenomic data in these populations remains scarce, and the association with soil-transmitted helminth infection status is unclear. Here, we sequenced 650 metagenomes of indigenous Malaysians from five villages with different prevalence of helminth infections. Results: Individuals from villages with higher prevalences of helminth infections have more unmapped reads and greater microbial diversity. Microbial community diversity and composition were most strongly associated with different villages and the effects of helminth infection status on the microbiome varies by village. Longitudinal changes in the microbiome in response to albendazole anthelmintic treatment were observed in both helminth infected and uninfected individuals. Inference of bacterial population replication rates from origin of replication analysis identified specific replicating taxa associated with helminth infection. Conclusions: Our results indicate that helminth effects on the microbiota were highly dependent on context, and effects of albendazole on the microbiota can be confounding for the interpretation of deworming studies. Furthermore, a substantial quantity of the microbiome remains unannotated, and this large dataset from an indigenous population associated with helminth infections is a valuable resource for future studies.

A reproducible study is one where the results can be recreated by using the same methodology and materials as the original researchers. Unfortunately, reproducibility is not a standard to which the majority of research is currently adherent. Methods: Our cross-sectional survey evaluated 300 trials in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Our primary objective was to identify nine indicators of reproducibility and transparency. These indicators include availability of data, analysis scripts, pre-registration information, study protocols, funding source, conflict of interest statements and whether or not the study was available via Open Access. Results: Of the 300 trials in our sample, 208 contained empirical data that could be assessed for reproducibility. None of the trials in our sample provided a link to their protocols or provided a statement on availability of materials. None were replication studies. Just 10.58% provided a statement regarding their data availability, while only 5.82% provided a statement on preregistration. 25.85% failed to report the presence or absence of conflicts of interest and 54.08% did not state the origin of their funding. Conclusion: In the studies we examined, research in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology is not consistently reproducible and frequently lacks conflict of interest disclosure. Consequences of this could be far-reaching and include increased research waste, widespread acceptance of misleading results and erroneous conclusions guiding clinical decision-making. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122439161&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.ejogrb.2021.12.021&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1e70b2eeb0d06503c482ef334bacebda</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Y.</author><author>Lian, Y.</author><author>Peng, S.</author><author>Wang, A.</author><author>Yang, H.</author><author>Li, J.</author><author>Yang, S.</author><author>Zhou, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative Genomic-Based Study of Reproduction-Related Genes in Three Fruit Fly Species</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Genetics</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fgene.2022.893695</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett), Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), and Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) are important pests of fruit and vegetable crops and are difficult to control because of their rapid reproduction rate and egg production. To investigate the key genes regulating reproduction in three fruit fly species, we selected genomic information of three fruit fly species, screened specific genes and single-copy homolog genes, and performed KEGG and GO enrichment analysis on specific genes and single-copy homolog genes of the strong positive select (SP); the results showed that Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett), B. dorsalis (Hendel), and C. capitata (Wiedemann) had seven, 11, and one Vitellogenin-related genes, respectively; Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett) had 84 specific genes enriched in immune system-related pathways; B. dorsalis (Hendel) had 1,121 specific genes enriched in signaling pathways related to cell growth and differentiation; C. capitata (Wiedemann) had 42 specific genes enriched in the degradation and metabolism pathways of exogenous organisms; Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett) may have a stronger immune system; B. dorsalis (Hendel) has a faster developmental and reproductive rate; and C. capitata (Wiedemann) has a higher detoxification capacity. Only one SP single-copy homolog gene (gene name: very long-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial) is enriched in the fatty acid metabolic pathway in both Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett) and B. dorsalis (Hendel) as well as in Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett) and C. capitata (Wiedemann). This study provides a molecular basis for studying the reproductive mechanisms of three fruit fly species and provides a scientific basis for developing effective control strategies for fruit flies.

Therefore, we developed a high-resolution three-dimensional acoustic reproduction evaluation method using ambisonics. The method can analyze reproduction conditions in all directions from the listening position and visualize them in an easy-to-understand 3D figure. The method can analyze direct and indirect sound components separately. By evaluating acoustic reproduction using stereo loudspeakers, we confirmed that this method could visualize the slight deviation of the loudspeakers' position and the direction of the reflected sound. © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147247205&amp;doi=10.1109%2fGCCE56475.2022.10014121&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=26daf8d04d6f7849bfd50dc5d3e3f431</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bierhals, C.G.</author><author>Howard, A.</author><author>Hirst, B.H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reduction of rapid proliferating tumour cell lines by inhibition of the specific glycine transporter glyt1</title><secondary-title>Biomedicines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomedicines</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/biomedicines9121770</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Studies have highlighted the relevance of extracellular glycine and serine in supporting high growth rates of rapidly proliferating tumours. The present study analysed the role of the specific glycine transporter GLYT1 in supplying glycine to cancer cells and maintaining cell proliferation. GLYT1 knockdown in the rapidly proliferating tumour cell lines A549 and HT29 reduced the number of viable cells by approximately 30% and the replication rate presented a decrease of about 50% when compared to cells transfected with control siRNA. In contrast, when compared to control, GLYT1 siRNA had only a minimal effect on cell number of the slowly proliferating tumour cell line A498, reducing the number of viable cells by 7% and no significant difference was observed when analysing the replication rate between GLYT1 knockdown and control group. When utilising a specific GLYT1 inhibitor, ALX-5407, the doubling time of rapidly proliferating cells increased by about 8 h presenting a significant reduction in the number of viable cells after 96 h treatment when compared to untreated cells. Therefore, these results suggest that GLYT1 is required to maintain high proliferation rates in rapidly proliferating cancer cells and encourage further investigation of GLYT1 as a possible target in a novel therapeutic approach. © 2021 by the authors.

It is, however, unclear as to whether sexual reproduction is caused by kairomone per se or indirectly by kairomone-induced crowding. In this study, we cultured Daphnia pulex in the presence of fish kairomone, with newborn offspring being retained (increasing population density) or removed (constant population density). The relationships among fish kairomone, population density, and indicators of sexual reproduction were assessed using structural equation models. The results showed that when offspring were retained in the population, the population density and sexual reproduction by Daphnia simultaneously increased in response to the presence of the fish kairomone, whereas sexual reproduction was not directly affected in the presence of fish kairomones alone. Conversely, when maintaining a constant population density, the number of ephippia and ratio of male to female of Daphnia increased with increasing population density, but the presence of fish kairomone did not promote sexual reproduction. Structural equation model analysis indicated that population density, rather than the fish kairomone, was the significant factor promoting sexual reproduction. The findings of this study indicate that population density directly triggers sexual reproduction in Daphnia populations. Our observations provide new insights into environmentally induced sexual reproduction, and on this basis, we suggest that a more thorough consideration of the interactions among environmental factors in determining sexual reproduction is necessary. © 2022 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134271791&amp;doi=10.1111%2ffwb.13969&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=895de2c5b7bc30b493f18ac5a73eb569</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Axelrud, L.K.</author><author>Simioni, A.R.</author><author>Pine, D.S.</author><author>Winkler, A.M.</author><author>Pan, P.M.</author><author>Sato, J.R.</author><author>Zugman, A.</author><author>Parker, N.</author><author>Picon, F.</author><author>Jackowski, A.</author><author>Hoexter, M.Q.</author><author>Banaschewski, T.</author><author>Barker, G.J.</author><author>Bokde, A.L.W.</author><author>Quinlan, E.B.</author><author>Desrivières, S.</author><author>Flor, H.</author><author>Grigis, A.</author><author>Garavan, H.</author><author>Gowland, P.</author><author>Heinz, A.</author><author>Ittermann, B.</author><author>Martinot, M.L.P.</author><author>Artiges, E.</author><author>Nees, F.</author><author>Orfanos, D.P.</author><author>Lemaitre, H.</author><author>Paus, T.</author><author>Poustka, L.</author><author>Hohmann, S.</author><author>Millenet, S.</author><author>Fröhner, J.H.</author><author>Smolka, M.N.</author><author>Walter, H.</author><author>Whelan, R.</author><author>Schumann, G.</author><author>Martinot, J.-L.</author><author>Satterthwaite, T.</author><author>Rohde, L.A.</author><author>Milham, M.</author><author>Barker, E.D.</author><author>Salum, G.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neuroimaging Association Scores: reliability and validity of aggregate measures of brain structural features linked to mental disorders in youth</title><secondary-title>European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>1895-1906</pages><volume>30</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00787-020-01653-x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In genetics, aggregation of many loci with small effect sizes into a single score improved prediction. Nevertheless, studies applying easily replicable weighted scores to neuroimaging data are lacking. Our aim was to assess the reliability and validity of the Neuroimaging Association Score (NAS), which combines information from structural brain features previously linked to mental disorders. Participants were 726 youth (aged 6–14) from two cities in Brazil who underwent MRI and psychopathology assessment at baseline and 387 at 3-year follow-up. Results were replicated in two samples: IMAGEN (n = 1627) and the Healthy Brain Network (n = 843). NAS were derived by summing the product of each standardized brain feature by the effect size of the association of that brain feature with seven psychiatric disorders documented by previous meta-analyses. NAS were calculated for surface area, cortical thickness and subcortical volumes using T1-weighted scans. NAS reliability, temporal stability and psychopathology and cognition prediction were analyzed. NAS for surface area showed high internal consistency and 3-year stability and predicted general psychopathology and cognition with higher replicability than specific symptomatic domains for all samples. They also predicted general psychopathology with higher replicability than single structures alone, accounting for 1–3% of the variance, but without directionality. The NAS for cortical thickness and subcortical volumes showed lower internal consistency and less replicable associations with behavioural phenotypes. These findings indicate the NAS based on surface area might be replicable markers of general psychopathology, but these links are unlikely to be causal or clinically useful yet. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092343888&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00787-020-01653-x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=16c3912883549de731fbc19b61f99eb0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Avram, M.</author><author>Grothe, M.J.</author><author>Meinhold, L.</author><author>Leucht, C.</author><author>Leucht, S.</author><author>Borgwardt, S.</author><author>Brandl, F.</author><author>Sorg, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lower cholinergic basal forebrain volumes link with cognitive difficulties in schizophrenia</title><secondary-title>Neuropsychopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuropsychopharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>2320-2329</pages><volume>46</volume><number>13</number><issue>13</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41386-021-01070-x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A potential pathophysiological mechanism of cognitive difficulties in schizophrenia is a dysregulated cholinergic system. Particularly, the cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei (BFCN), the source of cortical cholinergic innervation, support multiple cognitive functions, ranging from attention to decision-making. We hypothesized that BFCN structural integrity is altered in schizophrenia and associated with patients’ attentional deficits. We assessed gray matter (GM) integrity of cytoarchitectonically defined BFCN region-of-interest in 72 patients with schizophrenia and 73 healthy controls, matched for age and gender, from the COBRE open-source database, via structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based volumetry. MRI-derived measures of GM integrity (i.e., volumes) were linked with performance on a symbol coding task (SCT), a paper-pencil-based metric that assesses attention, by correlation and mediation analysis. To assess the replicability of findings, we repeated the analyses in an independent dataset comprising 26 patients with schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy controls. BFCN volumes were lower in patients (t(139)=2.51, p = 0.01) and significantly associated with impaired SCT performance (r = 0.31, p = 0.01). Furthermore, lower BFCN volumes mediated the group difference in SCT performance. When including global GM volumes, which were lower in patients, as covariates-of-no-interest, these findings disappeared, indicating that schizophrenia did not have a specific effect on BFCN relative to other regional volume changes. We replicated these findings in the independent cohort, e.g., BFCN volumes were lower in patients and mediated patients’ impaired SCT performance. Results demonstrate lower BFCN volumes in schizophrenia, which link with patients’ attentional deficits. Data suggest that a dysregulated cholinergic system might contribute to cognitive difficulties in schizophrenia via impaired BFCN. © 2021, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109259001&amp;doi=10.1038%2fs41386-021-01070-x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f72b38eefc15aebc4c4eb3d406e2f544</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shartova, N.</author><author>Mironova, V.</author><author>Zelikhinan, S.</author><author>Korennoy, F.</author><author>Grishchenko, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial patterns of West Nile virus distribution in the Volgograd region of Russia, a territory with long-existing foci</title><secondary-title>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</full-title></periodical><volume>16</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pntd.0010145</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Southern Russia remains affected by West Nile virus (WNV). In the current study, we identified the spatial determinants of WNV distribution in an area with endemic virus transmission, with special reference to the urban settings, by mapping probable points of human infection acquisition and points of virus detection in mosquitoes, ticks, birds, and mammals during 1999–2016. The suitability of thermal conditions for extrinsic virus replication was assessed based on the approach of degree-day summation and their changes were estimated by linear trend analysis. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the year-to-year variation of human cases versus thermal conditions. Environmental suitability was determined by ecological niche modelling using MaxEnt software. Human population density was used as an offset to correct for possible bias. Spatial analysis of virus detection in the environment showed significant contributions from surface temperature, altitude, and distance from water bodies. When indicators of location and mobility of the human population were included, the relative impact of factors changed, with roads becoming most important. When the points of probable human case infection were added, the percentage of leading factors changed only slightly. The urban environment significantly increased the epidemic potential of the territory and created quite favorable conditions for virus circulation. The private building sector with low-storey houses and garden plots located in the suburbs provided a connection between urban and rural transmission cycles. Author summary West Nile fever is a zoonotic disease caused by flavivirus infection that dispersed circum-globally by the end of the 20th century. There is the long-existing endemic area in southern Russia (Volgograd region) that remains affected by West Nile virus (WNV) with the maximum number of reported cases in the country. The natural features of the region formed favorable conditions for long-term WNV circulation. At the same time, the urban environment could pose greater hazards for WNV infection in humans. Road density, distance from water bodies, land surface temperature and altitude were identified as the most significant spatial determinants of WNV distribution. The private building sector with low-storey houses and garden plots located in the city suburban area provided connections between urban and rural transmission cycles. Climate change also may favor WNV transmission as increased temperatures affect the sum of effective temperatures necessary for virus extrinsic replication. A statistically significant correlation between WNV human cases and the sum of effective temperatures was found during the last 20 years © 2022 Shartova et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123974014&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0010145&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2b90bd41108325c3b5f5a67f33d4bc99</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pouil, S.</author><author>Stevenson, L.M.</author><author>Goñez-Rodríguez, L.</author><author>Mathews, T.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stannous chloride as a tool for mercury stripping in contaminated streams: Experimental assessment of toxicity in an invertebrate model species</title><secondary-title>Chemosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemosphere</full-title></periodical><volume>296</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133762</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The chronic toxicity of an innovative Hg water treatment system using tin (Sn) (II) chloride (SnCl2) followed by air stripping was assessed through measurements of survival, growth, and reproduction rate in the freshwater cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia, a model species for toxicity testing. We first calculated the concentrations of Hg causing 25% reduction in survival and reproduction (Lethal or Inhibition Concentrations, or LC25 and IC25, for survival and reproduction, respectively) through exposure to aqueous Hg at concentrations ranging from 0 to 25,000 ng L−1. Then, we treated media (DMW and natural stream water) contaminated with Hg at LC25 and IC25 concentrations with SnCl2 at a Sn:Hg stoichiometric ratio of 8:1 and air stripping and exposed C. dubia to this Sn-amended media. Our results showed that Hg significantly affected survival, reproduction rates and impaired growth. SnCl2-treatment removed 100% of the Hg from the media at all concentrations tested with no deleterious effects on survival, growth and reproduction. Our results confirmed the efficacy of SnCl2 in removing aqueous Hg from stream water and showed that the added Sn did not impact C. dubia at the concentrations tested, supporting the suitability of SnCl2-based treatments in appropriate Hg-contaminated environments. © 2022</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124590167&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2022.133762&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b7512ad58acd5921d7be26aed263a792</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hatle, J.D.</author><author>Maslikova, V.</author><author>Short, C.A.</author><author>Bracey, D.</author><author>Darmanjian, M.</author><author>Morningstar, S.</author><author>Reams, B.</author><author>Mashanov, V.S.</author><author>Jahan-Mihan, A.</author><author>Hahn, D.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein storage and reproduction increase in grasshoppers on a diet matched to the amino acids of egg yolk protein</title><secondary-title>Journal of Experimental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Experimental Biology</full-title></periodical><volume>225</volume><number>17</number><issue>17</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jeb.244450</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The diets of animals are essential to support development, and protein is key. Accumulation of stored nutrients can support developmental events such as molting and initiation of reproduction. Agricultural studies have addressed how dietary protein quality affects growth, but few studies have addressed the effects of dietary protein quality on developmental transitions. Studies on how dietary quality may affect protein storage and development are possible in arthropods, which store proteins in the hemolymph.We hypothesized that diets with a composition of amino acids that matches the precursor of egg yolk protein (vitellogenin, Vg) will be high quality and support both egg production and accumulation of storage proteins. Grasshoppers were fed one of two isonitrogenous solutions of amino acids daily: Vg-balanced (matched to Vg) or Unbalanced (same total moles of amino acids, but not matched to egg yolk). We measured reproduction and storage protein levels in serial hemolymph samples from individuals. The Vg-balanced group had greater reproduction and greater cumulative levels of storage proteins than did the Unbalanced group. This occurred even though amino acids fed to the Vg-balanced group were not a better match to storage protein than were the amino acids fed to the Unbalanced group. Further, oviposition timing was best explained by a combination of diet, age at the maximum level of storage protein hexamerin-270 and accumulation of hexamerin-90. Our study tightens the link between storage proteins and commitment to reproduction, and shows that dietary protein quality is vital for protein storage and reproduction.  © 2022.

This study measured six reproduction traits in a Sichuan white goose population (209 individuals), including fertility, qualified egg rate, plasma concentrations of progesterone (P), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin (PRL) and oestrogen (E2). 2. Whole-genome resequencing data from the same goose population (209 individuals) were used in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) utilising a mixed linear model to investigate the genes and genetic markers associated with reproduction traits. The frequency of the selected SNPs and haplotypes were determined using the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method. 3. In total, 42 SNPs significantly associated with these traits were identified. A haplotype block was constructed based on five SNPs that were significantly associated with qualified egg rate, with individuals having the haplotype CCTTAAGGAA having the lowest qualified egg rate. 4. In conclusion, these results provided potential markers for marker-assisted selection to improve goose reproductive performance and a basis for elucidating the genetics of goose reproduction. © 2022 British Poultry Science Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135475096&amp;doi=10.1080%2f00071668.2022.2096402&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=08e8198dc57cce06688621902398ae82</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daoud, M.I.</author><author>Al-Ali, A.</author><author>Alazrai, R.</author><author>Al-Najar, M.S.</author><author>Alsaify, B.A.</author><author>Ali, M.Z.</author><author>Alouneh, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Edge-Based Selection Method for Improving Regions-of-Interest Localizations Obtained Using Multiple Deep Learning Object-Detection Models in Breast Ultrasound Images</title><secondary-title>Sensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors</full-title></periodical><volume>22</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s22186721</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can be used to process breast ultrasound (BUS) images with the goal of enhancing the capability of diagnosing breast cancer. Many CAD systems operate by analyzing the region-of-interest (ROI) that contains the tumor in the BUS image using conventional texture-based classification models and deep learning-based classification models. Hence, the development of these systems requires automatic methods to localize the ROI that contains the tumor in the BUS image. Deep learning object-detection models can be used to localize the ROI that contains the tumor, but the ROI generated by one model might be better than the ROIs generated by other models. In this study, a new method, called the edge-based selection method, is proposed to analyze the ROIs generated by different deep learning object-detection models with the goal of selecting the ROI that improves the localization of the tumor region. The proposed method employs edge maps computed for BUS images using the recently introduced Dense Extreme Inception Network (DexiNed) deep learning edge-detection model. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study that has employed a deep learning edge-detection model to detect the tumor edges in BUS images. The proposed edge-based selection method is applied to analyze the ROIs generated by four deep learning object-detection models. The performance of the proposed edge-based selection method and the four deep learning object-detection models is evaluated using two BUS image datasets. The first dataset, which is used to perform cross-validation evaluation analysis, is a private dataset that includes 380 BUS images. The second dataset, which is used to perform generalization evaluation analysis, is a public dataset that includes 630 BUS images. For both the cross-validation evaluation analysis and the generalization evaluation analysis, the proposed method obtained the overall ROI detection rate, mean precision, mean recall, and mean F1-score values of (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.), respectively. Moreover, the results show that the proposed edge-based selection method outperformed the four deep learning object-detection models as well as three baseline-combining methods that can be used to combine the ROIs generated by the four deep learning object-detection models. These findings suggest the potential of employing our proposed method to analyze the ROIs generated using different deep learning object-detection models to select the ROI that improves the localization of the tumor region. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138333486&amp;doi=10.3390%2fs22186721&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3c6aec04054dbbad4b34a7c07f14e4f8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jorge, D.C.P.</author><author>Oliveira, J.F.</author><author>Miranda, J.G.V.</author><author>Andrade, R.F.S.</author><author>Pinho, S.T.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the effective reproduction number for heterogeneous models using incidence data</title><secondary-title>Royal Society Open Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Royal Society Open Science</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rsos.220005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The effective reproduction number, R(t), plays a key role in the study of infectious diseases, indicating the current average number of new infections caused by an infected individual in an epidemic process. Estimation methods for the time evolution of R(t), using incidence data, rely on the generation interval distribution, g(τ), which is usually obtained from empirical data or theoretical studies using simple epidemic models. However, for systems that present heterogeneity, either on the host population or in the expression of the disease, there is a lack of data and of a suitable general methodology to obtain g(τ). In this work, we use mathematical models to bridge this gap. We present a general methodology for obtaining explicit expressions of the reproduction numbers and the generation interval distributions, within and between model sub-compartments provided by an arbitrary compartmental model. Additionally, we present the appropriate expressions to evaluate those reproduction numbers using incidence data. To highlight the relevance of such methodology, we apply it to the spread of COVID-19 in municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Using two meta-population models, we estimate the reproduction numbers and the contributions of each municipality in the generation of cases in all others. © 2022 The Authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138193949&amp;doi=10.1098%2frsos.220005&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f951921beef42ed52c77e4878e084923</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, J.</author><author>Kajimoto, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Robust Approach for Reproducing the Haptic Sensation of Sandpaper With Different Roughness During Bare Fingertip Interaction</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Virtual Reality</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Virtual Reality</full-title></periodical><volume>3</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/frvir.2022.829946</electronic-resource-num><abstract>When reproducing realistic virtual textures for bare finger interaction, an accelerometer attached to a fingernail is commonly used. This measurement depends on the dynamic conditions during the exploration action, and slight differences in roughness are difficult to acquire accurately because of masking by shivering, low-pass filtering by the finger tissue, and sensor accuracy. We propose a simpler yet robust approach based on the 3D measurement of the surface and compare it with the conventional approach. The 3D surface images of sandpaper with different degrees of roughness were captured using a 3D microscope, and the line roughness curve was transformed into an acceleration curve by quadratic differential transformation. The real-time acceleration and frictional force were measured by an accelerometer and force sensor for comparison. A haptic device replaying acceleration-based vibrations by two audio speakers and producing tangential force by a motor-controlled liner slide was developed for reproduction. We conducted experiments with participants to evaluate the reproduction approach. Experimental results showed that the conventional approach obtained sufficient discriminability with the assistance of force, whereas the proposed approach achieved higher reproducibility and discriminability by sole vibration. Thus, our approach provides a new reference for studies of bare finger interaction with rough surfaces.

Despite improved reporting in CMV-DNAemia, there is no consensus as to what the ideal CMV-DNAemia cutoff for a successful preemptive strategy is. Each transplant centre establishes their own threshold. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of our preventive strategy in CMV IgG+ LTR, and evaluate CMV replication kinetics. Methods: In this retrospective study we determined the incidence of CMV disease in the first 6 months following transplantation in CMV seropositive LTR in a tertiary-care centre in Mexico. Secondary outcomes were determining the number of patients who required preemptive therapy (treatment cutoff ≥ 4000 UI/ml), adherence to the centre’s prevention protocol and calculation of viral replication kinetics. Results: One-hundred and twenty-four patients met inclusion criteria. Four patients (3.2%) developed CMV disease. Ninety-six (85%) had detectable DNAemia and 25 (22%) asymptomatic patients received preemptive therapy, none of them developed CMV disease. The highest viral loads were observed on the second posttransplant month. The number of viral load measurements decreased over time. Patients with DNAemia ≥ 4000 UI/ml had a faster viral load growth rate, shorter viral load duplication time, and higher basic reproductive number. Viral load growth rate and autoimmune hepatitis were associated with development of DNAemia ≥ 4000 UI/ml. Conclusion: Cytomegalovirus disease occurred in 3.2% of the study subjects. Preemptive therapy using a threshold of CMV ≥ 4000 UI/ml was effective in reducing the incidence of end-organ disease. The viral replication parameters described in this population highlight the importance of frequent monitoring, a challenging feat for transplant programs in low- and middle-income countries. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124797948&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12879-022-07123-w&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8999bc89caecb96b59603d2ca7e67134</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ali, S.E.</author><author>Ismail, N.M.</author><author>Khalil, M.T.</author><author>Emam, W.W.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Laboratory studies on the Effect of different temperatures on Biomphalaria alexandrina snails with emphasis on the consequences of global warming</title><secondary-title>Egyptian Journal of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Egyptian Journal of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries</full-title></periodical><pages>877-892</pages><volume>26</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.21608/EJABF.2022.318086</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The objective of the present study was to examine the impact of increasing water temperatures on the survival, growth rate, and reproduction of Biomphalaria alexandrina snails, as well as their susceptibility to Schistosoma mansoni infection. The study examined a range of water temperatures, including 30, 32, and 34°C, and a control group maintained at room temperature. The results indicated that increasing water temperature significantly reduces the survival rate of B. alexandrina snails. The survival rate was 0, 6, 9, and 91% for snail groups at 34, 32, 30 °C, and room temperature, respectively. In contrast, there was no statistical difference between increased temperature (30 and 32 °C) and room temperature on the growth rate of the snails. The mean shell diameters of snails were 9.8 and 9.6 mm at 30 and 32 °C, respectively, compared to 10.03 mm at room temperature. However, the growth rate of snails at 34°C reached 8.4 mm. Increasing water temperature dramatically suppressed the reproduction rate, resulting in fewer egg masses. Snails maintained at room temperature laid eggs in the tenth week and continued to lay eggs till the end of the experiment (14th week). Those exposed to the water temperature of 30 °C were observed to lay eggs in the tenth week; however, after two weeks, they stopped laying. There was no egg laying for the snails exposed to 32 and 34°C throughout the experimental period. This was confirmed by the histological examinations of the hermaphrodite gland, which revealed damage in the gonadal cells, ranging from mild to severe, according to the increase in water temperature. The infection rate of infected snails decreased significantly by increasing the temperature. The total number of produced cercaria decreased sharply by increasing the water temperature. The infected snails produced 2222, 634, and 265 cercariae at 25, 30, and 32°C, respectively. However, at 34 °C, no cercariae were detected in the snails. © 2022, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

Design/methodology/approach: All A-share listed Chinese companies during the year 2008–2017 with 5,144 firm-year observations have been investigated for this study. Findings: This study finds a positive effect of CFO foreign and professional experience on CSR assurance. No significant association has been found between the CFO’s academic experience and CSR assurance. Additional analysis for Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sampled firms shows that the academic and professional experience of CFOs has a significant positive association with CSR assurance. However, the main findings are replicated in the case of firms under mandatory CSR reporting. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study are its generalizability, unidimensional measure of CSR assurance which is unable to capture its quality and explore the other traits of CFOs. Practical implications: It provides assurance practitioners with valuable longitudinal data on China’s CSR reporting and assurance services. Also, firms should recognize the importance of having competent CFOs to improve the credibility of their CSR reporting. The cross-sectional variation analysis (GRI and mandatory CSR) will help firms to assess the value of each CFO attribute for their nonfinancial reporting and auditing choices while considering internal and external stakeholder demands. Originality/value: This study not only updates the existing understanding of CSR assurance methods in China but also explains the significance of CFO-specific experience in enhancing the credibility of nonfinancial reporting. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129206444&amp;doi=10.1108%2fSBR-10-2021-0190&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=07b63f62ad7e89fa80c043053c3877ed</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Motoki, K.</author><author>Iseki, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating replicability of ten influential research on sensory marketing</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Communication</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Communication</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fcomm.2022.1048896</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We attempted to evaluate the replicability and generalizability of ten influential research on sensory marketing by conducting a high-powered and pre-registered replication in online settings in non-WEIRD consumers.

This article proposes a weakly supervised discriminative learning with a spectral constrained generative adversarial network (GAN) for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), called weaklyAD. It can enhance the discrimination between anomaly and background with background homogenization and anomaly saliency in cases where anomalous samples are limited and sensitive to the background. A novel probability-based category thresholding is first proposed to label coarse samples in preparation for weakly supervised learning. Subsequently, a discriminative reconstruction model is learned by the proposed network in a weakly supervised fashion. The proposed network has an end-to-end architecture, which not only includes an encoder, a decoder, a latent layer discriminator, and a spectral discriminator competitively but also contains a novel Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based orthogonal projection divergence (OPD) spectral constraint. Finally, the well-learned network is used to reconstruct HSIs captured by the same sensor. Our work paves a new weakly supervised way for HAD, which intends to match the performance of supervised methods without the prerequisite of manually labeled data. Assessments and generalization experiments over real HSIs demonstrate the unique promise of such a proposed approach.  © 2012 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107325429&amp;doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2021.3082158&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2395a0b19f5f037ff1efb8b620b4b29b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Loaldi, D.</author><author>Regi, F.</author><author>Li, D.</author><author>Giannekas, N.</author><author>Calaon, M.</author><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Tosello, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Product Fingerprints for the Evaluation of Tool/Polymer Replication Quality in Injection Molding at the Micro/Nano Scale</title><secondary-title>Nanomanufacturing and Metrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nanomanufacturing and Metrology</full-title></periodical><pages>278-288</pages><volume>4</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s41871-021-00105-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replication processes for the manufacturing of micro/nano-structured components are characterized by a certain degree of precision and accuracy. The transcription loss, or replication fidelity, defines the geometrical and dimensional correspondence of micro/nano-structure from metal tool inserts into plastic patterned products. The employment of a vast spectrum of micro/nano-structured geometries calls for methodologies that can be used for the estimation of replication fidelity. This study presents a number of product fingerprints, which propose multiple ways to characterize micro/nano structures in replication technologies. Replication fidelity yielded values above 80% and up to 96% depending on the considered product fingerprints and their definition. Thereafter, a correlation of the product fingerprint with the process parameters was found to optimize the replication process. Measurement uncertainty accompanies the analysis of the product fingerprints, enabling a standardized, robust, and quantitative methodology for process learning, modeling, and optimization. © 2021, International Society for Nanomanufacturing and Tianjin University and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106476803&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs41871-021-00105-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6c871416bb4d4580d853b4853fe20196</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Turk, G.</author><author>Seiger, K.</author><author>Lian, X.</author><author>Sun, W.</author><author>Parsons, E.M.</author><author>Gao, C.</author><author>Rassadkina, Y.</author><author>Polo, M.L.</author><author>Czernikier, A.</author><author>Ghiglione, Y.</author><author>Vellicce, A.</author><author>Varriale, J.</author><author>Lai, J.</author><author>Yuki, Y.</author><author>Martin, M.</author><author>Rhodes, A.</author><author>Lewin, S.R.</author><author>Walker, B.D.</author><author>Carrington, M.</author><author>Siliciano, R.</author><author>Siliciano, J.</author><author>Lichterfeld, M.</author><author>Laufer, N.</author><author>Yu, X.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Possible Sterilizing Cure of HIV-1 Infection Without Stem Cell Transplantation</title><secondary-title>Annals of Internal Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Internal Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>95-100</pages><volume>175</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.7326/L21-0297</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: A sterilizing cure of HIV-1 infection has been reported in 2 persons living with HIV-1 who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations from donors who were homozygous for the CCR5D32 gene polymorphism. However, this has been considered elusive during natural infection. Objective: To evaluate persistent HIV-1 reservoir cells in an elite controller with undetectable HIV-1 viremia for more than 8 years in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Design: Detailed investigation of virologic and immunologic characteristics. Setting: Tertiary care centers in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Boston, Massachusetts. Patient: A patient with HIV-1 infection and durable drug-free suppression of HIV-1 replication. Measurements: Analysis of genome-intact and replication-competent HIV-1 using near-full-length individual proviral sequencing and viral outgrowth assays, respectively; analysis of HIV-1 plasma RNA by ultrasensitive HIV-1 viral load testing. Results: No genome-intact HIV-1 proviruses were detected in analysis of a total of 1.188 billion peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 503 million mononuclear cells from placental tissues. Seven defective proviruses, some of them derived from clonally expanded cells, were detected. A viral outgrowth assay failed to retrieve replication-competent HIV-1 from 150 million resting CD4+ T cells. No HIV-1 RNA was detected in 4.5 mL of plasma. Limitations: Absence of evidence for intact HIV-1 proviruses in large numbers of cells is not evidence of absence of intact HIV-1 proviruses. A sterilizing cure of HIV-1 can never be empirically proved. Conclusion: Genome-intact and replication-competent HIV-1 were not detected in an elite controller despite analysis of massive numbers of cells from blood and tissues, suggesting that this patient may have naturally achieved a sterilizing cure of HIV-1 infection. These observations raise the possibility that a sterilizing cure may be an extremely rare but possible outcome of HIV-1 infection. © 2021 American College of Physicians.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124979090&amp;doi=10.7326%2fL21-0297&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4fd6454c296044cb6b852261d2d4fc04</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sobkow, A.</author><author>Surowski, M.</author><author>Olszewska, A.</author><author>Antoniewska, N.</author><author>Barcik, K.</author><author>Bartkiewicz, U.</author><author>Brzeska, A.</author><author>Brzozowska, A.</author><author>Budrewicz, O.</author><author>Choja, J.</author><author>Choma, K.</author><author>Chorbotowicz, P.</author><author>Filimoniak, M.</author><author>Filip, Ł.</author><author>Gambuś, P.</author><author>Gierlik, W.</author><author>Gonczar, T.</author><author>Goryczka, K.</author><author>Góra, M.</author><author>Haczek, M.</author><author>Hetmańczuk, W.</author><author>Holka, Z.</author><author>Janosz, A.</author><author>Kikowska, N.</author><author>Kołcun, J.</author><author>Kozłowska, Z.</author><author>Kujawińska, M.</author><author>Kuleszczyk, M.</author><author>Lach-Galińska, A.</author><author>Latacz, K.</author><author>Ławniczak, A.</author><author>Majewska, K.</author><author>Makowska, K.</author><author>Mamzer, M.</author><author>Marciniszyn, I.</author><author>Masternak, A.</author><author>Matuszek, M.</author><author>Mehr, J.</author><author>Miela, E.</author><author>Mleczko, M.</author><author>Morga, P.</author><author>Niemczyk, M.</author><author>Ostrowski, D.</author><author>Pełdiak, J.</author><author>Piotrowicz, K.</author><author>Płuciennik, A.</author><author>Ryśkiewicz, O.</author><author>Sekuła, W.</author><author>Sikora, M.</author><author>Sikora, N.</author><author>Sitko, D.</author><author>Sobczak, A.</author><author>Sosenko, J.</author><author>Stando, S.</author><author>Starek, K.</author><author>Ślak, Ł.</author><author>Świtała, J.</author><author>Świtniewska, N.</author><author>Tyc, A.</author><author>Urban, O.</author><author>Wcisło, N.</author><author>Wiśniewska, K.</author><author>Wodzińska, J.</author><author>Zabiełło, A.</author><author>Żygadło, M.</author><author>Zaleskiewicz, T.</author><author>Traczyk, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conceptual replication study of fifteen JDM effects: Insights from the Polish sample</title><secondary-title>Polish Psychological Bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Polish Psychological Bulletin</full-title></periodical><pages>138-151</pages><volume>53</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.24425/ppb.2022.141862</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We conducted pre-registered replications of 15 effects in the field of judgment and decision making (JDM).

In these large-scale replication projects, replication has typically been evaluated based on a single replication study of some original study and dichotomously as successful or failed. However, evaluations of replicability that are based on a single study and are dichotomous are inadequate, and evaluations of replicability should instead be based on multiple studies, be continuous, and be multi-faceted. Further, such evaluations are in fact possible due to two characteristics shared by many large-scale replication projects. In this article, we provide such an evaluation for two prominent large-scale replication projects, one which replicated a phenomenon from cognitive psychology and another which replicated 13 phenomena from social psychology and behavioral economics. Our results indicate a very high degree of replicability in the former and a medium to low degree of replicability in the latter. They also suggest an unidentified covariate in each, namely ocular dominance in the former and political ideology in the latter, that is theoretically pertinent. We conclude by discussing evaluations of replicability at large, recommendations for future large-scale replication projects, and design-based model generalization.

Large replication projects in psychology and cancer biology have evaluated the replicability of their fields but no collaborative effort has been undertaken in sports and exercise science. We propose to undertake such an effort here. As this is the first large replication project in this field, there is no agreed-upon protocol for selecting studies to replicate. Criticism of previous selection protocols include claims they were non-randomised and non-representative. Any selection protocol in sports and exercise science must be representative to provide an accurate estimate of replicability of the field. Our aim is to produce a protocol for selecting studies to replicate for inclusion in a large replication project in sports and exercise science. Methods: The proposed selection protocol uses multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria for replication study selection, including: the year of publication and citation rankings, research disciplines, study types, the research question and key dependent variable, study methods and feasibility. Studies selected for replication will be stratified into pools based on instrumentation and expertise required, and will then be allocated to volunteer laboratories for replication. Replication outcomes will be assessed using a multiple inferential strategy and descriptive information will be reported regarding the final number of included and excluded studies, and original author responses to requests for raw data. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137830101&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs40279-022-01749-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6d8dffc8f6d6ced2b0c19862955da207</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Võsa, U.</author><author>Claringbould, A.</author><author>Westra, H.-J.</author><author>Bonder, M.J.</author><author>Deelen, P.</author><author>Zeng, B.</author><author>Kirsten, H.</author><author>Saha, A.</author><author>Kreuzhuber, R.</author><author>Yazar, S.</author><author>Brugge, H.</author><author>Oelen, R.</author><author>de Vries, D.H.</author><author>van der Wijst, M.G.P.</author><author>Kasela, S.</author><author>Pervjakova, N.</author><author>Alves, I.</author><author>Favé, M.-J.</author><author>Agbessi, M.</author><author>Christiansen, M.W.</author><author>Jansen, R.</author><author>Seppälä, I.</author><author>Tong, L.</author><author>Teumer, A.</author><author>Schramm, K.</author><author>Hemani, G.</author><author>Verlouw, J.</author><author>Yaghootkar, H.</author><author>Sönmez Flitman, R.</author><author>Brown, A.</author><author>Kukushkina, V.</author><author>Kalnapenkis, A.</author><author>Rüeger, S.</author><author>Porcu, E.</author><author>Kronberg, J.</author><author>Kettunen, J.</author><author>Lee, B.</author><author>Zhang, F.</author><author>Qi, T.</author><author>Hernandez, J.A.</author><author>Arindrarto, W.</author><author>Beutner, F.</author><author>’t Hoen, P.A.C.</author><author>van Meurs, J.</author><author>van Dongen, J.</author><author>van Iterson, M.</author><author>Swertz, M.A.</author><author>Jan Bonder, M.</author><author>Dmitrieva, J.</author><author>Elansary, M.</author><author>Fairfax, B.P.</author><author>Georges, M.</author><author>Heijmans, B.T.</author><author>Hewitt, A.W.</author><author>Kähönen, M.</author><author>Kim, Y.</author><author>Knight, J.C.</author><author>Kovacs, P.</author><author>Krohn, K.</author><author>Li, S.</author><author>Loeffler, M.</author><author>Marigorta, U.M.</author><author>Mei, H.</author><author>Momozawa, Y.</author><author>Müller-Nurasyid, M.</author><author>Nauck, M.</author><author>Nivard, M.G.</author><author>Penninx, B.W.J.H.</author><author>Pritchard, J.K.</author><author>Raitakari, O.T.</author><author>Rotzschke, O.</author><author>Slagboom, E.P.</author><author>Stehouwer, C.D.A.</author><author>Stumvoll, M.</author><author>Sullivan, P.</author><author>Thiery, J.</author><author>Tönjes, A.</author><author>van Dongen, J.</author><author>Veldink, J.H.</author><author>Völker, U.</author><author>Warmerdam, R.</author><author>Wijmenga, C.</author><author>Swertz, M.</author><author>Andiappan, A.</author><author>Montgomery, G.W.</author><author>Ripatti, S.</author><author>Perola, M.</author><author>Kutalik, Z.</author><author>Dermitzakis, E.</author><author>Bergmann, S.</author><author>Frayling, T.</author><author>Prokisch, H.</author><author>Ahsan, H.</author><author>Pierce, B.L.</author><author>Lehtimäki, T.</author><author>Boomsma, D.I.</author><author>Psaty, B.M.</author><author>Gharib, S.A.</author><author>Awadalla, P.</author><author>Milani, L.</author><author>Ouwehand, W.H.</author><author>Downes, K.</author><author>Stegle, O.</author><author>Battle, A.</author><author>Visscher, P.M.</author><author>Yang, J.</author><author>Scholz, M.</author><author>Powell, J.</author><author>Gibson, G.</author><author>Esko, T.</author><author>Franke, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Large-scale cis- and trans-eQTL analyses identify thousands of genetic loci and polygenic scores that regulate blood gene expression</title><secondary-title>Nature Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1300-1310</pages><volume>53</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41588-021-00913-z</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Trait-associated genetic variants affect complex phenotypes primarily via regulatory mechanisms on the transcriptome. To investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88% of genes, and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL (detected for 37% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested) showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication power and confounding by cell type composition. However, replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors. Expression of 13% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex phenotypes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115732255&amp;doi=10.1038%2fs41588-021-00913-z&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a53f91ae4cbeb4254d8647876ea7bb6e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ahmad, D.</author><author>Zehra, A.</author><author>Jalal, A.</author><author>Ali, W.</author><author>Khan, M.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determination of the genetic diversity in populations of halophytic grass S. ioclados using PBA markers</title><secondary-title>Kuwait Journal of Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Kuwait Journal of Science</full-title></periodical><volume>49</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.48129/kjs.12893</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The genetic structure of salt-tolerant halophytic grass Sporobolus ioclados collected from inland and coastal areas of Pakistan was determined using P450 based analog, the functional genomic markers. Our data revealed high polymorphism (96%) in the collected germplasm. The high genetic variability could be attributed to outcrossing and sexual reproduction. An analysis of molecular variance depicted higher genetic diversity (80%) within the populations and lower (20%) among the populations. The low genetic diversity among the inland and coastal populations might be due to fragmentation and long physical distances. The dendrogram and principal component analysis clearly distinguished the genotypes of the two populations into two distinct clusters. Our data demonstrated that P450 based analog markers are reliable and reproducible for assessing genetic diversity in halophytic grass and provide valuable insight for future breeding and conservation programs. © 2022 University of Kuwait.

These bacteria have peculiar ribosomal structures, reduced metabolic capacities, small genome, and cell sizes, and a general host-associated lifestyle was proposed for the radiation. So far, most CPR genomes were obtained from groundwaters; however, their diversity, abundance, and role in surface freshwaters is largely unexplored. Here, we attempt to close these knowledge gaps by deep metagenomic sequencing of 119 samples of 17 different freshwater lakes located in Europe and Asia. Moreover, we applied Fluorescence in situ Hybridization followed by Catalyzed Reporter Deposition (CARD-FISH) for a first visualization of distinct CPR lineages in freshwater samples. Results: A total of 174 dereplicated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of diverse CPR lineages were recovered from the investigated lakes, with a higher prevalence from hypolimnion samples (162 MAGs). They have reduced genomes (median size 1 Mbp) and were generally found in low abundances (0.02–14.36 coverage/Gb) and with estimated slow replication rates. The analysis of genomic traits and CARD-FISH results showed that the radiation is an eclectic group in terms of metabolic capabilities and potential lifestyles, ranging from what appear to be free-living lineages to host- or particle-associated groups. Although some complexes of the electron transport chain were present in the CPR MAGs, together with ion-pumping rhodopsins and heliorhodopsins, we believe that they most probably adopt a fermentative metabolism. Terminal oxidases might function in O2 scavenging, while heliorhodopsins could be involved in mitigation against oxidative stress. Conclusions: A high diversity of CPR MAGs was recovered, and distinct CPR lineages did not seem to be limited to lakes with specific trophic states. Their reduced metabolic capacities resemble the ones described for genomes in groundwater and animal-associated samples, apart from Gracilibacteria that possesses more complete metabolic pathways. Even though this radiation is mostly host-associated, we also observed organisms from different clades (ABY1, Paceibacteria, Saccharimonadia) that appear to be unattached to any other organisms or were associated with ‘lake snow’ particles (ABY1, Gracilibacteria), suggesting a broad range of potential life-strategies in this phylum.

This study examines the generation and utility of synthetic samples of colonoscopy images with polyps for data augmentation. Methods: We modify and train a pix2pix model to generate synthetic colonoscopy samples with polyps to augment the original dataset. Subsequently, we create a variety of datasets by varying the quantity of synthetic samples and traditional augmentation samples, to train a U-Net network and Faster R-CNN model for segmentation and detection of polyps, respectively. We compare the performance of the models when trained with the resulting datasets in terms of F1 score, intersection over union, precision and recall. Further, we compare the performances of the models with unseen polyp datasets to assess their generalization ability. Results: The average F1 coefficient and intersection over union are improved with increasing number of synthetic samples in U-Net over all test datasets. The performance of the Faster R-CNN model is also improved in terms of polyp detection, while decreasing the false-negative rate. Further, the experimental results for polyp detection outperform similar studies in the literature on the ETIS-PolypLaribDB dataset. Conclusion: By varying the quantity of synthetic and traditional augmentation, there is the potential to control the sensitivity of deep learning models in polyp segmentation and detection. Further, GAN-based augmentation is a viable option for improving the performance of models for polyp segmentation and detection. © 2022, CARS.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131566644&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs11548-022-02651-x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c357f716f6a0407e8337a6b0d475dab1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wong, V.C.</author><author>Anglin, K.</author><author>Steiner, P.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Design-Based Approaches to Causal Replication Studies</title><secondary-title>Prevention Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Prevention Science</full-title></periodical><pages>723-738</pages><volume>23</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11121-021-01234-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent interest in promoting replication efforts assumes that there is well-established methodological guidance for designing and implementing these studies. However, no such consensus exists in the methodology literature. This article addresses these challenges by describing design-based approaches for planning systematic replication studies. Our general approach is derived from the Causal Replication Framework (CRF), which formalizes the assumptions under which replication success can be expected. The assumptions may be understood broadly as replication design requirements and individual study design requirements. Replication failure occurs when one or more CRF assumptions are violated. In design-based approaches to replication, CRF assumptions are systematically tested to evaluate the replicability of effects, as well as to identify sources of effect variation when replication failure is observed. The paper describes research designs for replication and demonstrates how multiple designs may be combined in systematic replication efforts, as well as how diagnostic measures may be used to assess the extent to which CRF assumptions are met in field settings. © 2021, Society for Prevention Research.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122154449&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs11121-021-01234-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0483ff23a011fc691748e72140cecf25</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Perry, T.</author><author>Morris, R.</author><author>Lea, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A decade of replication study in education?

Of the few which are conducted, many are conceptual rather than direct replications. With so few replication studies, and many of those that are attempted producing null results, the scientific status of the evidence base for educational policy and practice is in question. Replicating Makel and Plucker’s review of the education replication literature, conducted in 2014, this paper presents a mapping review looking at rates of replication in education research from 2011 to 2020. We provide an overview of the number of replication studies by replication type, year, outcome, authorship, and journal. Our results are consistent with those of Makel and Plucker, revealing very low but gradually increasing rates of replication study in education. We discuss the role of replication in producing a robust and trustworthy evidence base for policy and practice, and some of the challenges in operationalising definitions of replication we encountered. © 2022 The Author(s).

The reported proportion of findings that these programs determined failed to replicate have become important statistics in the replication crisis. However, these “failure rates” are based on decisions about whether individual studies replicated, which are themselves subject to statistical uncertainty. In this article, we examine how that uncertainty impacts the accuracy of reported failure rates and find that the reported failure rates can be substantially biased and highly variable. Indeed, very high or very low failure rates could arise from chance alone. © 2022 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131549627&amp;doi=10.1080%2f00273171.2022.2066500&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=76d5d9170e819c1acee0660249f65c53</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pawel, S.</author><author>Held, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The sceptical Bayes factor for the assessment of replication success</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

We propose a novel approach combining reverse-Bayes analysis with Bayesian hypothesis testing: a sceptical prior is determined for the effect size such that the original finding is no longer convincing in terms of a Bayes factor. This prior is then contrasted to an advocacy prior (the reference posterior of the effect size based on the original study), and replication success is declared if the replication data favour the advocacy over the sceptical prior at a higher level than the original data favoured the sceptical prior over the null hypothesis. The sceptical Bayes factor is the highest level where replication success can be declared. A comparison to existing methods reveals that the sceptical Bayes factor combines several notions of replicability: it ensures that both studies show sufficient evidence against the null and penalises incompatibility of their effect estimates. Analysis of asymptotic properties and error rates, as well as case studies from the Social Sciences Replication Project show the advantages of the method for the assessment of replicability. © 2022 The Authors.

Directional range shifting is one mechanism of escape, but requires the successful colonization of habitats where interspecific interactions may differ from those to which a species has adapted. For plants with multiple reproductive strategies, these range-edge interactions may alter the investment or allocation toward a given reproductive strategy. In this study, we quantified sexual reproduction of the clonal marsh grass Spartina patens across an inland colonization front into maritime forest being driven by sea-level rise. We find that flowering is variable across S. patens meadows, but consistently reduced in low light conditions like those of the forest understory. Observational surveys of S. patens flowering at four sites in the Delmarva Peninsula agreed with the results of two experimental manipulations of light availability (shading experiment in S. patens-dominated marsh and a forest dieback manipulation). These three approaches pinpointed light limitation as a principal control on S. patens flowering capacity, suggesting that light competition with taller upland species can suppress S. patens flowering along its upland migration front. Consequently, all propagation in shaded conditions must occur clonally or via seeds from the marsh, a reproductive restriction that could limit the potential for local adaptation and reduce genetic diversity. Future research is needed to determine whether the lack of flowering is the result of a trade-off between sexual and clonal reproduction or results from insufficient photosynthetic products needed to achieve either reproductive method. © 2022 Botanical Society of America.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127599674&amp;doi=10.1002%2fajb2.1831&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d68b6e6273383906579a2f7185088ab9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, W.</author><author>Fan, H.</author><author>Zhu, J.</author><author>Wen, H.</author><author>Xie, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Research on Generalized Hybrid Probability Convolutional Neural Network</title><secondary-title>Applied Sciences (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Sciences (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><number>21</number><issue>21</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/app122111301</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper first studies the generalization ability of the convolutional layer as a feature mapper (CFM) for extracting image features and the classification ability of the multilayer perception (MLP) in a CNN. Then, a novel generalized hybrid probability convolutional neural network (GHP-CNN) is proposed to solve abstract feature classification with an unknown distribution form. To measure the generalization ability of the CFM, a new index is defined and the positive correlation between it and the CFM is researched. Generally, a fully trained CFM can extract features that are beneficial to classification, regardless of whether the data participate in training the CFM. In the CNN, the fully connected layer in the MLP is not always optimal, and the extracted abstract feature has an unknown distribution. Thus, an improved classifier called the structure-optimized probabilistic neural network (SOPNN) is used for abstract feature classification in the GHP-CNN. In the SOPNN, the separability information is not lost in the normalization process, and the final classification surface is close to the optimal classification surface under the Bayesian criterion. The proposed GHP-CNN utilizes the generalization ability of the CFM and the classification ability of the SOPNN. Experiments show that the proposed network has better classification ability than the existing hybrid neural networks. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141825169&amp;doi=10.3390%2fapp122111301&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0cf0b9ec0030aef460f0811ac408f104</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cooper, S.E.</author><author>van Dis, E.A.M.</author><author>Hagenaars, M.A.</author><author>Krypotos, A.-M.</author><author>Nemeroff, C.B.</author><author>Lissek, S.</author><author>Engelhard, I.M.</author><author>Dunsmoor, J.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A meta-analysis of conditioned fear generalization in anxiety-related disorders</title><secondary-title>Neuropsychopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuropsychopharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>1652-1661</pages><volume>47</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41386-022-01332-2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Generalization of conditioned fear is adaptive in some situations but maladaptive when fear excessively generalizes to innocuous stimuli with incidental resemblance to a genuine threat cue. Recently, empirical interest in fear generalization as a transdiagnostic explanatory mechanism underlying anxiety-related disorders has accelerated. As there are now several studies of fear generalization across multiple types of anxiety-related disorders, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting behavioral measures (subjective ratings and psychophysiological indices) of fear generalization in anxiety-related disorder vs. comparison groups. We conducted systematic searches of electronic databases (conducted from January–October 2020) for fear generalization studies involving anxiety-related disorder groups or subclinical analog groups. A total of 300 records were full-text screened and two unpublished datasets were obtained, yielding 16 studies reporting behavioral fear generalization measures. Random-effects meta-analytic models and meta-regressions were applied to the identified data. Fear generalization was significantly heightened in anxiety-related disorder participants (N = 439) relative to comparison participants (N = 428). We did not identify any significant clinical, sample, or methodological moderators. Heightened fear generalization is quantitatively supported as distinguishing anxiety-related disorder groups from comparison groups. Evidence suggests this effect is transdiagnostic, relatively robust to experimental or sample parameters, and that generalization paradigms are a well-supported framework for neurobehavioral investigations of learning and emotion in anxiety-related disorders. We discuss these findings in the context of prior fear conditioning meta-analyses, past neuroimaging investigations of fear generalization in anxiety-related disorders, and future directions and challenges for the field. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129288546&amp;doi=10.1038%2fs41386-022-01332-2&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d4499a17a99a55029a0ac6dc2604b24c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abdulkadir, M.</author><author>Yu, D.</author><author>Osiecki, L.</author><author>King, R.A.</author><author>Fernandez, T.V.</author><author>Brown, L.W.</author><author>Cheon, K.-A.</author><author>Coffey, B.J.</author><author>Garcia-Delgar, B.</author><author>Gilbert, D.L.</author><author>Grice, D.E.</author><author>Hagstrøm, J.</author><author>Hedderly, T.</author><author>Heyman, I.</author><author>Hong, H.J.</author><author>Huyser, C.</author><author>Ibanez-Gomez, L.</author><author>Kim, Y.K.</author><author>Kim, Y.-S.</author><author>Koh, Y.-J.</author><author>Kook, S.</author><author>Kuperman, S.</author><author>Leventhal, B.</author><author>Madruga-Garrido, M.</author><author>Maras, A.</author><author>Mir, P.</author><author>Morer, A.</author><author>Münchau, A.</author><author>Plessen, K.J.</author><author>Roessner, V.</author><author>Shin, E.-Y.</author><author>Song, D.-H.</author><author>Song, J.</author><author>Visscher, F.</author><author>Zinner, S.H.</author><author>Mathews, C.A.</author><author>Scharf, J.M.</author><author>Tischfield, J.A.</author><author>Heiman, G.A.</author><author>Dietrich, A.</author><author>Hoekstra, P.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigation of gene–environment interactions in relation to tic severity</title><secondary-title>Journal of Neural Transmission</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Neural Transmission</full-title></periodical><pages>1757-1765</pages><volume>128</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00702-021-02396-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder with involvement of genetic and environmental factors. We investigated genetic loci previously implicated in Tourette syndrome and associated disorders in interaction with pre- and perinatal adversity in relation to tic severity using a case-only (N = 518) design. We assessed 98 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from (I) top SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of TS; (II) top SNPs from GWASs of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD); (III) SNPs previously implicated in candidate-gene studies of TS; (IV) SNPs previously implicated in OCD or ASD; and (V) tagging SNPs in neurotransmitter-related candidate genes. Linear regression models were used to examine the main effects of the SNPs on tic severity, and the interaction effect of these SNPs with a cumulative pre- and perinatal adversity score. Replication was sought for SNPs that met the threshold of significance (after correcting for multiple testing) in a replication sample (N = 678). One SNP (rs7123010), previously implicated in a TS meta-analysis, was significantly related to higher tic severity. We found a gene–environment interaction for rs6539267, another top TS GWAS SNP. These findings were not independently replicated. Our study highlights the future potential of TS GWAS top hits in gene–environment studies. © 2021, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112353887&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00702-021-02396-y&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=772212aeef8c1b6952b8dbf74223692c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zou, J.</author><author>Zhou, J.</author><author>Faller, S.</author><author>Brown, R.P.</author><author>Sankararaman, S.S.</author><author>Eskin, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Accurate modeling of replication rates in genome-wide association studies by accounting for Winner's Curse and study-specific heterogeneity</title><secondary-title>G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/g3journal/jkac261</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with complex human traits, but only a fraction of variants identified in discovery studies achieve significance in replication studies. Replication in genome-wide association studies has been well-studied in the context of Winner's Curse, which is the inflation of effect size estimates for significant variants due to statistical chance. However, Winner's Curse is often not sufficient to explain lack of replication. Another reason why studies fail to replicate is that there are fundamental differences between the discovery and replication studies. A confounding factor can create the appearance of a significant finding while actually being an artifact that will not replicate in future studies. We propose a statistical framework that utilizes genome-wide association studies and replication studies to jointly model Winner's Curse and study-specific heterogeneity due to confounding factors. We apply this framework to 100 genome-wide association studies from the Human Genome-Wide Association Studies Catalog and observe that there is a large range in the level of estimated confounding. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to distinguish when studies fail to replicate due to statistical noise and when they fail due to confounding.  © The Author(s) 2022.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143180260&amp;doi=10.1093%2fg3journal%2fjkac261&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fc4eb3d44f89f59068f3481b71c6c5e9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gong, X.</author><author>Xie, Z.</author><author>Zhou, L.</author><author>He, Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A two-tuple model based spatial direction similarity measurement method</title><secondary-title>Cehui Xuebao/Acta Geodaetica et Cartographica Sinica</secondary-title><short-title>空间方向相似性二元组模型度量方法</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cehui Xuebao/Acta Geodaetica et Cartographica Sinica</full-title></periodical><pages>1705-1716</pages><volume>50</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.11947/j.AGCS.2021.20200361</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aiming at problems that in direction relation matrix model, recognition ability for distinguishing direction changes in the same cardinal direction is insufficient, the direction distance references for different cardinal directions are defined incompletely, and the distance calculation between arbitrarily direction relation matrices is not accurate enough, this paper proposes a direction relation two-tuple model, which combines grid-based direction relation matrix and centroid-based direction relation matrix to concern both distribution ratio variations and centroid position variations for objects, thus distinguishing the direction difference in the same cardinal direction. Meanwhile, the traditional neighborhood graph is optimized based on human spatial cognition, and a centroid direction distance reference suitable for arbitrarily direction relationships is established. Finally the Earth mover's distance (EMD) is utilized to further improve the accuracy of distance calculation between direction relation two-tuples.

Current studies focus on the fundamental understanding of general minimax problems with an emphasis on convergence behavior. As a comparison, there is far less work to study the generalization performance. Additionally, existing generalization bounds are almost all derived in expectation, and the high probability bounds are all presented in the slow order O(1/√n), where n is the sample size. In this paper, we provide improved generalization analyses and obtain sharper high probability generalization bounds for most existing generalization measures of minimax problems. We then use the improved learning bounds to establish high probability generalization bounds with fast rates for classical empirical saddle point (ESP) solution and several popular gradient-based optimization algorithms, including gradient descent ascent (GDA), stochastic gradient descent ascent (SGDA), proximal point method (PPM), extra-gradient (EG), and optimistic gradient descent ascent (OGDA). In summary, we provide a systematical analysis of sharper generalization bounds of minimax problems. © 2022 ICLR 2022 - 10th International Conference on Learning Representationss.

Due to their low opportunity costs and high availability, university students are frequently recruited as the study population. Even though they are rather untypical with regard to many characteristics (e.g. age and income) compared to the representatives of the social group of interest, the experimental behaviours of students are sometimes prematurely generalised to other social groups or even to humans in general. Given the widespread challenges in the agricultural and environmental sector, it is particularly interesting to address farmers' decision-making. We analyse whether agricultural students can be used to approximate the behaviour of farmers in simple economic experiments, which are often used to measure risk aversion, impatience, positive reciprocity, negative reciprocity, altruism and trust. Moreover, we consider the role of systematically varied monetary incentives. We find no differences between agricultural students and farmers in their risk aversion; farmers' positive reciprocity and trust are positively associated with the incentive level, which cannot be observed with agricultural students. Findings regarding altruism in the two populations are mixed and challenge the finding of earlier studies of students being less pro-social. Agricultural students are a lower boundary of impatience and negative reciprocity. These heterogeneous results suggest that scientific inference from agricultural students to farmers should be made cautiously. However, we do not deal with a representative sample of our target population (e.g. gender). Replication studies are required to evaluate the generalisability of our findings. © 2022 The Authors.

Deep learning-based SAR ship recognition performance is largely dependent on the sample set used. SAR ship recognition datasets published in recent years, however, are most derived from a single SAR satellite sensor. It needs to be evaluated and analyzed carefully whether the model trained by a single satellite dataset can still achieve the same accuracy with different SAR satellites. This article focuses on the following research to address these issues. First, using multiple SAR satellite sensors, we create a new SAR ship dataset (named generalization performance evaluation dataset, GPED) containing multiresolution and multipolarization data to examine the generalization performance of the deep learning-based SAR ship recognition method. GPED and a marine target detection dataset (MTDD) are then used to evaluate and analyze the generalization performance of current mainstream deep learning methods. According to the the experiment results, the mean average accuracy of the ship recognition model trained on GPED is generally higher than that of MTDD, which proves that the GPED has a better generalization performance. Furthermore, SAR ship detection datasets have more samples than ship recognition datasets, which inspired us to use transfer learning to transfer knowledge from ship detection to ship recognition. In this article, a method for ship recognition based on transfer learning that utilizes the knowledge gained from the ship detection task is proposed. The method includes two modules: 1) pretraining module and 2) fine-tuning module. It can apply samples of unlabeled ship types to ship recognition, thus reducing the number of labeled samples that are required for ship recognition.

In this study, we experimentally evolved wild-type Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and its isogenic derivative that has two additional replication origins and shows higher background fitness. During the short time of experimental evolution, the fitness gains of the two E. coli strains with different fitness backgrounds converged. Populational genome sequencing revealed various mutations with different allele frequencies in evolved populations. Several mutations occurred in genes affecting transcriptional regulation (e.g., RNA polymerase subunit, RNase, ppGpp synthetase, and transcription termination/antitermination factor genes). When we introduced mutations into the ancestral E. coli strains, beneficial effects tended to be lower in the ancestor with higher initial fitness. Replication rate analysis showed that the various replication indices do not correlate with the growth rate. Transcriptome profiling showed that gene expression and gene ontology are markedly enriched in populations with lower background fitness after experimental evolution. Further, the degree of transcriptional change was proportional to the fitness gain. Thus, the evolutionary trajectories of bacteria with different fitness backgrounds can be complex and counterintuitive. Notably, transcriptional change is a major contributor to adaptability.

The lncRNA HULC was found to be upregulated in human hepatoma tissues. HULC is thought to be involved in multiple steps of hepatoma development and progression; however, the relationship between HULC and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, which is a leading cause of hepatoma, remains unclear. Methods: We examined the effect of HCV replication on HULC expression and the underlying mechanism using cell culture systems. Subsequently, we tested the effect of HULC suppression and overexpression on HCV replication. Finally, we examined the impact of HCV eradication on HULC expression using human liver tissue and blood samples. Results: HCV replication increased HULC expression in cell cultures. A promoter assay showed that an HCV nonstructural protein, NS5A, increased HULC transcription. HULC suppression inhibited HCV replication; conversely, its overexpression enhanced HCV replication. These effects on HCV replication seemed to occur by the modification of HCV translation. Measurements from human liver and blood samples showed that HCV eradication significantly reduced HULC levels in the liver and blood. Conclusions: HCV infection increases HULC expression in vitro and in vivo. HULC modulates HCV replication through an HCV internal ribosome entry site-directed translation step.  © 2020 The Author(s).

There are various solutions on secure routing protocols that are developed to count the well- known attacks. This network is always highly vulnerable to attackers due to wireless communication medium. This is quite easy for attackers to access the wireless medium and easily enter into the network. So, any kind of attacks occur in the network degrades the network performance and increases the packet overhead in the network. In this paper, we have proposed enhanced ant colony-based AODV (EAAODV) protocol for the analysis of gray and black-hole attack effects. A comparative analysis is shown among energy aware ant colony optimisation (EAACO) and enhanced AODV (EAODV) protocols. We compared the performance of these protocols based on various QoS parameters like delay, control overhead, throughput and the packet delivery ratio. The reproduction results show that our protocol performance clarity is better than others.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included MRI scans acquired between 2016 and 2019 from 100 patients (mean age ± SD, 55 years ± 13; 72 men) across various clinical abnormalities with use of a modified Look-Locker inversion recovery, or MOLLI, sequence to quantify native T1 (T1native), postcontrast T1 (T1post), and extracellular volume (ECV). Data were divided into training (n = 60) and internal (n = 40) test subsets. “Synthetic” T1-weighted images were generated from the T1 exponential inversion-recovery signal model at a range of optimal inversion times, yielding high blood-myocardium contrast, and were used for contrast-based image augmentation during training and testing of a convolutional neural network for myocardial segmentation. Automated segmentation, T1, and ECV were compared with experts with use of Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs), correlation coefficients, and Bland-Altman analysis. An external test dataset (n = 147) was used to assess model generalization. Results: Internal testing showed high myocardial DSC relative to experts (0.81 ± 0.08), which was similar to interobserver DSC (0.81 ± 0.08). Automated segmental measurements strongly correlated with experts (T1native, R = 0.87; T1post, R = 0.91; ECV, R = 0.92), which were similar to interobserver correlation (T1native, R = 0.86; T1post, R = 0.94; ECV, R = 0.95). External testing showed strong DSC (0.80 ± 0.09) and T1native correlation (R = 0.88) between automatic and expert analysis. Conclusion: This deep learning method leveraging synthetic contrast augmentation may provide accurate automated T1 and ECV analysis for cardiac MRI data acquired across different abnormalities, centers, scanners, and T1 sequences. © RSNA, 2022.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143977226&amp;doi=10.1148%2fryai.210294&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=51bb04ff8cc833226e88961fc43f982e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Elliott, S.</author><author>Gouriéroux, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimated reproduction ratios in the SIR model</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Statistics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Statistics</full-title></periodical><pages>992-1017</pages><volume>49</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/cjs.11663</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this article is to understand the extreme variability in estimates of the reproduction ratio R0 observed in practice.

As a compositional learning problem (human-verb-object), studying its generalization matters. However, widely-used metric mean average precision (mAP) maybe not enough to model the compositional generalization well. Here, we propose a novel metric, mPD (mean Performance Degradation), as a complementary of mAP to evaluate the performance gap among compositions of different objects and the same verb. Surprisingly, mPD reveals that previous state-of-the-arts usually do not generalize well. With mPD as a cue, we propose Object Category (OC) Immunity to advance HOI generalization. Concretely, our core idea is to prevent model from learning spurious object-verb correlations as a short-cut to over-fit the train set. To achieve OC-immunity, we propose an OC-immune network that decouples the inputs from OC, extracts OC-immune representations and leverages uncertainty quantification to generalize to unseen objects. In both conventional and zero-shot experiments, our method achieves decent improvements. To fully evaluate the generalization, we design a new and more difficult benchmark, on which we present significant advantage. The code is available at https://github.com/Foruck/OC-Immunity.

This study proposed the Developmental Model of Computational Thinking through validating the structural relationships among the five factors of the CTS. To examine the model, a questionnaire including the CTS was administered to 472 middle school students. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the construct of the measurements, and a PLS-SEM analysis was used to validate the structural relationships among the factors. The results confirmed that the 19-item CTS has good item reliability, internal consistency, and construct reliability for measuring computational thinking (CT). In the Developmental Model of CT, decomposition and abstraction significantly predict all other three CT dispositions, suggesting that they are the two fundamental factors required for CT development. Moreover, a significant linear prediction path was shown starting from algorithmic thinking, evaluation, until generalization. Thus, a multi-level model was confirmed for the conceptual framework of CT. This model suggests a possible sequence for CT development which may provide a guideline for the teaching objectives of CT for different learning stages in different school levels. Decomposition and abstraction are especially suggested to be emphasized in school curricula before teaching algorithmic thinking or algorithm designs. © The Author(s) 2021.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107215834&amp;doi=10.1177%2f07356331211017794&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6478d9f3708d4e0258bfbb95d3772219</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Held, L.</author><author>Micheloud, C.</author><author>Pawel, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>THE ASSESSMENT OF REPLICATION SUCCESS BASED ON RELATIVE EFFECT SIZE</title><secondary-title>Annals of Applied Statistics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Applied Statistics</full-title></periodical><pages>706-720</pages><volume>16</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1214/21-AOAS1502</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replication studies are increasingly conducted in order to confirm original findings. However, there is no established standard how to assess replication success, and, in practice, many different approaches are used. The pur-pose of this paper is to refine and extend a recently proposed reverse-Bayes approach for the analysis of replication studies. We show how this method is directly related to the relative effect size, the ratio of the replication to the original effect estimate. This perspective leads to a new proposal to re-calibrate the assessment of replication success, the golden level. The recal-ibration ensures that, for borderline significant original studies, replication success can only be achieved if the replication effect estimate is larger than the original one. Conditional power for replication success can then take any desired value if the original study is significant and the replication sample size is large enough. Compared to the standard approach to require statistical significance of both the original and replication study, replication success at the golden level offers uniform gains in project power and controls the type-I error rate if the replication sample size is not smaller than the original one. An application to data from four large replication projects shows that the new approach leads to more appropriate inferences, as it penalizes shrinkage of the replication estimate, compared to the original one, while ensuring that both effect estimates are sufficiently convincing on their own. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2022.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132732350&amp;doi=10.1214%2f21-AOAS1502&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4eea740d557213397c7ff192d2c08b45</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, L.</author><author>Kong, L.</author><author>Walters, R.</author><author>Wong, L.L.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Toward Compositional Generalization in Object-Oriented World Modeling</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</secondary-title></titles><pages>26841-26864</pages><volume>162</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Compositional generalization is a critical ability in learning and decision-making.

Materials and methods. The SARS-CoV-2 virus strains related to the variants of concern (VOC) circulating in the territory of the Russian Federation were used in the research. The strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were deposited in the State Collection of Pathogens of Viral Infections and Rickettsioses at the FBIS SSC VB “Vector” of the Rospotrebnadzor. The experiments were carried out on Vero and Vero E6 cell cultures. The dynamics of infectious virus accumulation was determined by titration of culture fluid samples 24, 48, 72, 96 hours after infection (MOI – from 1 to 0,00001 CPE50/cell). Plaque formation was studied on Vero E6 cell culture under 0.2 % agar coating. Image analysis and plaque size calculation were performed using GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). Results and discussion. The study describes the dynamics of accumulation of infectious virus in the culture fluid depending upon multiplicity of infection for the strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus belonging to different genetic lines. Differences in the morphology of plaques on the monolayer of Vero E6 cell culture under agar coating are shown. SARS-CoV-2 virus strains related to Alfa and Delta VOC demonstrate maximum reproduction rate among the studied strains (infectious titer is higher than 7 lg TCID50/100µl). Omicron VOC forms small plaques under agar coating and at a low multiplicity of infection has a low reproduction rate. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 virus strains belonging to different genetic lines have significant differences in the rate of reproduction on Vero and Vero E6 cell culture. © 2022 Russian Research Anti-Plague Institute.

Several studies indicated that changes in indoor humidity could be one of the key factors explaining this. Objective: The purpose of this study is to quantify the association between relevant epidemiological metrics and humidity in both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 epidemic periods. Methods: The atmospheric dew point temperature serves as a proxy for indoor relative humidity. This study considered the weekly mortality rate in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2019 to determine the correlation between the dew point and the spread of influenza. During influenza epidemic periods in the Netherlands, governmental restrictions were absent; therefore, there is no need to control this confounder. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, governmental restrictions strongly varied over time. To control this effect, periods with a relatively constant governmental intervention level were selected to analyze the reproduction rate. We also examine SARS-CoV-2 deaths in the nursing home setting, where health policy and social factors were less variable. Viral transmissibility was measured by computing the ratio between the estimated daily number of infectious persons in the Netherlands and the lagged mortality figures in the nursing homes. Results: For both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, a significant correlation was found between the dew point temperature and the aforementioned epidemiological metrics. The findings are consistent with the anticipated mechanisms related to droplet evaporation, stability of virus in the indoor environment, and impairment of the natural defenses of the respiratory tract in dry air. Significance: This information is helpful to understand the seasonal pattern of respiratory viruses and motivate further study to what extent it is possible to alter the seasonal pattern by actively intervening in the adverse role of low humidity during fall and winter in temperate regions. Impact: A solid understanding and quantification of the role of humidity on the transmission of respiratory viruses is imperative for epidemiological modeling and the installation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The results of this study indicate that improving the indoor humidity by humidifiers could be a promising technology for reducing the spread of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 during winter and fall in the temperate zone. The identification of this potential should be seen as a strong motivation to invest in further prospective testing of this non-pharmaceutical intervention. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138166020&amp;doi=10.1038%2fs41370-022-00472-3&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3b12e22a28dedd88fc53d5cd73e8ea78</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ulrich, M.</author><author>Niemann, F.</author><author>Grön, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The neural signatures of the psychological construct “flow”: A replication study</title><secondary-title>Neuroimage: Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuroimage: Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>2</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ynirp.2022.100139</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The psychological construct “flow” has received major attention during the last decade by various scientific branches in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. Flow is operationally defined in relation to the boundary conditions of boredom and overload. According to the conditions’ arrangement, two major neural flow effects are of interest, inferred by quadratic trends of neural activation. The inverted U-shaped pattern of neural activation is characterized by greater neural activation during the flow condition relative to boredom and overload, while the U-shaped pattern is the reverse, that is, lower neural activation during flow relative to its boundary conditions. Both effects have repeatedly been reported during the last years and have seen greater scientific resonance, which is why we found it necessary to try to replicate recent findings. A fresh sample of 41 healthy male participants was investigated with BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with our flow paradigm. Electrodermal activation served as read-out of the flow effect on the psychophysiological level. Evidence of replication was quantified in terms of the replication Bayes factor. We observed strong replication evidence for electrodermal activation and decisive evidence of replication for both neural flow effects. Aspects of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula and parietal cortex showed inverted U-shaped activation. U-shaped activation was predominant in aspects of medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, amygdala and along the cingulate cortex (subgenual, middle and posterior). Despite its strong replicability, the flow paradigm has been administered in men-only samples so far. Therefore, present results still await empirical replication in women-only samples. © 2022 The Authors</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142330931&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.ynirp.2022.100139&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=cdc5efd281bce9181ee228e1eafeebec</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zou, J.</author><author>Gopalakrishnan, S.</author><author>Parker, C.C.</author><author>Nicod, J.</author><author>Mott, R.</author><author>Cai, N.</author><author>Lionikas, A.</author><author>Davies, R.W.</author><author>Palmer, A.A.</author><author>Flint, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of independent cohorts of outbred CFW mice reveals novel loci for behavioral and physiological traits and identifies factors determining reproducibility</title><secondary-title>G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/G3JOURNAL/JKAB394</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Combining samples for genetic association is standard practice in human genetic analysis of complex traits, but is rarely undertaken in rodent genetics. Here, using 23 phenotypes and genotypes from two independent laboratories, we obtained a sample size of 3076 commercially available outbred mice and identified 70 loci, more than double the number of loci identified in the component studies. Fine-mapping in the combined sample reduced the number of likely causal variants, with a median reduction in set size of 51%, and indicated novel gene associations, including Pnpo, Ttll6, and GM11545 with bone mineral density, and Psmb9 with weight. However, replication at a nominal threshold of 0.05 between the two component studies was low, with less than one-third of loci identified in one study replicated in the second. In addition to overestimates in the effect size in the discovery sample (Winner’s Curse), we also found that heterogeneity between studies explained the poor replication, but the contribution of these two factors varied among traits. Leveraging these observations, we integrated information about replication rates, study-specific heterogeneity, and Winner’s Curse corrected estimates of power to assign variants to one of four confidence levels. Our approach addresses concerns about reproducibility and demonstrates how to obtain robust results from mapping complex traits in any genome-wide association study. © The Author(s) 2021.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123599850&amp;doi=10.1093%2fG3JOURNAL%2fJKAB394&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=125104b506f95042a35fdf480e12b1bd</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coiera, E.</author><author>Tong, H.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication studies in the clinical decision support literature-frequency, fidelity, and impact</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1815-1825</pages><volume>28</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jamia/ocab049</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: To assess the frequency, fidelity, and impact of replication studies in the clinical decision support system (CDSS) literature. Materials and Methods: a PRISMa-compliant review identified CDSS replications across 28 health and biomedical informatics journals. Included articles were assessed for fidelity to the original study using 5 categories: Identical, Substitutable, In-class, augmented, and Out-of-class; and 7 IMPISCO domains: Investigators (I), Method (M), Population (P), Intervention (I), Setting (S), Comparator (C), and Outcome (O). a fidelity score and heat map were generated using the ratings. Results: From 4063 publications matching search criteria for CDSS research, only 12/4063 (0.3%) were ultimately identified as replications. Six articles replicated but could not reproduce the results of the Han et al (2005) CPOe study showing mortality increase and, over time, changed from truth testing to generalizing this result. Other replications successfully tested variants of CDSS technology (2/12) or validated measurement instruments (4/12). Discussion: a replication rate of 3 in a thousand studies is low even by the low rates in other disciplines. Several new reporting methods were developed for this study, including the IMPISCO framework, fidelity scores, and fidelity heat maps. a reporting structure for clearly identifying replication research is also proposed. Conclusion: There is an urgent need to better characterize which core CDSS principles require replication, identify past replication data, and conduct missing replication studies. attention to replication should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CDSS research and avoiding potentially harmful trial and error technology deployment.  © 2021 The author(s) 2021.

This problem is known in seismology as seismic phase picking. It is challenging to automate the accurate picking of seismic phases to the level of human capabilities. By solving this problem, it would be possible to automate routine processing in real time on any local network. A new machine learning approach was developed to classify seismic phases from local earthquakes. The resulting model is based on spectrograms and utilizes the transformer architecture with a self-attention mechanism and without any convolution blocks. The model is general for various local networks and has only 57 k learning parameters. To assess the generalization property, two new datasets were developed, containing local earthquake data collected from two different regions using a wide variety of seismic instruments. The data were not involved in the training process for any model to estimate the generalization property. The new model exhibits the best classification and computation performance results on its pre-trained weights compared with baseline models from related work. The model code is available online and is ready for day-to-day real-time processing on conventional seismic equipment without graphics processing units. © 2021 by the authors.

This study clarifies relations of depression diagnoses and symptoms with AMPD personality pathology. Method: Two samples (Ns 402 and 601) of outpatients and community-dwelling adults completed four depression (criteria met for major depressive disorder and dysthymia; dysphoria and low well-being scales), ten trait (two scales for each of five domains—negative affectivity, detachment, disinhibition, antagonism, psychoticism), and eight dysfunction (four scales for each of two domains—self- and interpersonal pathology) measures. Diagnoses were made using a semi-structured interview; other measures were self-reports. We quantified cross-sectional relations between depression and personality pathology with correlation and multiple regression analyses. Results: Collectively (median R2; ps &lt; 0.0001), the trait (0.46) and dysfunction (0.50) scales predicted the depression measures strongly, with most predictive power shared (0.41) between traits and dysfunction. However, trait and dysfunction scales altogether predicted depression (median R2 = 0.54) more strongly than either domain alone, ps &lt; 0.0001. Participants with depression diagnoses showed elevations on all nonadaptive trait and personality dysfunction measures, particularly negative temperament/affectivity and self-pathology measures. Limitations: Generalization of findings to other populations (e.g., adolescents), settings (e.g., primary care), and measures (e.g., traditional personality disorder diagnoses) is uncertain. Cross-sectional analyses did not test changes over time or establish causality. Conclusions: The AMPD is highly relevant to depression. Assessment of personality pathology, including both personality dysfunction and maladaptive-range traits, stands to advance understanding of depression in adults. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139332218&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jad.2022.09.146&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=99b022fe6855dff33691a5c1ff02a0d5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Westny, T.</author><author>Frisk, E.</author><author>Olofsson, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vehicle Behavior Prediction and Generalization Using Imbalanced Learning Techniques</title><secondary-title>IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Proceedings, ITSC</secondary-title></titles><pages>2003-2010</pages><volume>2021-September</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564948</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The use of learning-based methods for vehicle behavior prediction is a promising research topic. However, many publicly available data sets suffer from class distribution skews which limits learning performance if not addressed. This paper proposes an interaction-aware prediction model consisting of an LSTM autoencoder and SVM classifier. Additionally, an imbalanced learning technique, the multiclass balancing ensemble is proposed. Evaluations show that the method enhances model performance, resulting in improved classification accuracy. Good generalization properties of learned models are important and therefore a generalization study is done where models are evaluated on unseen traffic data with dissimilar traffic behavior stemming from different road configurations. This is realized by using two distinct highway traffic recordings, the publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I80 data sets. Moreover, methods for encoding structural and static features into the learning process for improved generalization are evaluated. The resulting methods show substantial improvements in classification as well as generalization performance. © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118442722&amp;doi=10.1109%2fITSC48978.2021.9564948&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bc18635593848e0966f15181a970fff7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, X.</author><author>Guo, S.</author><author>Guo, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Personalized Federated Learning with Contextualized Generalization</title><secondary-title>IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence</secondary-title></titles><pages>2241-2247</pages><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The prevalent personalized federated learning (PFL) usually pursues a trade-off between personalization and generalization by maintaining a shared global model to guide the training process of local models. However, the sole global model may easily transfer deviated context knowledge to some local models when multiple latent contexts exist across the local datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel concept called contextualized generalization (CG) to provide each client with fine-grained context knowledge that can better fit the local data distributions and facilitate faster model convergence, based on which we properly design a framework of PFL, dubbed CGPFL. We conduct detailed theoretical analysis, in which the convergence guarantee is presented and O(√K) speedup over most existing methods is granted. To quantitatively study the generalization-personalization trade-off, we introduce the 'generalization error' measure and prove that the proposed CGPFL can achieve a better trade-off than existing solutions. Moreover, our theoretical analysis further inspires a heuristic algorithm to find a near-optimal trade-off in CGPFL. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on test accuracy by a significant margin. © 2022 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

The range of different definitions proposed within NLP/ML not only do not agree with each other, they are also not aligned with standard scientific definitions. This article examines the standard definitions of repeatability and reproducibility provided by the meta-science of metrology, and explores what they imply in terms of how to assess reproducibility, and what adopting them would mean for reproducibility assessment in NLP/ML. It turns out the standard definitions lead directly to a method for assessing reproducibility in quantified terms that renders results from reproduction studies comparable across multiple reproductions of the same original study, as well as reproductions of different original studies. The article considers where this method sits in relation to other aspects of NLP work one might wish to assess in the context of reproducibility. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143200699&amp;doi=10.1162%2fcoli_a_00448&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=97151cdab4d495e65e1115fb31d93bc1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, J.</author><author>Sun, X.</author><author>Lu, J.</author><author>Dou, H.R.</author><author>Lei, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization gradients for fear and disgust in human associative learning</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-021-93544-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Previous research indicates that excessive fear is a critical feature in anxiety disorders; however, recent studies suggest that disgust may also contribute to the etiology and maintenance of some anxiety disorders. It remains unclear if differences exist between these two threat-related emotions in conditioning and generalization. Evaluating different patterns of fear and disgust learning would facilitate a deeper understanding of how anxiety disorders develop. In this study, 32 college students completed threat conditioning tasks, including conditioned stimuli paired with frightening or disgusting images. Fear and disgust were divided into two randomly ordered blocks to examine differences by recording subjective US expectancy ratings and eye movements in the conditioning and generalization process. During conditioning, differing US expectancy ratings (fear vs. disgust) were found only on CS-, which may demonstrated that fear is associated with inferior discrimination learning. During the generalization test, participants exhibited greater US expectancy ratings to fear-related GS1 (generalized stimulus) and GS2 relative to disgust GS1 and GS2. Fear led to longer reaction times than disgust in both phases, and the pupil size and fixation duration for fear stimuli were larger than for disgust stimuli, suggesting that disgust generalization has a steeper gradient than fear generalization. These findings provide preliminary evidence for differences between fear- and disgust-related stimuli in conditioning and generalization, and suggest insights into treatment for anxiety and other fear- or disgust-related disorders. © 2021, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109770677&amp;doi=10.1038%2fs41598-021-93544-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c17527102e139949bfdeb3e957b10761</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sáez-Comet, C.</author><author>Muntada, O.</author><author>Lozano, N.</author><author>Fontdecaba, E.</author><author>Sousa, P.</author><author>Llobet, J.</author><author>Perez-Murano, F.</author><author>Puiggali, J.</author><author>del Valle, L.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Three-level hierarchical micro/nanostructures on biopolymers by injection moulding using low-cost polymeric inlays</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1527-1535</pages><volume>124</volume><number>5-6</number><issue>5-6</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00170-022-10338-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The industrial interest in the patterning of polymeric surfaces at the micro/nanoscale to include new functionalities has considerably increased during the last years. Hierarchical organization of micro/nanometric surface textures yields enhanced functional properties such as hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, antibacterial activity, and optical or chromatic effects to cite some. While high accuracy methods to pattern hierarchical surfaces at the nanoscale have been developed, only some of them have been applied for high volume manufacturing with limited success, mainly because they rely on the use of expensive machinery and moulds or complicated inserts. Therefore, a method using low cost recyclable tooling and process conditions applicable to high-volume manufacturing is currently missing. In this work, a scalable and low-cost method to replicate hierarchical micro/nanostructured surfaces on plastic films is presented, which can be latter used as inlays for injection moulded parts with standard processing conditions. This method is used to demonstrate the feasibility of replicating three level hierarchical micro/nano textured surfaces using recyclable bio-based polymers (of high relevancy in the current plastic pollution context) achieving replication ratios above 90%, comparing the replication results with those obtained in polypropylene. The presence of the micro/nanotextures substantially increases the contact angle of all the polymers tested, yielding values higher than 90° in all the cases. Also, various mechanical properties of the replicated parts for all the polymers injected are characterized one and thirty days after the samples were manufactured, showing fairly constant values. This highlights the validity of the replicated surfaces, regardless of the biopolymers special crystallization characteristics. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143226203&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00170-022-10338-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7e298bb7c0684cfc3e691817daa906ca</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hensel, P.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility and replicability crisis: How management compares to psychology and economics – A systematic review of literature</title><secondary-title>European Management Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Management Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>577-594</pages><volume>39</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.emj.2021.01.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The past decade has been marked by concerns regarding the replicability and reproducibility of published research in the social sciences. Publicized failures to replicate landmark studies, along with high-profile cases of research fraud, have led scholars to reconsider the trustworthiness of both findings and institutionalized research practices. This paper considers two questions: (1) Relative to psychology and economics, what is the state of replication and reproduction research in management? (2) Are the disciplines equally advanced in the use of methods applied to study the replication problem? A systematic literature review identified 67 studies pertinent to these questions. The results indicate that the replication prevalence rate in management studies lies almost exactly between those of psychology and economics, while a high level of variation between management and other business-related disciplines can be noted. Further, similarly to psychology, but unlike economics, the surveys of published replications tend to report high replication success rates for management and other business-related disciplines. However, a comparison with recently obtained results in preregistered multi-study replications in psychology and economics suggests that these rates are almost certainly inflated. Method and data transparency are medium to low, often rendering attempts to reproduce or replicate studies impossible. Finally, the understanding of the replicability problem in management is held back by the underutilization of methods developed in other disciplines. The review also reveals that management, psychology, and economics exhibit strikingly different practices and approaches to replication, despite facing similar incentive structures. Disciplines in which replication and reproduction attempts are rare and which frequently involve authors of the original study in replication attempts lack strong deterrents against questionable research practices; thus, they are less likely to deliver replicable results. © 2021 The Author</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099616011&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.emj.2021.01.002&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2822b47a0cb833266dd92c186f333e40</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, X.</author><author>Ren, Y.</author><author>Wang, Y.</author><author>Wang, J.</author><author>Xiong, Y.</author><author>Wu, G.</author><author>Li, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Color Reproduction Analysis for 3D Printing Based on Photosensitive Resin</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering</secondary-title></titles><pages>54-58</pages><volume>896 LNEE</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-981-19-1673-1_10</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the continuous innovation and development of printing technology, full-color 3D printing has gradually become the development trend of the industry. Although full-color 3D printing has been realized, there is still a lack of technology to accurately evaluate color reproduction for 3D printing objects. In this paper, the common color properties, i.e., color gamut, spectral reflectance and chromaticity were chosen to analyze color reproduction for 3D printing of photosensitive resin and digital printing of inkjet and electrostatic methods. It shows that the color reproduction of 3D printing based on photosensitive resins has a good performance. It is helpful to develop the color management for 3D color printing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128937889&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-1673-1_10&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c236b70064cfe807fa3ff9fb683d1739</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balakirev, N.A.</author><author>Shumilina, N.N.</author><author>Larina, E.E.</author><author>Galatskaya, A.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Peculiarities of breeding work with red foxes obtained as a result of dominant color mutations</title><secondary-title>IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science</secondary-title></titles><volume>848</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/1755-1315/848/1/012205</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The proportion of the silver-black breed population in the fox gene pool by 2019 was 89.3%, the Vyatka ognevka accounted for 9.9%, so only 0.8% remained for the entire colored population. However, it is no secret that the market does not tolerate uniformity. One of the most effective ways to increase sales of any product, including fur products, is to expand the assortment. The fox industry has something to offer the consumer: in the niche of fur farming by the variety of colorful forms with it can be compared only with mink. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the history of "color"fox breeding dates back to the 30s of the last century, at present there is a lack of systematized information in Russian on various aspects of breeding mutant color forms of the fox. This work is devoted to determining the optimal breeding methods for obtaining the maximum number of young foxes of original coloration obtained as a result of dominant mutations. Research objective is to reveal and generalize the peculiarities of breeding work with foxes of snow, white-marbled, platinum and marbled colors. To this end, the following tasks have been set: to analyze the reproduction rates of female and male foxes of the above colors; to compare the results of reproduction depending on age; to identify the most productive type of crossbreeding for the breeding of the foxes presented. The article presents the results of various interbreeding of silver-black, snow, marbled and red foxes. Analysis of mating of animals of different ages has been carried out. The optimal combinations of parental pairs are revealed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116469708&amp;doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f848%2f1%2f012205&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5a633f86efcc4c0c4e6210c19b7062a0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Theis, J.</author><author>Mokhtarian, I.</author><author>Darabi, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Performance Analysis of the Adversarial System Variant Approximation Method to Quantify Process Model Generalization</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing</secondary-title></titles><pages>281-293</pages><volume>433 LNBIP</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-030-98581-3_21</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Process mining algorithms discover a process model from an event log. The resulting process model is supposed to describe all possible event sequences of the underlying system. Generalization is a process model quality dimension of interest. A generalization metric should quantify the extent to which a process model represents the observed event sequences contained in the event log and the unobserved event sequences of the system. Most of the available metrics in the literature cannot properly quantify the generalization of a process model. A recently published method called Adversarial System Variant Approximation leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to approximate the underlying event sequence distribution of a system from an event log. While this method demonstrated performance gains over existing methods in measuring the generalization of process models, its experimental evaluations have been performed under ideal conditions. This paper experimentally investigates the performance of Adversarial System Variant Approximation under non-ideal conditions such as biased and limited event logs. Moreover, experiments are performed to investigate the originally proposed sampling parameter value of the method on its performance to measure the generalization. The results confirm the need to raise awareness about the working conditions of the Adversarial System Variant Approximation method and serve to initiate future research directions. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127670155&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-98581-3_21&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fe7e2922406560f5dbec9938b8f8beb9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, X.</author><author>Ito, M.</author><author>Aoyagi, H.</author><author>Murayama, A.</author><author>Aizaki, H.</author><author>Fukasawa, M.</author><author>Kato, T.</author><author>Wakita, T.</author><author>Suzuki, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development and Use of a Kinetical and Real-Time Monitoring System to Analyze the Replication of Hepatitis C Virus</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>23</volume><number>15</number><issue>15</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms23158711</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In microbiological research, it is important to understand the time course of each step in a pathogen’s lifecycle and changes in the host cell environment induced by infection. This study is the first to develop a real-time monitoring system that kinetically detects luminescence reporter activity over time without sampling cells or culture supernatants for analyzing the virus replication. Subgenomic replicon experiments with hepatitis C virus (HCV) showed that transient translation and genome replication can be detected separately, with the first peak of translation observed at 3–4 h and replication beginning around 20 h after viral RNA introduction into cells. From the bioluminescence data set measured every 30 min (48 measurements per day), the initial rates of translation and replication were calculated, and their capacity levels were expressed as the sums of the measured signals in each process, which correspond to the areas on the kinetics graphs. The comparison of various HuH-7-derived cell lines showed that the bioluminescence profile differs among cell lines, suggesting that both translation and replication capacities potentially influence differences in HCV susceptibility. The effects of RNA mutations within the 5′ UTR of the replicon on viral translation and replication were further analyzed in the system developed, confirming that mutations to the miR-122 binding sites primarily reduce replication activity rather than translation. The newly developed real-time monitoring system should be applied to the studies of various viruses and contribute to the analysis of transitions and progression of each process of their life cycle. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137110573&amp;doi=10.3390%2fijms23158711&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c02e14272eb490a9198fcf378289a8ec</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Myin-Germeys, I.</author><author>Van Aubel, E.</author><author>Vaessen, T.</author><author>Steinhart, H.</author><author>Klippel, A.</author><author>Lafit, G.</author><author>Viechtbauer, W.</author><author>Batink, T.</author><author>Van Winkel, R.</author><author>Van Der Gaag, M.</author><author>Van Amelsvoort, T.</author><author>Marcelis, M.</author><author>Schirmbeck, F.</author><author>De Haan, L.</author><author>Reininghaus, U.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in Daily Life in Early Psychosis: Results from the Multi-Center INTERACT Randomized Controlled Trial</title><secondary-title>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</full-title></periodical><pages>411-423</pages><volume>91</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1159/000522274</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction/Objective: This study aimed to investigate efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in Daily Life (ACT-DL), combining face-to-face therapy with an Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI), in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) for psychotic distress, in comparison to TAU. Methods: Individuals aged 15-65 years with clinically established ultra-high risk or first episode of psychosis were randomly assigned to TAU or ACT-DL+TAU. ACT-DL+TAU consisted of 8 ACT-sessions augmented with an EMI-app. The primary outcome was psychotic distress assessed with the Comprehensive Assessment scale of At Risk Mental State (CAARMS) at post-intervention and 6- and 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were functioning, symptom severity, and momentary psychotic distress. We performed multivariate mixed models according to intent-to-treat principles. Results: Between June 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018, 668 participants were referred, of whom 148 were randomized to ACT-DL+TAU (n = 71) or TAU (n = 77). One hundred and fifteen (78%) provided primary outcome data at least at one follow-up assessment. There was no evidence of greater reduction in the primary outcome measure CAARMS distress in ACT-DL+TAU compared to TAU (χ2(3) = 2.36; p = 0.50). However, out of the tested secondary outcomes, global functioning (χ2(3) = 9.05; p = 0.033), and negative symptoms (χ2(3) = 19.91; p&lt;0.001) improved in ACT-DL+TAU compared to TAU, as did momentary psychotic distress (χ2(3) = 21.56; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: INTERACT did not support a significant effect of ACT-DL over TAU on the primary outcome measure of psychotic distress as assessed with the CAARMS. Although significant improvements were found for some secondary outcome measures, further replication studies are needed to confirm the strength and specificity of these effects.  © 2022 S.

As an alternative to this process-based modelling, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated their ability for prediction in ungauged catchments (PUB) with high efficiency. Catchment characteristics, the number of gauged catchments, and their level of hydroclimatic heterogeneity in the training dataset used for model regionalization can directly affect the model's performance. Here, we study the generalization ability of a DL model to these factors by applying an Encoder-Decoder Long Short-Term Memory neural network for a 6-hour lead-time runoff prediction in 35 mountainous catchments in China. By varying the available number of catchments and model settings with different training datasets, namely local, regional, and PUB models, we evaluated the generalization ability of our model. We found that both quantity (i.e. number of gauged catchments available) and heterogeneity of the training dataset used for the DL model are important for improving model performance in the PUB context, due to a data synergy effect. The assessment of the sensitivity to catchment characteristics showed that the model performance is mainly correlated to the local hydro-climatic conditions; the more arid the region, the more likely it is to have a poor model performance for prediction in ungauged catchments. The results suggest that the regional ED-LSTM model is a promising method to predict streamflow from rainfall inputs in PUB, and outline the need for preparing a representative training dataset. © 2022 The Author(s)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143756530&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jhydrol.2022.128577&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=824259cd046608ba3fed148212bf0377</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Butt, S.I.</author><author>Rasheed, T.</author><author>Pecaric, D.</author><author>Pecaric, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MEASURE THEORETIC GENERALIZATIONS OF JENSEN’S INEQUALITY BY FINK’S IDENTITY</title><secondary-title>Miskolc Mathematical Notes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Miskolc Mathematical Notes</full-title></periodical><pages>131-154</pages><volume>23</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.18514/MMN.2022.3656</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We generalize integral Jensen’s inequality and its converse for real Stieltjes measure utilizing the theory of n−convex function by employing Fink’s identity.

The process of professional training of a future teacher at university inevitably focuses on the development of his multidimensional subjective activity, which is characterized by the ability to choose options for achieving educational results, building life and professional prospects on their basis. In the context of modern scientific research, the concept of “teacher’s personality polysubjectness” is highlighted. An important factor in the development of the future teacher’s personality polysubjectness is the socio-cultural educational environment of university. The purpose of the study was to analyze the influence of the components of the socio-cultural educational environment of the university on the development of the future teacher’s polysubjectness. Methods of theoretical analysis, synthesis, generalization, self-assessment, and questionnaire were used in the work comprehensively. The research sample consisted of 328 1st-5th-year students of the Pedagogical Institute of the Belgorod National Research University majoring in “Pedagogical education”. Data collection was carried out in the 2020-2021 academic year. The reliability of the results was checked by methods of mathematical statistics (nonparametric Mann-Whitney test) using the IBM SPSS Statistics software package. Qualitative analysis of students’ reflexive judgments was also applied in understanding the phenomenon of polysubjectness and the role of university’s educational environment in its development. As a result of empirical research, it has been established that the multidimensional socio-cultural educational environment of the university is a determining developing factor influencing on changes in the structure of the future teacher’s personality polysubjectness. The university’s educational environment has the greatest influence on such components of polysubjectness as the ability to interact, emotional intelligence, situational leadership. © 2022 Moscow Polytechnic University.

However, the persistent pandemic and similar CT manifestations between COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) raise methodological requirements. Methods: A fully automatic pipeline of deep learning is proposed for distinguishing COVID-19 from CAP using CT images. Inspired by the diagnostic process of radiologists, the pipeline comprises four connected modules for lung segmentation, selection of slices with lesions, slice-level prediction, and patient-level prediction. The roles of the first and second modules and the effectiveness of the capsule network for slice-level prediction were investigated. A dataset of 326 CT scans was collected to train and test the pipeline. Another public dataset of 110 patients was used to evaluate the generalization capability. Results: LinkNet exhibited the largest intersection over union (0.967) and Dice coefficient (0.983) for lung segmentation. For the selection of slices with lesions, the capsule network with the ResNet50 block achieved an accuracy of 92.5% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.933. The capsule network using the DenseNet121 block demonstrated better performance for slice-level prediction, with an accuracy of 97.1% and AUC of 0.992. For both datasets, the prediction accuracy of our pipeline was 100% at the patient level. Conclusions: The proposed fully automatic deep learning pipeline of deep learning can distinguish COVID-19 from CAP via CT images rapidly and accurately, thereby accelerating diagnosis and augmenting the performance of radiologists. This pipeline is convenient for use by radiologists and provides explainable predictions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122147599&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.compbiomed.2021.105182&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5eb034e494cce8530e291d60958df2b5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ruan, Z.</author><author>Sun, C.</author><author>Lang, Y.</author><author>Gao, F.</author><author>Guo, R.</author><author>Xu, Q.</author><author>Yu, L.</author><author>Wu, S.</author><author>Lei, T.</author><author>Liu, Y.</author><author>Zhang, M.</author><author>Li, H.</author><author>Tang, Y.</author><author>Gao, T.</author><author>Gao, Y.</author><author>Lu, X.</author><author>Li, Z.</author><author>Chang, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development and Validation of a Nomogram for Predicting Generalization in Patients With Ocular Myasthenia Gravis</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2022.895007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: This study aims to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting 1- and 2-year generalization probabilities in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG). Methods: In total, 501 eligible patients with OMG treated at seven tertiary hospitals in China between January 2015 and May 2019 were included. The primary outcome measure was disease generalization. A nomogram for predicting 1- and 2-year generalization probabilities was constructed using a stepwise Cox regression model. Nomogram performance was quantified using C-indexes and calibration curves. Two-year cumulative generalization rates were analyzed using the Kaplan−Meier method for distinct nomogram-stratified risk groups. The clinical usefulness of the nomogram was evaluated using decision curve analysis (DCA). Result: The eligible patients were randomly divided into a development cohort (n=351, 70%) and a validation cohort (n=150, 30%). The final model included five variables: sex, onset age, repetitive nerve stimulation findings, acetylcholine receptor antibody test results, and thymic status. The model demonstrated good discrimination (C-indexes of 0.733 and 0.788 in the development and validation cohorts, respectively) and calibration, with good agreement between actual and nomogram-estimated generalization probabilities. Kaplan−Meier curves revealed higher 2-year cumulative generalization rates in the high-risk group than that in the low-risk group. DCA demonstrated a higher net benefit of nomogram-assisted decisions compared to treatment of all patients or none. Conclusion: The nomogram model can predict 1- and 2-year generalization probabilities in patients with OMG and stratified these patients into distinct generalization risk groups. The nomogram has potential to aid neurologists in selecting suitable patients for initiating immunotherapy and for enrolment in clinical trials of risk-modifying treatments.

In this systematic review, we aimed to examine i) the feasibility and acceptability of social media interventions targeting physical activity and/or diet for people with NCDs, ii) the effectiveness of improving exercise and diet behaviours, iii) specific design components used to promote user engagement and iv) the effectiveness on other health outcomes. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SPORTDiscus from inception until June 2021. Social media interventions targeting physical activity and/or diet were included. Participants were any age, with a diagnosis of one of the following categories of NCDs; cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or mental illness. Interventions using social media alone or as part of an intervention with other modes of delivery were included. Eligible study designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials, feasibility or pilot studies, or quasi-experimental studies. Results: A total of 2358 publications were identified. After removal of duplicates, 2233 publication titles and abstracts were screened, and 10 publications were eligible, describing 8 individual studies. The study designs included five RCTs and three pilot or feasibility studies, all published between 2016 and 2020. Sample sizes ranged from n = 11 to n = 312. Half of the studies were conducted in the United States of America. Clinical populations included severe mental illness (2 studies), cardiovascular disease (2 studies), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2 studies), cancer (1 study) and Type 2 diabetes (1 study). Facebook (three studies) and WeChat (three studies) were the most used social media platforms. The majority utilised social media to deliver health education and facilitate social support and all studies reported &gt;70% retention. Four of the five included RCTS reported significant improvements in exercise behaviours (e.g., step count, exercise capacity) while diet was only assessed in two studies and results were non-significant. Conclusions: Social media interventions appear to be feasible and acceptable among specific NCD populations and preliminary evidence suggests interventions they may be effective for improving exercise behaviours. The evidence for diet behaviours remains unclear. While overall there is an emerging evidence base, more rigorous evaluation including replication studies are needed to determine the efficacy of social media interventions. © 2022 The Authors</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124210842&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.invent.2022.100497&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=73726737f366b6e126f25255fcc7fafa</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lavelle, J.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>When a Crisis Becomes an Opportunity: The Role of Replications in Making Better Theories</title><secondary-title>British Journal for the Philosophy of Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>British Journal for the Philosophy of Science</full-title></periodical><pages>965-986</pages><volume>73</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/714812</electronic-resource-num><abstract>While it is widely acknowledged that psychology is in the throes of a replication ‘crisis’, rel-atively little attention has been paid to the role theory plays in our evaluation of replications as ‘failed’ or ‘successful’. This paper applies well-known arguments in philosophy of science about the interplay between theory and experiment to a contemporary case study of infants’ understanding of false belief (Onishi and Baillargeon [2005]), and attempts to replicate it. It argues that the lack of consensus about over-arching theories informing both the concepts under study and the methodologies used to track them means that researchers disagree over which experiments constitute replications of the original. The second part of the paper places this specific debate within a broader discussion of the replication crisis as a crisis of ‘theory’, developing work by Muthukrishna and Henrich ([2018]) and Bird ([2018]). Bird argues that the lack of agreed over-arching theories in psychology means that a high rate of replication failure is to be expected; this paper agrees with his diagnosis but challenges his proposal that more replication will resolve the problem. © The British Society for the Philosophy of Science.

SUMMARY ANSWER: In 14 European countries with validated datasets on live birth numbers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, excess mortality was inversely correlated with live birth numbers. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Since March 2020, in order to minimize spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and reducing strain on the health care systems, many national authorities have imposed containments and restricted both indoor and outdoor recreational activities. Historical events, such as electricity blackouts, have repeatedly been shown to exert incremental effects on birth numbers. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We evaluated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the containments on reproduction and birth numbers in 14 European countries with complete and validated datasets, until March 2021. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The national demographic offices of 20 European countries were requested to provide the monthly birth numbers from 2015 to March 2021. Among them, 14 countries provided those data. Taking into account seasonal variations, the live birth numbers were compared with excess mortality at two different time intervals during the pandemic. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: At 9 months after the initiation of containments in many European countries, 11 of 14 European countries (78.5%) experienced a decline in live birth numbers, ranging between-0.5% and-11.4%. The decline in live birth numbers was most pronounced in eight European countries with the highest degree of excess mortality. From January to March 2021, live birth numbers continued to decline in 5 of 8 European countries with high excess mortality, whereas live births started to recover in 8 of 14 countries (57.1%). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The live birth numbers of some key European countries were not available. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The demographic changes linked to the COVID-19 pandemic may add to the overall socio-economic consequences, most particularly in those countries with pre-existing reduced reproduction rates.

This results in uncertainty in numerical model validation, particularly when considering extremes. Herein we assess a time-reversal approach for the accurate numerical replication of experimentally generated wave fields. Fifteen irregular sea states, including steep and breaking cases, are generated in two large laboratories in the UK and replicated numerically using the time-domain nonlinear potential flow code OceanWave3D. Through statistical, temporal, and spatial analysis, the method is demonstrated to be effective at re-creating sea states with a wide range of steepness, bandwidth, and duration, in two very different laboratories. Typical values of the coefficient of determination between experimental and numerical surface elevations, r2, averaged over all measurement locations exceed 0.9 and are significantly larger than the alternative replication approaches assessed. The resulting numerical model outputs, when used as inputs to hydrodynamic models of offshore systems, will provide an improved level of validation, subsequently reducing uncertainty in both hydrodynamic model performance and platform design. The method is also naturally suited to replicating measured ocean data for conditions that can be approximately modelled as two-dimensional. © 2022 The Author(s)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141496014&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.apor.2022.103397&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=53d0b4b43c692ce03f2e61b059f64c2a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Perrone, A.</author><author>Wilson, M.</author><author>Fisch, M.</author><author>Buchanan, B.</author><author>Bebber, M.R.</author><author>Eren, M.I.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human behavior or taphonomy?

They are found broken in high frequencies at these sites, a pattern that has been attributed to use. However, previous experimental and ethnographic research on endscrapers suggests that they are difficult to break. We present a series of replication experiments assessing the amount of force required for endscraper breakage, as well as the amount of force generated during human use. We also analyze which morphometric variable best predicts the breakage force. Our results demonstrate that the force humans can generate is far below the breakage force, which is best predicted by endscraper thickness. Finally, we examine an actual Paleoindian endscraper assemblage, concluding that human use was not the cause for breakage. Taphonomic factors such as plowing, or trampling, are a much better potential explanation for the high breakage frequencies present at Paleoindian sites. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087881039&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs12520-020-01143-w&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dbea615460c40b7236b0f051464720d6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hung, K.</author><author>Fithian, W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Statistical methods for replicability assessment</title><secondary-title>Annals of Applied Statistics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Applied Statistics</full-title></periodical><pages>1063-1087</pages><volume>14</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1214/20-AOAS1336</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Large-scale replication studies like the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (RP:P) provide invaluable systematic data on scientific replicability, but most analyses and interpretations of the data fail to agree on the definition of “replicability” and disentangle the inexorable consequences of known selection bias from competing explanations. We discuss three concrete definitions of replicability based on: (1) whether published findings about the signs of effects are mostly correct, (2) how effective replication studies are in reproducing whatever true effect size was present in the original experiment and (3) whether true effect sizes tend to diminish in replication. We apply techniques from multiple testing and postselection inference to develop new methods that answer these questions while explicitly accounting for selection bias. Our analyses suggest that the RP:P dataset is largely consistent with publication bias due to selection of significant effects.

Some of the controversy can be attributed to imprecise and inadequate specifications of the statistical criteria needed to assess replication and nonreplication. Two types of statistical replication evidence and four types of statistical nonreplication evidence are described. In addition, three types of inconclusive statistical replication evidence are described. An important benefit of a replication study is the ability to combine an effect-size estimate from the original study with an effect-size estimate from the follow-up study to obtain a more precise and generalizable effect-size estimate. The sample size in the follow-up study is an important design consideration, and some methods for determining the follow-up sample size requirements are discussed. R functions are provided that can be used to analyze results from a replication study. R functions to determine the appropriate sample size in the follow-up study also are provided. © The Author(s) 2020.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082138386&amp;doi=10.1177%2f1094428120911088&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=588d47e97b967d8d409769b2c662d75c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mayer, A.R.</author><author>Ling, J.M.</author><author>Dodd, A.B.</author><author>Rannou-Latella, J.G.</author><author>Stephenson, D.D.</author><author>Dodd, R.J.</author><author>Mehos, C.J.</author><author>Patton, D.A.</author><author>Cullen, D.K.</author><author>Johnson, V.E.</author><author>Pabbathi Reddy, S.</author><author>Robertson-Benta, C.R.</author><author>Gigliotti, A.P.</author><author>Meier, T.B.</author><author>Vermillion, M.S.</author><author>Smith, D.H.</author><author>Kinsler, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility and Characterization of Head Kinematics During a Large Animal Acceleration Model of Traumatic Brain Injury</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Neurology</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fneur.2021.658461</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Acceleration parameters have been utilized for the last six decades to investigate pathology in both human and animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI), design safety equipment, and develop injury thresholds. Previous large animal models have quantified acceleration from impulsive loading forces (i.e., machine/object kinematics) rather than directly measuring head kinematics. No study has evaluated the reproducibility of head kinematics in large animal models. Nine (five males) sexually mature Yucatan swine were exposed to head rotation at a targeted peak angular velocity of 250 rad/s in the coronal plane. The results indicated that the measured peak angular velocity of the skull was 51% of the impulsive load, was experienced over 91% longer duration, and was multi- rather than uni-planar. These findings were replicated in a second experiment with a smaller cohort (N = 4). The reproducibility of skull kinematics data was mostly within acceptable ranges based on published industry standards, although the coefficients of variation (8.9% for peak angular velocity or 12.3% for duration) were higher than the impulsive loading parameters produced by the machine (1.1 vs. 2.5%, respectively). Immunohistochemical markers of diffuse axonal injury and blood–brain barrier breach were not associated with variation in either skull or machine kinematics, suggesting that the observed levels of variance in skull kinematics may not be biologically meaningful with the current sample sizes. The findings highlight the reproducibility of a large animal acceleration model of TBI and the importance of direct measurements of skull kinematics to determine the magnitude of angular velocity, refine injury criteria, and determine critical thresholds. © Copyright © 2021 Mayer, Ling, Dodd, Rannou-Latella, Stephenson, Dodd, Mehos, Patton, Cullen, Johnson, Pabbathi Reddy, Robertson-Benta, Gigliotti, Meier, Vermillion, Smith and Kinsler.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108329725&amp;doi=10.3389%2ffneur.2021.658461&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=02f41691873e5d39a2fde2fd4d5a1828</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dechant, M.T.</author><author>Bunker, P.C.</author><author>Hall, N.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stimulus control of odorant concentration: Pilot study of generalization and discrimination of odor concentration in canines</title><secondary-title>Animals</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animals</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>11</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ani11020326</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Despite dogs’ widespread use as detection systems, little is known about how dogs gener-alize to variations of an odorant’s concentration. Further, it is unclear whether dogs can be trained to discriminate between similar concentration variations of an odorant. Four dogs were trained to an odorant (0.01 air dilution of isoamyl acetate) in an air-dilution olfactometer, and we assessed spontaneous generalization to a range of concentrations lower than the training stimulus (General-ization Test 1). Dogs generalized to odors within a 10-fold range of the training odorant. Next, we conducted discrimination training to suppress responses to concentrations lower than a concentration dogs showed initial responding towards in Generalization Test 1 (0.0025 air dilution). Dogs suc-cessfully discriminated between 0.0025 and 0.01, exceeding 90% accuracy. However, when a second generalization test was conducted (Generalization Test 2), responding at the 0.0025 concentration immediately recovered and was no different than in Generalization Test 1. Dogs were then tested in another generalization test (Compound Discrimination and Generalization) in which generalization probes were embedded within discrimination trials, and dogs showed suppression of responding to the 0.0025 concentration and lower concentrations in this preparation. These data suggest dogs show limited spontaneous generalization across odor concentration and that dogs can be trained to discriminate between similar concentrations of the same odorant. Stimulus control, however, may depend on the negative stimulus, suggesting olfactory concentration generalization may depend on relative stimulus control. These results highlight the importance of considering odor concentration as a dimension for generalization in canine olfactory research. © 2021 by the authors.

Comparisons with the studies in the extant literature showed that the psychometric properties of CERIS-A scores in the current study are comparable to those of scores on other instruments in the literature, and suggest that the CERIS-A is a potentially useful instrument for examining ethnic-racial identity attitudes across multiple ethnic-racial subgroups in the United States. © 2020 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095848270&amp;doi=10.1080%2f15283488.2020.1828087&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0199396240fb730506acf0fcbb6d2006</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, P.</author><author>Yang, L.</author><author>Yang, X.</author><author>Li, T.</author><author>Graham, R.I.</author><author>Wu, K.</author><author>Wilson, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel partiti-like viruses are conditional mutualistic symbionts in their normal lepidopteran host, African armyworm, but parasitic in a novel host, Fall armyworm</title><secondary-title>PLoS Pathogens</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS Pathogens</full-title></periodical><volume>16</volume><number>6 June</number><issue>6 June</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.ppat.1008467</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) (e.g. metagenomic and transcriptomic sequencing) have facilitated the discovery of a large number of new insect viruses, but the characterization of these viruses is still in its infancy. Here, we report the discovery, using RNA-seq, of three new partiti-like viruses from African armyworm, Spodoptera exempta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), which are all vertically-transmitted transovarially from mother to offspring with high efficiency. Experimental studies show that the viruses reduce their host’s growth rate and reproduction, but enhance their resistance to a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV). Via microinjection, these partiti-like viruses were transinfected into a novel host, a newly-invasive crop pest in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the Fall armyworm, S. frugiperda. This revealed that in this new host, these viruses appear to be deleterious without any detectable benefit; reducing their new host’s reproductive rate and increasing their susceptibility to NPV. Thus, the partiti-like viruses appear to be conditional mutualistic symbionts in their normal host, S. exempta, but parasitic in the novel host, S. frugiperda. Transcriptome analysis of S. exempta and S. frugiperda infected, or not, with the partiti-like viruses indicates that the viruses may regulate pathways related to immunity and reproduction. These findings suggest a possible pest management strategy via the artificial host-shift of novel viruses discovered by NGS. © 2020 Xu et al.

We examined CPD and NMR in a group of pregnant smokers, a quarter of whom were receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT). Aims and Methods: Pregnant smokers recruited to participate in a placebo-controlled trial of bupropion for smoking cessation provided a blood sample for measurement of NMR. Results: Half (52.4%) of the 124 women with NMR data were African American. OAT-treated women (n = 34, 27.4%; 27 receiving methadone and 7 buprenorphine) were more likely to be white (79% vs. 30%, p &lt; .001) and to have a lower mean PHQ-9 total score (2.91 [SD = 2.83] vs. 4.83 [SD = 3.82], p = .007). OAT-treated women reported smoking more CPD (9.50 [SD = 5.26] vs. 7.20 [SD = 3.65], p = .005) and had higher NMR (0.78 [SD = 0.36] vs. 0.56 [SD = 0.25], p = .001) than the non-OAT-treated group. In a linear regression analysis adjusting for race, depression severity, and CPD, NMR was greater in the OAT group (p = .025), among whom the daily methadone-equivalent dosage correlated with NMR (Spearman's ρ= 0.49, p = .003). Conclusions: Consistent with the findings of Oncken et al. (2019), we found that OAT smokers smoked more and had higher NMR than non-OAT smokers. As higher NMR is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation, the effects on NMR of both pregnancy and OAT could contribute to a lower smoking cessation rate in pregnant smokers receiving chronic opioid therapy. © The Author(s) 2020.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092749630&amp;doi=10.1093%2fNTR%2fNTAA066&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c86c288c08ee75fd1ec76c44bdf522ac</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piccione, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility Report for the Paper: Optimizing DiscreteSimulations of the Spread of HIV-1 to Handle Billions of Cells ona Workstation</title><secondary-title>SIGSIM-PADS 2020 - Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGSIM Conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation</secondary-title></titles><pages>79-81</pages><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/3384441.3396230</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The paper, whose reproducibility is assessed in this report, proposes a methodology aimed at improving the performance of Cellular Automata-based HIV models.

Practically, experimentation in SE became compulsory for sharing evidence on theories or technologies and provide reliable, reproducible and auditable body of knowledge. Although existing literature is discussing SE experiments documentation and quality, we understand there is a lack of formalization on experimentation concepts, especially for emerging research topics as Software Product Lines (SPL), in which specific experimental elements are essential for planning, conducting and disseminating results. Therefore, we propose an ontology for SPL experiments, named OntoExper-SPL. We designed such ontology based on guidelines found in the literature and an extensive systematic mapping study previously performed by our research group. We believe this ontology might contribute to better document essential elements of an SPL experiment, thus promoting experiments repetition, replication, and reproducibility. We evaluated OntoExper-SPL using an ontology supporting tool and performing an empirical study. Results shown OntoExper-SPL is feasible for formalizing SPL experimental concepts.

Nevertheless, sharpness defined in a rigid region with a fixed radius, has a drawback in sensitivity to parameter re-scaling which leaves the loss unaffected, leading to weakening of the connection between sharpness and generalization gap. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive sharpness which is scale-invariant and propose the corresponding generalization bound. We suggest a novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), utilizing the proposed generalization bound. Experimental results in various benchmark datasets show that ASAM contributes to significant improvement of model generalization performance.

The purpose of the research is to search for and justify the tools of maximizing the approximation of centralized public funds to the needs of each consumer of social services in order to meet the spiritual, production and material needs of each individual as a mechanism for reproduction and improvement of its habitat. Achieving the goal is related to the following tasks: 1) revealing the essence of physiocratic approach in economic research; 2) substantiation of mechanisms of activation of social capital in the conditions of united territorial communities. The subject of the study is the theoretical and practical foundations of managing the development of partnerships in the public administration and administration system. A complex of theoretical and empirical research methods was used to solve these problems. Theoretical methods include analysis of socio-economic literature, materials and publications of physiocratic orientation. The empirical approach is based on prognostic methods (expert assessments, generalization of independent characteristics, modeling), observational methods (direct and indirect observation, self-observation), praximetric methods (analysis of products of activity, study and generalization of pedagogical experience), methods of mathematical statistics. The main obstacle in the development of service cooperatives and in the implementation of the basic functions of decentralized communities is the inconsistency of existing legislation with the basic principles of decentralization, that is, the maximum approximation to comprehensive service for each citizen. According to our analytical studies of structural logic and physiocratic thinking in decentralized communities, the social and psychological discussion of the basic life principles of each of the residents of the community has not been sufficiently carried out due to their insufficient involvement in community activities. The promising nature of the development of tribal settlements as a promising model for the development of society allows us to attest to the existence of inclusive governance practices and a participatory approach in the formation of rural territories. Further research prospects are related to the substantiation of the economic-mathematical model of rural development under the pessimistic, optimistic and promising scenario of rural development of Ukraine in case of introduction of American, European and Asian management model. © 2020 Scientific Horizons.

In France, Germany, and Switzerland, D. dipsaci damage in sugar beet varies among specific geographic areas. In this study, the reproduction potential of four geographically distinct D. dipsaci populations was determined using sterile carrot disc cultures. In addition, virulence and pathogenicity were investigated in-vivo using sugar beet. No difference was found in the reproduction potential on carrot discs, as well as penetration rate in sugar beet seedlings. The reproduction rate in sugar beet tissue was significantly affected by the D. dipsaci population used. The population from Seeland (CH) showed the highest number of nematodes per plant at 60 dpi (21,071.8 ± 5340.0), compared to the three other populations contained 3588.6 ± 3858.3, 5136.9 ± 4950.8, and 3579.7 ± 5174.2, respectively. Furthermore, the reproduction rate of D. dipsaci was negatively correlated with fresh biomass of sugar beets at 60 dpi. Based on these results, the D. dipsaci population “Seeland” is suitable for breeding programs to detect resistance in sugar beet. After selecting candidate genotypes/varieties, these should be further evaluated for their field resistance in their targeted growing regions. © 2021, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106701316&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10658-021-02304-w&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=007aa8dbd184d9cfd8b4ece7bbf51d78</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Di Noia, J.</author><author>Gellermann, W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of the spectroscopy-based veggie meter® to objectively assess fruit and vegetable intake in low-income adults</title><secondary-title>Nutrients</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nutrients</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/nu13072270</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reflection spectroscopy is an emerging approach for noninvasively assessing dermal carotenoids as a biomarker of fruit and vegetable (FV) intake. This study sought to profile and identify determinants of scores from a reflection spectroscopy device (the Veggie Meter (VM)® ) among 297 urban, primarily Hispanic low-income adults served by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The repeatability of the scores and bi-and multivariate relationships between VM scores, self-reported FV intake measured by a brief screener, and participant characteristics were examined. The mean VM score was 270 (range 0–695); 3-and 6-month test-retest correlations were positive and strong (r = 0.79 and 0.55, respectively). VM scores were negatively associated with body mass index (BMI; r = −0.22) and were higher among participants of Ecuadorian, Dominican, and Mexican Hispanic origin relative to those of Puerto Rican origin; foreign-vs. US-born participants, breastfeeding vs. non-breastfeeding participants, nonsmokers vs. smokers, and participants who consumed three or more cups of FV/day relative to those who consumed less than three cups of FV/day. Foreign-born nativity, consumption of three or more cups of FV/day, and smaller body size were determinants of increased VM scores. Although replication studies are needed to confirm these findings, investigators working with similar populations are encouraged to use the VM to longitudinally track FV intake and to target determinants of the scores in observational and intervention studies of FV intake as measured by the VM. © 2021 by the authors.

The absolute ranging technology derived from time-frequency characteristics of the optical frequency comb is expected to become the incomparable means of length metrology and distance measurement in the future due to its traceability to time-frequency standard and capability of large scale and high precision. This paper proposes a real-time absolute ranging method with multi-wavelength interferometry referenced to optical frequency comb, which enables multiple continuous-wave lasers to be synchronously calibrated to selected modes of the frequency comb by means of optical phase-locked loop. With synchronous phase measurement and calculation with excess fraction algorithm, absolute distance measurement by multi-wavelength interferometry is ultimately fulfilled. The proposed measurement method can not only retain high resolution and high accuracy of traditional laser interferometry, but also can be traced to a time-frequency reference, which is of metrological significance to high-precision length and distance measurement, especially to the definition of "meter" for physical reproduction. Measured results for ranging experiments have proved that the non-ambiguity range of the four-wavelength interferometer reaches 44.6 mm, and fluctuations of air refractive index cause the non-ambiguity range change with the order of nanometers. Through theoretical analysis, it is pointed out that the non-ambiguity range of the multi-wavelength interferometer in the actual measurement environment is restricted by the calculated error of air refractive index, especially the estimation accuracy and fluctuation degree of the refractive index relationship between wavelengths. And in a good laboratory conditions, the non-ambiguity range of real-time absolute ranging by frequency-comb-calibrated multi-wavelength interferometry can reach several meters or even tens of meters. At the same time, a 2-meter linear displacement comparison has been carried out, the P.V. value of the residual errors for linear fitting is 36.1 nm, and such residual errors match the magnitude of uncertainty of air refractive index calculated by empirical formula, which prove that the multi-wavelength interferometry can perform meter-level absolute ranging. The proposed research can be directly applied to precision manufacturing of large-scale semiconductors up to several meters, and is beneficial to promoting the accuracy of laser ranging for space mission. © 2021 Chinese Physical Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101628106&amp;doi=10.7498%2faps.70.20201225&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=13d5b25cd3cb2276083295153dfa6fb3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Islam, T.</author><author>Roknuzzaman, A.H.M.</author><author>Hassan, K.</author><author>Ullah, M.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temperature impacts on the eggplant shoot and fruit borer Leucinodes orbonalis: a life table approach</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Tropical Insect Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Tropical Insect Science</full-title></periodical><pages>351-360</pages><volume>40</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s42690-019-00086-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The eggplant shoot and fruit borer (ESFB), Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a notorious insect pest that causes havoc across all eggplant cultivation areas in Bangladesh. Remarkably, its relationship with environmental factors such as temperature is not clearly defined. We measured the effects of a range of temperatures (22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 °C) on the population growth parameters of ESFB under laboratory conditions (60 ± 5% relative humidity and 16 L:8 D photoperiod), developing an age-stage, two-sex life table. Results indicate that temperature significantly reduced development times and adult total lifespan and affected ESFB life table parameters (P &lt; 0.05). Specifically, the egg hatching time reduced from 5 days at 22 °C to 3 days at 30 °C, while larval and pupal duration reduced from 12 to 8 days and 10 to 7 days respectively. Thus, the generation time (T) was longer (29 days) at 22 °C and shorter (22 days) at 30 °C; meanwhile, the highest fecundity (61 eggs per female) was recorded at 28 °C and the net reproduction rate (Ro) was higher at 24–30 °C, being (18–24) offspring/individual. Consequently, the ESFB population reared at 28 °C and 30 °C had higher finite rates (λ = 1.15 and 1.14 respectively) and intrinsic rates of natural increase (r = 0.14 and 0.13 respectively), testifying the most suitable temperatures for their growth and reproduction. Our findings contribute to understanding ESFB bionomics and occurrences, and thus, might enhance implemented management strategies, particularly in developing pesticide application schedules. © 2019, African Association of Insect Scientists.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076736377&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs42690-019-00086-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bedbe1c6e45ac5830b4dd6b159614d58</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Funkhouser, C.J.</author><author>Chacko, A.A.</author><author>Correa, K.A.</author><author>Kaiser, A.J.E.</author><author>Shankman, S.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unique longitudinal relationships between symptoms of psychopathology in youth: A cross-lagged panel network analysis in the ABCD study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines</full-title></periodical><pages>184-194</pages><volume>62</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jcpp.13256</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The network theory suggests that psychopathology may reflect causal relationships between individual symptoms. Several studies have examined cross-sectional relationships between individual symptoms in youth. However, these studies cannot address the directionality of the temporal relationships hypothesized by the network theory. Therefore, we estimated the longitudinal relationships between individual internalizing, externalizing, and attention symptoms in youth. Methods: Data from 4,093 youth participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study were used. Symptoms were assessed using the Brief Problem Monitor, which was administered at three time points spaced six months apart. Unique longitudinal relationships between symptoms at T1 and T2 were estimated using cross-lagged panel network modeling. Network replicability was assessed by comparing this network to an identically estimated replication network of symptoms at T2 predicting symptoms at T3. Results: After controlling for all other symptoms and demographic covariates, depressed mood, inattention, and worry at T1 were most predictive of other symptoms at T2. In contrast, threats of violence and destructiveness at T2 were most prospectively predicted by other symptoms at T1. The reciprocal associations between depressed mood and worthlessness were among the strongest bivariate relationships in the network. Comparisons between the original network and the replication network (correlation between edge lists =.61; individual edge replicability = 64%–84%) suggested moderate replicability. Conclusions: Although causal inferences are precluded by the observational design and methodological considerations, these findings demonstrate the directionality of relationships between individual symptoms in youth and highlight depressed mood, inattention, and worry as potential influencers of other symptoms. © 2020 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084414489&amp;doi=10.1111%2fjcpp.13256&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9b52e483df89180dc3279350da947106</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guo, Y.</author><author>Lin, Z.</author><author>Lou, J.-G.</author><author>Zhang, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hierarchical poset decoding for compositional generalization in language</title><secondary-title>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems</secondary-title></titles><volume>2020-December</volume><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>We formalize human language understanding as a structured prediction task where the output is a partially ordered set (poset). Current encoder-decoder architectures do not take the poset structure of semantics into account properly, thus suffering from poor compositional generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical poset decoding paradigm for compositional generalization in language. Intuitively: (1) the proposed paradigm enforces partial permutation invariance in semantics, thus avoiding overfitting to bias ordering information; (2) the hierarchical mechanism allows to capture high-level structures of posets. We evaluate our proposed decoder on Compositional Freebase Questions (CFQ), a large and realistic natural language question answering dataset that is specifically designed to measure compositional generalization.

(2009) devised a questionnaire for measuring children's awareness of stuttering and showed that even very young children were often aware of their stuttering. There has been no replication of studies using Boey et al.'s parent-reported questionnaire. The aim of this study was to test whether using Boey et al.'s seven questions, developed for a Dutch speaking population could be effective for measuring the awareness of stuttering in Japanese children. Methods: Participants were 54 children who stutter (CWS) aged 3–7 years. Parents answered seven questions about their child’s awareness of stuttering according to the questions developed Boey et al. Results: Parental-reported observations of the child responses citing at least one awareness incident were 76%. The percentage of stuttering children with awareness of their own speech difficulties, according to chronological age, were as follows: 70% at age 3 years; 67% at age 4 years; 75% at age 5 years; 81% at age 6 years; and 90% at age 7 years. Conclusions: We found that even at age 3 years, many CWS were already aware of their stuttering. The similarity of the data with the seminal study by Boey et al. suggests that the question-based assessment is reproducible even in a country with a different spoken language. The seven questions in Boey et al. are useful for evaluating whether children's awareness of stuttering could contribute to a clinical decision as well as stuttering severity. © 2020 Japan Pediatric Society</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100993491&amp;doi=10.1111%2fped.14405&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c5f8950d00fc8c4522490b7203da75c9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marimuthu, S.</author><author>Joy, M.</author><author>Malavika, B.</author><author>Nadaraj, A.</author><author>Asirvatham, E.S.</author><author>Jeyaseelan, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling of reproduction number for COVID-19 in India and high incidence states</title><secondary-title>Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health</full-title></periodical><pages>57-61</pages><volume>9</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cegh.2020.06.012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Since the onset of the COVID-19 in China, forecasting and projections of the epidemic based on epidemiological models have been in the centre stage. Researchers have used various models to predict the maximum extent of the number of cases and the time of peak. This yielded varying numbers. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (R) for COVID-19 over time using incident number of cases that are reported by the government. Methods: Exponential Growth method to estimate basic reproduction rate R0, and Time dependent method to calculate the effective reproduction number (dynamic) were used. “R0” package in R software was used to estimate these statistics. Results: The basic reproduction number (R0) for India was estimated at 1.379 (95% CI: 1.375, 1.384). This was 1.450 (1.441, 1.460) for Maharashtra, 1.444 (1.430, 1.460) for Gujarat, 1.297 (1.284, 1.310) for Delhi and 1.405 (1.389, 1.421) for Tamil Nadu. In India, the R at the first week from March 2–8, 2020 was 3.2. It remained around 2 units for three weeks, from March 9–29, 2020. After March 2020, it started declining and reached around 1.3 in the following week suggesting a stabilisation of the transmissibility rate. Conclusion: The study estimated a baseline R0 of 1.379 for India. It also showed that the R was getting stabilised from first week of April (with an average R of 1.29), despite the increase in March. This suggested that in due course there will be a reversal of epidemic. However, these analyses should be revised periodically. © 2020 INDIACLEN.

While plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are known to induce plant defenses, endosymbiotic bacteria hosted by herbivorous insects are often beneficial to the host. Here, we aimed to assess whether PGPR-induced defenses in broad bean plants impact the pea aphid, depending on its genotype and the presence of endosymbionts. We estimated aphid reproduction, quantified defense- and growth-related phytohormones by GC-MS, and measured different plant growth and physiology parameters, after PGPR treatment. In addition, we recorded the feeding behavior of aphids by electropenetrography. We found that the PGPR treatment of broad bean plants reduced the reproduction of one of the pea aphid clones. We highlighted a phenomenon of PGPR-induced plant defense priming, but no noticeable plant growth promotion. The main changes in aphid probing behavior were related to salivation events into phloem sieve elements. We suggest that the endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa played a key role in plant-insect interactions, possibly helping aphids to counteract plant-induced resistance and allowing them to develop normally on PGPR-treated plants. Our results imply that plant- and aphid-associated microorganisms add greater complexity to the outcomes of aphid-plant interactions. © 2020 by the authors.

Sleep spindles are important brain waves associated with sleep protection and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. The present study tested whether sleep spindles are altered in individuals with PTSD and whether the findings are reproducible across nights and subsamples of the study. Methods: Seventy-eight combat-exposed veteran men with (n = 31) and without (n = 47) PTSD completed two consecutive nights of highdensity EEG recordings in a laboratory. We identified slow (10-13 Hz) and fast (13-16 Hz) sleep spindles during N2 and N3 sleep stages and performed topographical analyses of spindle parameters (amplitude, duration, oscillatory frequency, and density) on both nights. To assess reproducibility, we used the first 47 consecutive participants (18 with PTSD) for initial discovery and the remaining 31 participants (13 with PTSD) for replication assessment. Results: In the discovery analysis, compared to non-PTSD participants, PTSD participants exhibited (1) higher slow-spindle oscillatory frequency over the antero-frontal regions on both nights and (2) higher fast-spindle oscillatory frequency over the centro-parietal regions on the second night. The first finding was preserved in the replication analysis. We found no significant group differences in the amplitude, duration, or density of slow or fast spindles. Conclusions: The elevated spindle oscillatory frequency in PTSD may indicate a deficient sensory-gating mechanism responsible for preserving sleep continuity. Our findings, if independently validated, may assist in the development of sleep-focused PTSD diagnostics and interventions.  © Sleep Research Society 2020.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096846605&amp;doi=10.1093%2fsleep%2fzsaa064&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3b157329abe924686abe5f71a1b6581b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guan, S.</author><author>Loew, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of Generalizability of Deep Neural Networks Based on the Complexity of Decision Boundary</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - 19th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, ICMLA 2020</secondary-title></titles><pages>101-106</pages><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICMLA51294.2020.00025</electronic-resource-num><abstract>For supervised learning models, the analysis of generalization ability (generalizability) is vital because the generalizability expresses how well a model will perform on new data. Traditional generalization measures, such as the VC dimension, do not apply to deep neural network (DNN) models. Thus, new theories to explain the generalizability of DNNs are required. In this study, we hypothesize that the DNN with a simpler decision boundary has better generalizability by the law of parsimony (Occam's Razor). We create the decision boundary complexity (DBC) score to define and measure the complexity of decision boundary of DNNs. The idea of the DBC score is to generate data points (called adversarial examples) on or near the decision boundary. Our new approach then measures the complexity of the boundary using the entropy of the eigenvalues of those data. The method works equally well for high-dimensional data. We use training data and the trained model to compute the DBC score. And, the ground truth for a model's generalizability is its test accuracy. Experiments based on the DBC score have verified our hypothesis. The DBC is shown to provide an effective method to measure the complexity of a decision boundary and gives a quantitative measure of the generalizability of DNNs. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102522300&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICMLA51294.2020.00025&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f1e266bb99f51e5248c963ab850428d6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vogels, J.J.</author><author>Verberk, W.C.E.P.</author><author>Kuper, J.T.</author><author>Weijters, M.J.</author><author>Bobbink, R.</author><author>Siepel, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How to Restore Invertebrate Diversity of Degraded Heathlands?

Restoration efforts such as sod-cutting (removal of vegetation, litter and humus layer) often shifted these systems from N to P limitation and have had limited success in restoring the invertebrate community. Possible reasons for this include the unresolved acidification and a change in food plant stoichiometry. Here, we investigate how liming and P addition change food nutritional quality and their consequences for invertebrate performance. Methods: We performed feeding experiments with field crickets (Gryllus campestris), using plant material collected from a full factorial field experiment with liming and P addition. We related female reproduction as measure of individual fitness to elemental ratios of plants fed to the crickets. Results: P addition stimulated cricket daily reproduction and shortened their reproductive period, resulting in no difference in total reproduction. Liming greatly reduced both daily and total reproduction and resulted in more females cannibalizing on their male mates. Females that did so could partly offset the liming induced reduction in reproduction, suggesting dietary deficiency. P-addition improved food quality (lower N:P ratios) while liming led to skewed Mn:Mg and Fe:Mg ratios that compare unfavorably to ratios found in terrestrial invertebrates. Conclusion: Increased plant N:P ratio following sod-cutting constrains the reproductive potential in Gryllus campestris in a non-linear way. Liming reduced nutritional quality, likely by inducing deficiencies in Fe or Mn. Management Implications: High-impact restoration management practices such as sod cutting and liming cause new problems for invertebrates rooted in ecological stoichiometry. Since P-addition only partially offsets these negative effects, we instead advocate the use of less intensive N removal management and weaker buffering agents to reduce soil acidification. Furthermore, a reduction in N emission is paramount as it will remove the need for disruptive interventions. © Copyright © 2021 Vogels, Verberk, Kuper, Weijters, Bobbink and Siepel.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107191397&amp;doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2021.659363&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=50aa984a087bcbc11d568a5483268fb4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hedges, L.V.</author><author>Schauer, J.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The design of replication studies</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Some evaluations conduct only a single replication study while others run several, usually across multiple laboratories. Designing such programs has largely contended with difficult issues about which experimental components are necessary for a set of studies to be considered replications. However, another important consideration is that replication studies be designed to support sufficiently sensitive analyses. For instance, if hypothesis tests are to be conducted about replication, studies should be designed to ensure these tests are well-powered; if not, it can be difficult to determine conclusively if replication attempts succeeded or failed. This paper describes methods for designing ensembles of replication studies to ensure that they are both adequately sensitive and cost-efficient. It describes two potential analyses of replication studies—hypothesis tests and variance component estimation—and approaches to obtaining optimal designs for them. Using these results, it assesses the statistical power, precision of point estimators and optimality of the design used by the Many Labs Project and finds that while it may have been sufficiently powered to detect some larger differences between studies, other designs would have been less costly and/or produced more precise estimates or higher-powered hypothesis tests. © 2021 Royal Statistical Society</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103408073&amp;doi=10.1111%2frssa.12688&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=47362776341c4cfb4be444e11e13555a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hernandez-Pacheco, N.</author><author>Vijverberg, S.J.</author><author>Herrera-Luis, E.</author><author>Li, J.</author><author>Sio, Y.Y.</author><author>Granell, R.</author><author>Corrales, A.</author><author>Maroteau, C.</author><author>Lethem, R.</author><author>Perez-Garcia, J.</author><author>Farzan, N.</author><author>Repnik, K.</author><author>Gorenjak, M.</author><author>Soares, P.</author><author>Karimi, L.</author><author>Schieck, M.</author><author>Pérez-Méndez, L.</author><author>Berce, V.</author><author>Tavendale, R.</author><author>Eng, C.</author><author>Sardon, O.</author><author>Kull, I.</author><author>Mukhopadhyay, S.</author><author>Pirmohamed, M.</author><author>Verhamme, K.M.C.</author><author>Burchard, E.G.</author><author>Kabesch, M.</author><author>Hawcutt, D.B.</author><author>Melén, E.</author><author>Potočnik, U.</author><author>Chew, F.T.</author><author>Tantisira, K.G.</author><author>Turner, S.</author><author>Palmer, C.N.</author><author>Flores, C.</author><author>Pino-Yanes, M.</author><author>Maitland-Van der Zee, A.H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide association study of asthma exacerbations despite inhaled corticosteroid use</title><secondary-title>European Respiratory Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Respiratory Journal</full-title></periodical><volume>57</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1183/13993003.03388-2020</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Rationale: Substantial variability in response to asthma treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has been described among individuals and populations, suggesting the contribution of genetic factors. Nonetheless, only a few genes have been identified to date. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with asthma exacerbations despite ICS use in European children and young adults and to validate the findings in non-Europeans. Moreover, we explored whether a gene-set enrichment analysis could suggest potential novel asthma therapies. Methods: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of asthma exacerbations was tested in 2681 children of European descent treated with ICS from eight studies. Suggestive association signals were followed up for replication in 538 European asthma patients. Further evaluation was performed in 1773 non-Europeans. Variants revealed by published GWAS were assessed for replication. Additionally, gene-set enrichment analysis focused on drugs was performed. Results: 10 independent variants were associated with asthma exacerbations despite ICS treatment in the discovery phase (p≤/5×10−6). Of those, one variant at the CACNA2D3-WNT5A locus was nominally replicated in Europeans (rs67026078; p=0.010), but this was not validated in non-European populations. Five other genes associated with ICS response in previous studies were replicated. Additionally, an enrichment of associations in genes regulated by trichostatin A treatment was found. Conclusions: The intergenic region of CACNA2D3 and WNT5A was revealed as a novel locus for asthma exacerbations despite ICS treatment in European populations. Genes associated were related to trichostatin A, suggesting that this drug could regulate the molecular mechanisms involved in treatment response.

This replication study reexamined the construct and concurrent validity of the Childhood Experiences Survey (CES), an expanded assessment of 10 conventional ACEs and seven novel childhood adversities. The CES was administered to three samples of adults with children in a Midwest state: (1) caregivers whose children were the subject of a screened-in child protective services report (n = 1,087), (2) low-income women who voluntarily enrolled in a home visiting program (n = 659), and (3) a convenience sample from general population (n = 667). The prevalence of childhood adversities and their intercorrelations were assessed. Extending a previous exploratory analysis, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the underlying structure of the CES, and tests of association were performed between the factors and adult mental health outcomes. Results confirmed that all 17 adversities were common and interrelated. For each sample, the 10 conventional ACEs fit a two-factor structure: child maltreatment and household dysfunction. The expanded assessment of 17 adversities fit a four-factor solution: direct victimization/household dysfunction, neglect, poverty, and family separation/loss. All factors were significantly associated (p &lt; .05) with depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms in all three samples. Implications for further measurement development aimed at advancing ACE research are discussed. © 2020</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089265735&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.childyouth.2020.105216&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a39da03d383d022095e7385df5491566</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Touret, F.</author><author>Luciani, L.</author><author>Baronti, C.</author><author>Cochin, M.</author><author>Driouich, J.-S.</author><author>Gilles, M.</author><author>Thirion, L.</author><author>Nougairède, A.</author><author>De Lamballerie, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replicative fitness of a sars-cov-2 20i/501y.V1 variant from lineage b.1.1.7 in human reconstituted bronchial epithelium</title><secondary-title>mBio</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>mBio</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/mBio.00850-21</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Since its emergence in 2019, circulating populations of the new coronavirus (CoV) continuously acquired genetic diversity. At the end of 2020, a variant named 20I/501Y.V1 (lineage B.1.1.7) emerged and replaced other circulating strains in several regions. This phenomenon has been poorly associated with biological evidence that this variant and the original strain exhibit different phenotypic characteristics. Here, we analyze the replication ability of this new variant in different cellular models using for comparison an ancestral D614G European strain (lineage B1). Results from comparative replication kinetics experiments in vitro and in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium showed no difference. However, when both viruses were put in competition in human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, the 20I/501Y.V1 variant outcompeted the ancestral strain. All together, these findings demonstrate that this new variant replicates more efficiently and may contribute to a better understanding of the progressive replacement of circulating strains by the severe acute respiratory CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) 20I/501Y.V1 variant. IMPORTANCE The emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants raised numerous questions concerning the future course of the pandemic. We are currently observing a replacement of the circulating viruses by the variant from the United Kingdom known as 20I/501Y.V1, from the B.1.1.7 lineage, but there is little biological evidence that this new variant exhibits a different phenotype. In the present study, we used different cellular models to assess the replication ability of the 20I/501Y.V1 variant. Our results showed that this variant replicates more efficiently in human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, which may explain why it spreads so rapidly in human populations. © 2021 Touret et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114377944&amp;doi=10.1128%2fmBio.00850-21&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c3b89a0d23234cf27701834e772cd3b4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tazi, H.</author><author>Hamza, M.A.</author><author>Hallouti, A.</author><author>Benjlil, H.</author><author>Idhmida, A.</author><author>Furze, J.N.</author><author>Paulitz, T.C.</author><author>Mayad, E.H.</author><author>Boubaker, H.</author><author>El Mousadik, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biocontrol potential of nematophagous fungi against Meloidogyne spp. infecting tomato</title><secondary-title>Organic Agriculture</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Organic Agriculture</full-title></periodical><pages>63-71</pages><volume>11</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s13165-020-00325-z</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Root-knot nematodes are the most economically damaging group of plant parasitic nematodes. Intensive agriculture on sandy soil of Moroccan agroecosystems results in a prevalence and wide distribution of Meloidogyne spp., limiting both conventional and organic fruit and vegetable production. The aim of this study is to assess the nematicidal potential of twelve local isolates of nematophagous fungi in organic tomato production in laboratory and greenhouse conditions. Fungal isolates were of seven genera: Paecilomyces, Purpureocillium, Trichoderma, Fusarium, Talaromyces, Arthrobotrys, Dreschslerella, and Monacrosporium. In vitro assays screened the isolates for their ability to immobilize Meloidogyne javanica juveniles using 96-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 106 spores.ml−1. The same isolates were tested for their potential to reduce M. javanica populations and galling on tomato roots in pot experiments with infested soil, applied upon transplantation at 107 spores.ml−1. Average mortality rate of second-stage juveniles of Meloidogyne spp. in vitro ranged from 11 to 42%, with a maximal range of 64 to 73% mortality. The highest rates of mortality were recorded after 72 h using Purpureocillium lilacinum and Arthrobotrys oligospora. In pot experimentation, the reproduction rate of root-knot nematodes ranged from 176 to 5920% with the gall index varying from 2.7 to 4.9 in treated pots. This study identified Paecilomyces and Arthrobotrys direct nematicidal effect against Meloidogyne spp., in laboratory conditions. To achieve successful control, further studies should be conducted to identify the optimal range of environmental factor practices which lead to the enhancement of biocontrol activity of these NF in the field. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091276738&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs13165-020-00325-z&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2842ed471b7083bad11cc974098e1e2f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bao, Z.</author><author>Zong, C.</author><author>Chen, K.</author><author>Lv, N.</author><author>Yuan, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chromatographic purification of Ca and Mg from biological and geological samples for isotope analysis by MC-ICP-MS</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Mass Spectrometry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Mass Spectrometry</full-title></periodical><volume>448</volume><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ijms.2019.116268</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study presented a chemical protocol for purification of calcium and magnesium from a single aliquot of biological and geological samples. The separation protocol was based on a two-step cation exchange chromatography using DGA resin and AG50W-X12 (200–400 mesh) resin. Calcium fraction was first collected using 0.25 mL of DGA resin, and Mg fraction was then collected using 0.5 mL of AG50W-X12 cation exchange resin. For Ca isotope analysis, the effect of acidity and concentration mismatch as well as the matrix effect were rigorously evaluated using the Neptune Plus MC-ICP-MS with a wet-plasma mode. Based on repeated measurements on BHVO-2 and NIST SRM 1400, the long-term reproducibility was evaluated at 0.08‰ (2SD) for δ44/42Ca915a. The δ26Mg ratios of the analyzed reference materials varied from −1.22‰ to 0.03‰ with the external precision better than 0.11‰ (2SD). The robustness of the protocol has been validated by replicated analyses of biological and geological standards. Calcium and magnesium isotopic ratios of all reference materials measured in this study agreed well with previous data within uncertainties. Therefore, the proposed method can be used for simultaneous determination of Ca and Mg isotopic ratios from a single aliquot of biological and geological samples. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075737869&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.ijms.2019.116268&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=705156e6b1394c8d8778f475eee1a312</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nicolau, M.</author><author>Agapitos, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Choosing function sets with better generalisation performance for symbolic regression models</title><secondary-title>Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines</full-title></periodical><pages>73-100</pages><volume>22</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10710-020-09391-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Supervised learning by means of Genetic Programming (GP) aims at the evolutionary synthesis of a model that achieves a balance between approximating the target function on the training data and generalising on new data. The model space searched by the Evolutionary Algorithm is populated by compositions of primitive functions defined in a function set. Since the target function is unknown, the choice of function set’s constituent elements is primarily guided by the makeup of function sets traditionally used in the GP literature. Our work builds upon previous research of the effects of protected arithmetic operators (i.e. division, logarithm, power) on the output value of an evolved model for input data points not encountered during training. The scope is to benchmark the approximation/generalisation of models evolved using different function set choices across a range of 43 symbolic regression problems. The salient outcomes are as follows. Firstly, Koza’s protected operators of division and exponentiation have a detrimental effect on generalisation, and should therefore be avoided. This result is invariant of the use of moderately sized validation sets for model selection. Secondly, the performance of the recently introduced analytic quotient operator is comparable to that of the sinusoidal operator on average, with their combination being advantageous to both approximation and generalisation. These findings are consistent across two different system implementations, those of standard expression-tree GP and linear Grammatical Evolution. We highlight that this study employed very large test sets, which create confidence when benchmarking the effect of different combinations of primitive functions on model generalisation. Our aim is to encourage GP researchers and practitioners to use similar stringent means of assessing generalisation of evolved models where possible, and also to avoid certain primitive functions that are known to be inappropriate. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084697671&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10710-020-09391-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1572b286d9709a8269c1d9b1f98216ad</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lazarov, A.</author><author>Basel, D.</author><author>Dolan, S.</author><author>Dillon, D.G.</author><author>Pizzagalli, D.A.</author><author>Schneier, F.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increased attention allocation to socially threatening faces in social anxiety disorder: A replication study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Affective Disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Affective Disorders</full-title></periodical><pages>169-177</pages><volume>290</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.063</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Threat-related attention bias has been implicated in the etiology and maintenance of social anxiety disorder (SAD), with attentional research increasingly using eye-tracking methodology to overcome the poor psychometric properties of response-time-based tasks and measures. Yet, extant eye-tracking research in social anxiety has mostly failed to report on psychometrics and attempts to replicate past results are rare. Therefore, we attempted to replicate a previously published eye-tracking study of gaze patterns in socially anxious and nonanxious participants as they viewed social threatening and neutral faces, while also exploring the psychometric properties of the attentional measures used. Methods: Gaze was monitored as participants freely viewed 60 different matrices comprised of eight socially-threatening and eight neutral faces, presented for 6000 ms each. Gaze patterns directed at threat and neutral areas of interest (AOIs) were compared by group. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were also evaluated. Results: Relative to healthy controls, socially anxious patients dwelled significantly longer on threat faces, replicating prior findings with the same task. Internal consistency of total dwell time on threat and neutral AOIs was high, and two-week test-retest reliability was acceptable. Limitations: Test-retest reliability was only examined for the control group, which had a small sample size. Conclusion: Increased dwell time on socially threatening stimuli is a reliable, stable, and generalizable measure of attentional bias in adults with social anxiety. © 2021</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105891570&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jad.2021.04.063&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=314e6dddb59532c8a7f450df14649c58</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schauer, J.M.</author><author>Hedges, L.V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing heterogeneity and power in replications of psychological experiments</title><secondary-title>Psychological Bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychological Bulletin</full-title></periodical><pages>701-719</pages><volume>146</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1037/bul0000232</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this study, we reanalyze recent empirical research on replication from a meta-analytic perspective. We argue that there are different ways to define "replication failure," and that analyses can focus on exploring variation among replication studies or assess whether their results contradict the findings of the original study. We apply this framework to a set of psychological findings that have been replicated and assess the sensitivity of these analyses. We find that tests for replication that involve only a single replication study are almost always severely underpowered. Among the 40 findings for which ensembles of multisite direct replications were conducted, we find that between 11 and 17 (28% to 43%) ensembles produced heterogeneous effects, depending on how replication is defined. This heterogeneity could not be completely explained by moderators documented by replication research programs. We also find that these ensembles were not always well-powered to detect potentially meaningful values of heterogeneity. Finally, we identify several discrepancies between the results of original studies and the distribution of effects found by multisite replications but note that these analyses also have low power. We conclude by arguing that efforts to assess replication would benefit from further methodological work on designing replication studies to ensure analyses are sufficiently sensitive. © 2020 American Psychological Association.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084647893&amp;doi=10.1037%2fbul0000232&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8f34c7873f87d4eba876c1f29961e35c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rustamov, F.</author><author>Kim, J.</author><author>Yu, J.</author><author>Kim, H.</author><author>Yun, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bugminer: Mining the hard-to-reach software vulnerabilities through the target-oriented hybrid fuzzer</title><secondary-title>Electronics (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Electronics (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><pages>1-22</pages><volume>10</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/electronics10010062</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Greybox Fuzzing is the most reliable and essentially powerful technique for automated software testing. Notwithstanding, a majority of greybox fuzzers are not effective in directed fuzzing, for example, towards complicated patches, as well as towards suspicious and critical sites. To overcome these limitations of greybox fuzzers, Directed Greybox Fuzzing (DGF) approaches were recently proposed. Current DGFs are powerful and efficient approaches that can compete with Coverage-Based Fuzzers. Nevertheless, DGFs neglect to accomplish stability between usefulness and proficiency, and random mutations make it hard to handle complex paths. To alleviate this problem, we propose an innovative methodology, a target-oriented hybrid fuzzing tool that utilizes a fuzzer and dynamic symbolic execution (also referred to as a concolic execution) engine. Our proposed method aims to generate inputs that can quickly reach the target sites in each sequence and trigger potential hard-to-reach vulnerabilities in the program binary. Specifically, to dive deep into the target binary, we designed a proposed technique named BugMiner, and to demonstrate the capability of our implementation, we evaluated it comprehensively on bug hunting and crash reproduction. Evaluation results showed that our proposed implementation could not only trigger hard-to-reach bugs 3.1, 4.3, 2.9, 2.0, 1.8, and 1.9 times faster than Hawkeye, AFLGo, AFL, AFLFast, QSYM, and ParmeSan respectively but also scale to several real-world programs. © 2020 by the authors.

During situations of stress, GCs also help in coping with stress by diverting energy away from processes such as growth and reproduction. Hence, studying annual and seasonal changes in GCs of wild populations can help in understanding their role in stress management and reproduction. The quantification of GCs in wild animals involves capturing, handling and restraining, which could be stressful. Moreover, different species may exhibit differential sensitivity to different stressors. Hence, determining species-specific sensitivities and responses to different stressors may help in developing effective conservation measures. In this context, we studied the annual and seasonal variations in corticosterone metabolites of the Bombay night frog, Nyctibatrachus humayuni. In addition, the effects of handling, marking and short-term captivity (24 h) on corticosterone metabolite levels of N. humayuni were determined. Our results show that urinary corticosterone metabolites (UCM) varied significantly annually and between the sexes; in males, the levels were highest during the breeding season, whilst in females, the levels were highest just before the breeding season. Interestingly, UCM levels of both the sexes were not affected by tagging with visual implant elastomer (VIE), and by short-term captivity, suggesting that these manipulations were not stressful in terms of corticosterone responses. © 2020, British Herpetological Society.

The confidence scores will provide a quantitative assessment of how likely a claim will hold up in an independent replication. To create the scores, we follow earlier approaches and use prediction markets and surveys to forecast replication outcomes. Based on an initial set of forecasts for the overall replication rate in SCORE and its dependence on the academic discipline and the time of publication, we show that participants expect replication rates to increase over time. Moreover, they expect replication rates to differ between fields, with the highest replication rate in economics (average survey response 58%), and the lowest in psychology and in education (average survey response of 42% for both fields).

The goal of the current study was to conduct direct replications within a multisite AUD-randomized controlled trial and to test a range of replication metrics. Method: We used data from a large AUD clinical trial (Project Matching Alcoholism Treatments and Client Heterogeneity [Project MATCH], n = 1,726) to simulate direct replication attempts. We examined associations between drinking intensity and negative alcohol-related consequences (Model 1), sex differences in drinking intensity (Model 2), and reductions in drinking following treatment (Model 3). We treated each of the 11 data collection sites as unique studies such that each subsample was treated as an “original” study, and the remaining 10 subsamples were viewed as “replication” studies. Replicability metrics included the consistency of statistical significance, overlapping confidence intervals, and consistency of the direction of the effect. We also tested effect replication and heterogeneity using metaanalysis. Results:We observed between 0% and 100% replicability across the replicability metrics depending on which subsample was treated as the “original” study. Meta-analyses indicated results were more similar across subsamples with no significant heterogeneity for Models 1 and 2. Conclusions: We recommend researchers focus on effect sizes and use meta-analysis to evaluate the level of replicability.We also encourage direct replication attempts and sharing of data and code to facilitate direct replication © 2021.

An analysis of the experience of introducing the blended learning model in the process of learning English by students of a nonlinguistic university in terms of the place of this model in the educational process, the relevance of its use in modern higher education conditions, defining basic criteria and requirements for the participants of the educational process to ensure the effective implementation of blended learning and determining conditions for the successful organization and control of training within the framework of the blended learning model. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results. Methodology. The analysis was carried out in the context of modern methodological concepts and theories: the general theory of education, the theory and methodology of using active teaching methods, the theory and methodology of using distance learning, the methods of using information and communication technologies (ICT) in the educational process, and others. The study is based on a systemic, competencybased, and individual scientific approaches. In the course of studying the experience of introducing the model of blended learning into the educational process, the following methods and techniques were used: study and comparative analysis of the available theoretical and practical literature on the issue under study, methods of deduction and induction, systematization, quantitative analysis of the results, method of expert evaluation, generalization. findings. With the help of testing, the initial abilities of working with interactive technologies of the participants of blended learning (students, teachers) were established, on the basis of which the preparatory and familiarization part of the training course was planned. A qualitative and quantitative analyses of the learning outcomes at the initial, intermediate and final stages, as well as a comparative analysis with the results of students studying according to the standard system (without an online component) were carried out. Basic conditions and criteria for the successful use of the system of blended learning in higher education in our country are highlighted. The MOODLE training platform was tested, its convenience in terms of synchronous and asynchronous communication was investigated, its effectiveness in a blended learning model was confirmed. On the basis of the platform, an educational and methodological complex for teaching English to students in the framework of the blended learning model was developed. originality. It is required to modernize and optimize the educational system of Ukraine through the introduction of new programs, technologies and techniques. The request of modern society for the training of competitive specialists requires a paradigm shift in the education system and its reorientation from the presentation of material to the formation of future specialists' skills and abilities to use and operate this information in modern conditions.

The results of the study will be useful in the subsequent experience of introducing the blended learning model in the process of learning not only foreign languages, but also other academic disciplines, as well as when organizing independent work of students, online communication, conferences and other types of educational activities. © Isakova Ye., Zubenko K.,Paziura N., Olekhnovych V., Ostashchuk V., 2020</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091097114&amp;doi=10.33271%2fnvngu%2f2020-3%2f122&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=17e31abf027210e5bd0b02d88384987c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Páez, E.</author><author>Valkonen, J.K.</author><author>Willmott, K.R.</author><author>Matos-Maraví, P.</author><author>Elias, M.</author><author>Mappes, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hard to catch: Experimental evidence supports evasive mimicry</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>288</volume><number>1946</number><issue>1946</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rspb.2020.3052</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Most research on aposematism has focused on chemically defended prey, but the signalling difficulty of capture remains poorly explored. Similar to classical Batesian and Müllerian mimicry related to distastefulness, such 'evasive aposematism' may also lead to convergence in warning colours, known as evasive mimicry. A prime candidate group for evasive mimicry are Adelpha butterflies, which are agile insects and show remarkable colour pattern convergence. We tested the ability of naive blue tits to learn to avoid and generalize Adelpha wing patterns associated with the difficulty of capture and compared their response to that of birds that learned to associate the same wing patterns with distastefulness. Birds learned to avoid all wing patterns tested and generalized their aversion to other prey to some extent, but learning was faster with evasive prey compared to distasteful prey. Our results on generalization agree with longstanding observations of striking convergence in wing colour patterns among Adelpha species, since, in our experiments, perfect mimics of evasive and distasteful models were always protected during generalization and suffered the lowest attack rate. Moreover, generalization on evasive prey was broader compared to that on distasteful prey. Our results suggest that being hard to catch may deter predators at least as effectively as distastefulness. This study provides empirical evidence for evasive mimicry, a potentially widespread but poorly understood form of morphological convergence driven by predator selection. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Participants included 24,094 K–12 students who completed the mySAEBRS. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) supported the fit of a bifactor model, wherein each item corresponding to both a general factor (i.e., Total Behavior) and one of three narrow factors (i.e., Social Behavior, Academic Behavior, and Emotional Behavior). Such model fit was superior to that of alternative factor structures (i.e., unidimensional, correlated-factor, and higher order). A review of pattern coefficients suggested items were relatively split, with some items loading higher on the general factor and others loading higher on their narrow factor. A series of multigroup CFAs supported the configural and metric invariance of the bifactor model, while yielding less consistent support for scalar/threshold invariance. Omega reliability coefficients indicated each mySAEBRS scale was associated with acceptable internal consistency (&gt;.70). However, when accounting for other factors, only the Total Behavior, Social Behavior, and Emotional Behavior scales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (i.e., &gt;.50).

Methods: Four health economic obesity models simulating an adult UK population were identified, selected for replication, and evaluated using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Reproduction results were compared to original results, focusing on cost-effectiveness outcomes, and the resulting reproduction success was assessed by published criteria. Replication facilitators and hurdles were identified and transferred into related reporting standards. Results: All four case studies were state-transition models simulating costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Comparing original versus reproduction outcomes, the following deviation ranges were observed: costs − 3.9 to 16.1% (mean over all model simulations 3.78%), QALYs − 3.7 to 2.1% (mean − 0.11%), and average cost-utility ratios − 3.0 to 17.9% (mean 4.28%). Applying different published criteria, an overall reproduction success was observed for three of four models. Key replication facilitators were input data tables and model diagrams, while missing standard deviations and missing formulas for equations were considered as key hurdles. Conclusions: This study confirms the feasibility of rebuilding health economic obesity models, but minor to major assumptions were needed to fill reporting gaps. Model replications can help to assess the quality of health economic model documentation and can be used to validate current model reporting practices. Simple changes to actual CHEERS reporting criteria may solve identified replication hurdles. © 2021, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102383711&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs40273-021-01008-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f24ecb26f94919807779d6caf8d0d6df</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forghani, A.</author><author>Kazemi, S.</author><author>Bruce, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Machine-Learning Approach to Generalisation of GIS Data</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Geoinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Geoinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>41-59</pages><volume>17</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.52939/ijg.v17i2.1757</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The automation of map generalisation in this study involves an expert system approach that consists of four main components including knowledge acquisition, an inference engine, knowledge representation and a user interface. The acquired knowledge was then utilised to build a knowledge-based solution: a ‘Generalisation Expert System’ (GES) developed in Java, Python and C programming environments for the delivery of generalised geographical features. Its capabilities are demonstrated in a case study through generalising several line and polyline databases over the study area in Canberra, Australia. The cartographic and GIS software communities will benefit from this study through access to a set of tools, guidelines and protocols that incorporate a standardised cartographic generalisation methodology. The results of the trials utilising GES were analysed: a series of generalisation routines were performed to assess the quality of simplification results for different spatial layers. Cartometric measures such as the total length and number of line or polyline segments were used as indices of generalisation to quantify generalisation performance for the target small scale. For example, there are 101,228 segments in 1:250,000 scale and 9,491 segments in 1:500,000 scale contours over the study area. This requires a reduction in the complexity and the density of elevation data. Changes in the representation of contour features at 1:250,000 and 1:500,000 scales as a result of generalisation were quantified. Outputs from map derivation have been analysed applying the Radical Law, this determines the retained number of objects for a given scale change and the number of objects of the original source map. Testing demonstrated that the implemented algorithms in GES are able to extract characteristic vertices on the original entity lines and polylines (e.g. for roads) while excluding non-characteristic lines and polylines to reduce irrelevant computation. This study has demonstrated reasonable improvements in Vertex Reduction, Classification and Merge, Enhanced Douglas-Peucker and Douglas-Peucker-Peschier algorithms. The test results show that GES generalises line features accurately while still maintaining their geometric relations. Existing generalisation software requires advanced technical skills from users; GES however, has a basic and user friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) which is an advantage to users with basic technical skills and understanding of spatial data management. Changes to geographic parameters should be updated in multi-scale maps and spatial databases in near real-time. GES can be developed as a potential tool for generalising large-scale maps into smaller scales, and creating maps of different themes across a variety of scales. Test results have also demonstrated that the methodology developed improves the efficiency of line and polyline generalisation. This study aims to contribute to generalisation system design and the production of a clear framework for users. Experiments presented in this book can be applied to real world problems such as the generalisation of road networks and area features using GES. Future research should be directed towards developing web mapping platforms with generalisation functionality at varying scales. © Geoinformatics International.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104959905&amp;doi=10.52939%2fijg.v17i2.1757&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=86a425e955dad55aa5762893f9b7001c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hebblewhite, M.</author><author>Whittington, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wolves without borders: Transboundary survival of wolves in Banff National Park over three decades</title><secondary-title>Global Ecology and Conservation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Ecology and Conservation</full-title></periodical><volume>24</volume><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01293</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Large carnivores are important ecological drivers of ecosystem dynamics when they occur at ecologically effective densities. They are also challenging to conserve, especially in transboundary settings such as along borders of parks and protected areas. Here, we tested for effects of transboundary movements on survival of 72 radiocollared gray wolves from 1987 to 2018 in and adjacent to Banff National Park, Canada. We fit Bayesian counting-process survival models to known-fate radiotelemetry data and tested for the influence of intrinsic covariates such as sex and age, time, and movements outside of protected areas on survival of wolves. We also estimated cause-specific mortality. Non-parametric survival was 0.733 (95% CI 0.622–0.816), and the top Bayesian survival model indicated that wolves outside the park had much lower annual survival rates (0.44, 95% BCI = 0.24–0.65) compared to wolves inside the park (0.84, 95% BCI = 0.73–0.91). The cumulative risk of mortality was on average 6.7 times higher (odds ratio 95% BCI = 2.2–21.4) for wolves outside the park, peaking during the winter hunting and trapping seasons. We found weak evidence for declining survival over time, opposite to patterns predicted by density-dependence. Bayesian cause-specific mortality indicated that the top three sources of mortality were trapping (rate = 0.080, 36% of mortality), followed by hunting (0.053, 18%), and highway (0.046, 18%) mortality. Surprisingly, we found no intraspecific mortality, and low dispersal from Banff National Park. This demographic profile is akin to other exploited populations across North America. While we were unable to combine survival rates with reproduction to estimate population trends, the overall mortality rates within our study area are consistent with a stable wolf population. Nonetheless, the long-term stability and ecological effectiveness of wolves likely differed inside and outside of protected areas, which highlights a challenge with managing transboundary carnivores exposed to different management regimes. © 2020 The Author(s)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091961815&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2020.e01293&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=130f85aa1e3ad45f0ccd479e72fb1f5c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tatár-Kis, T.</author><author>Fischer, E.A.J.</author><author>Cazaban, C.</author><author>Walkó-Kovács, E.</author><author>Homonnay, Z.G.</author><author>Velkers, F.C.</author><author>Palya, V.</author><author>Stegeman, J.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A herpesvirus of Turkey-based vector vaccine reduces transmission of newcastle disease virus in commercial broiler chickens with maternally derived antibodies</title><secondary-title>Vaccines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccines</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>8</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/vaccines8040614</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Newcastle Disease is one of the most important infectious poultry diseases worldwide and is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. In several countries, vaccination is applied to prevent and control outbreaks; however, information on the ability of vaccines to reduce transmission of ND virus (NDV) is sparse. Here we quantified the transmission of velogenic NDV among 42-day-old broilers. Chickens were either vaccinated with a single dose of a vector vaccine expressing the F protein (rHVT-ND) at day-old in the presence of maternally derived antibodies or kept unvaccinated. Seeders were challenged 8 h before the co-mingling with the corresponding contacts from the same group. Infection was monitored by daily testing of cloacal and oro-nasal swabs with reverse transcription-real-time PCR and by serology. Vaccinated birds were completely protected against clinical disease and virus excretion was significantly reduced compared to the unvaccinated controls that all died during the experiment. The reproduction ratio, which is the average number of secondary infections caused by an infectious bird, was significantly lower in the vaccinated group (0.82 (95%CI 0.38–1.75)) than in the unvaccinated group (3.2 (95% CI 2.06–4.96)). Results of this study demonstrate the potential of rHVT-ND vaccine in prevention and control of ND outbreaks. © 2020 by the authors.

The substantial resources required by these projects limits the number of studies that can be repeated and consequently the generalizability of the findings. We extend the use of a method from Jager and Leek to estimate the false discovery rate for 94 journals over a 5-year period using p values from over 30,000 abstracts enabling the study of how the false discovery rate varies by journal characteristics. Results: We find that the empirical false discovery rate is higher for cancer versus general medicine journals (p = 9.801E−07, 95% CI: 0.045, 0.097; adjusted mean false discovery rate cancer = 0.264 vs. general medicine = 0.194). We also find that false discovery rate is negatively associated with log journal impact factor. A two-fold decrease in journal impact factor is associated with an average increase of 0.020 in FDR (p = 2.545E−04). Conversely, we find no statistically significant evidence of a higher false discovery rate, on average, for Open Access versus closed access journals (p = 0.320, 95% CI − 0.015, 0.046, adjusted mean false discovery rate Open Access = 0.241 vs. closed access = 0.225). Conclusions: Our results identify areas of research that may need additional scrutiny and support to facilitate replicable science. Given our publicly available R code and data, others can complete a broad assessment of the empirical false discovery rate across other subject areas and characteristics of published research. © 2020, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097389991&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12859-020-03817-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=68cdd02cd2d3ccefae80aa7ba2d35306</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cox, K.H.M.</author><author>White, D.J.</author><author>Pipingas, A.</author><author>Poorun, K.</author><author>Scholey, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Further evidence of benefits to mood and working memory from lipidated curcumin in healthy older people: A 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial replication study</title><secondary-title>Nutrients</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nutrients</full-title></periodical><pages>1-20</pages><volume>12</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/nu12061678</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Curcumin (a flavonoid isolated from turmeric) affects several processes involved in neurocognitive aging. We have previously reported that short term (4-weeks) administration of a highly bioavailable curcumin preparation (Longvida©) improved working memory and reduced fatigue and stress reactivity in a healthy older cohort. The present trial (ACTRN12616000484448) was a partial replication study, evaluating similar effects at 4 and 12-weeks Longvida© supplementation. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups trial was conducted. Eighty participants aged 50–80 years (mean = 68.1, SD = 6.34) were randomised to receive Longvida© (400 mg daily containing 80 mg curcumin) or a matching placebo. Assessment took place at baseline then following 4 and 12 weeks treatment. Outcome measures included cognitive performance, mood and biomarkers. Compared with placebo, curcumin was associated with several significant effects. These included better working memory performance at 12-weeks (Serial Threes, Serial Sevens and performance on a virtual Morris Water Maze), and lower fatigue scores on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) at both 4 and 12-weeks, and of tension, anger, confusion and total mood disturbance at 4-weeks only. The curcumin group had significantly elevated blood glucose. These results confirm that Longvida© improves aspects of mood and working memory in a healthy older cohort. The pattern of results is consistent with improvements in hippocampal function and may hold promise for alleviating cognitive decline in some populations. © 2020 by the authors.

The approach combines a specific reverse Bayes technique with prior-predictive tail probabilities to define replication success. The method gives rise to a quantitative measure for replication success, called the sceptical p-value. The sceptical p-value integrates traditional significance of both the original and the replication study with a comparison of the respective effect sizes. It incorporates the uncertainty of both the original and the replication effect estimates and reduces to the ordinary p-value of the replication study if the uncertainty of the original effect estimate is ignored. The framework proposed can also be used to determine the power or the required replication sample size to achieve replication success. Numerical calculations highlight the difficulty of achieving replication success if the evidence from the original study is only suggestive. An application to data from the Open Science Collaboration project on the replicability of psychological science illustrates the methodology proposed. © 2019 The Authors Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society) Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of the Royal Statistical Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077356155&amp;doi=10.1111%2frssa.12493&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=10d370b1df96b610a3ca37c5695ae6ff</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, C.</author><author>Ramakrishnan, S.</author><author>Laxminarayan, S.</author><author>Dovzhenok, A.</author><author>Cashmere, J.D.</author><author>Germain, A.</author><author>Reifman, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An attempt to identify reproducible high-density EEG markers of PTSD during sleep</title><secondary-title>Sleep</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sleep</full-title></periodical><volume>43</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/sleep/zsz207</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Study Objectives: We examined electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral power to study abnormalities in regional brain activity in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during sleep. We aimed to identify sleep EEG markers of PTSD that were reproducible across nights and subsamples of our study population. Methods: Seventy-eight combat-exposed veteran men with (n = 31) and without (n = 47) PTSD completed two consecutive nights of high-density EEG recordings in a laboratory. We performed spectral-topographical EEG analyses on data from both nights. To assess reproducibility, we used the first 47 consecutive participants (18 with PTSD) for initial discovery and the remaining 31 participants (13 with PTSD) for replication. Results: In the discovery analysis, compared with non-PTSD participants, PTSD participants exhibited (1) reduced delta power (1-4 Hz) in the centro-parietal regions during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and (2) elevated high-frequency power, most prominent in the gamma band (30-40 Hz), in the antero-frontal regions during both NREM and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These findings were consistent across the two study nights, with reproducible trends in the replication analysis. We found no significant group differences in theta power (4-8 Hz) during REM sleep and sigma power (12-15 Hz) during N2 sleep. Conclusions: The reduced centro-parietal NREM delta power, indicating reduced sleep depth, and the elevated antero-frontal NREM and REM gamma powers, indicating heightened central arousal, are potential objective sleep markers of PTSD. If independently validated, these putative EEG markers may offer new targets for the development of sleep-specific PTSD diagnostics and interventions. © 2019 Sleep Research Society 2019.

DNA replication results in an increase in DNA copy number that can be measured by high-throughput sequencing. Here we present a protocol to determine genome replication dynamics using DNA copy-number measurements. Cell populations can be obtained in three variants of the method. First, sort-seq reveals the average replication dynamics across S phase in an unperturbed cell population; FACS is used to isolate replicating and non-replicating subpopulations from asynchronous cells. Second, sync-seq measures absolute replication time at specific points during S phase using a synchronized cell population. Third, marker frequency analysis can be used to reveal the average replication dynamics using copy-number analysis in any proliferating asynchronous cell culture. These approaches have been used to reveal genome replication dynamics in prokaryotes, archaea and a wide range of eukaryotes, including yeasts and mammalian cells. We have found this approach straightforward to apply to other organisms and highlight example studies from across the three domains of life. Here we present a Saccharomyces cerevisiae version of the protocol that can be performed in 7–10 d. It requires basic molecular and cellular biology skills, as well as a basic understanding of Unix and R. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079363170&amp;doi=10.1038%2fs41596-019-0287-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b2d95b6a0cefbae5d11ef206cadc201e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foo, J.N.</author><author>Chew, E.G.Y.</author><author>Chung, S.J.</author><author>Peng, R.</author><author>Blauwendraat, C.</author><author>Nalls, M.A.</author><author>Mok, K.Y.</author><author>Satake, W.</author><author>Toda, T.</author><author>Chao, Y.</author><author>Tan, L.C.S.</author><author>Tandiono, M.</author><author>Lian, M.M.</author><author>Ng, E.Y.</author><author>Prakash, K.-M.</author><author>Au, W.-L.</author><author>Meah, W.-Y.</author><author>Mok, S.Q.</author><author>Annuar, A.A.</author><author>Chan, A.Y.Y.</author><author>Chen, L.</author><author>Chen, Y.</author><author>Jeon, B.S.</author><author>Jiang, L.</author><author>Lim, J.L.</author><author>Lin, J.-J.</author><author>Liu, C.</author><author>Mao, C.</author><author>Mok, V.</author><author>Pei, Z.</author><author>Shang, H.-F.</author><author>Shi, C.-H.</author><author>Song, K.</author><author>Tan, A.H.</author><author>Wu, Y.-R.</author><author>Xu, Y.-M.</author><author>Xu, R.</author><author>Yan, Y.</author><author>Yang, J.</author><author>Zhang, B.</author><author>Koh, W.-P.</author><author>Lim, S.-Y.</author><author>Khor, C.C.</author><author>Liu, J.</author><author>Tan, E.-K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of Risk Loci for Parkinson Disease in Asians and Comparison of Risk between Asians and Europeans: A Genome-Wide Association Study</title><secondary-title>JAMA Neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA Neurology</full-title></periodical><pages>746-754</pages><volume>77</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.0428</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Importance: Large-scale genome-wide association studies in the European population have identified 90 risk variants associated with Parkinson disease (PD); however, there are limited studies in the largest population worldwide (ie, Asian). Objectives: To identify novel genome-wide significant loci for PD in Asian individuals and to compare genetic risk between Asian and European cohorts. Design Setting, and Participants: Genome-wide association data generated from PD cases and controls in an Asian population (ie, Singapore/Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, mainland China, and South Korea) were collected from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, as part of an ongoing study. Results were combined with inverse variance meta-analysis, and replication of top loci in European and Japanese samples was performed. Discovery samples of 31575 individuals passing quality control of 35994 recruited were used, with a greater than 90% participation rate. A replication cohort of 1926361 European-ancestry and 3509 Japanese samples was analyzed. Parkinson disease was diagnosed using UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures: Genotypes of common variants, association with disease status, and polygenic risk scores. Results: Of 31575 samples identified, 6724 PD cases (mean [SD] age, 64.3 [10] years; age at onset, 58.8 [10.6] years; 3472 [53.2%] men) and 24851 controls (age, 59.4 [11.4] years; 11030 [45.0%] men) were analyzed in the discovery study. Eleven genome-wide significant loci were identified; 2 of these loci were novel (SV2C and WBSCR17) and 9 were previously found in Europeans. Replication in European-ancestry and Japanese samples showed robust association for SV2C (rs246814; odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.11-1.21; P = 1.17 × 10-10 in meta-analysis of discovery and replication samples) but showed potential genetic heterogeneity at WBSCR17 (rs9638616; I2=67.1%; P = 3.40 × 10-3 for hetereogeneity). Polygenic risk score models including variants at these 11 loci were associated with a significant improvement in area under the curve over the model based on 78 European loci alone (63.1% vs 60.2%; P = 6.81 × 10-12). Conclusions and Relevance: This study identified 2 apparently novel gene loci and found 9 previously identified European loci to be associated with PD in this large, meta-genome-wide association study in a worldwide population of Asian individuals and reports similarities and differences in genetic risk factors between Asian and European individuals in the risk for PD. These findings may lead to improved stratification of Asian patients and controls based on polygenic risk scores. Our findings have potential academic and clinical importance for risk stratification and precision medicine in Asia.  © 2020 American Medical Association.

studies in psychological science sometimes fail to reproduce prior findings. If these studies use methods that are unfaithful to the original study or ineffective in eliciting the phenomenon of interest, then a failure to replicate may be a failure of the protocol rather than a challenge to the original finding. Formal pre-data-collection peer review by experts may address shortcomings and increase replicability rates. We selected 10 replication studies from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (RP:P; Open Science Collaboration, 2015) for which the original authors had expressed concerns about the replication designs before data collection; only one of these studies had yielded a statistically significant effect (p &lt;.05). Commenters suggested that lack of adherence to expert review and low-powered tests were the reasons that most of these RP:P studies failed to replicate the original effects. We revised the replication protocols and received formal peer review prior to conducting new replication studies. We administered the RP:P and revised protocols in multiple laboratories (median number of laboratories per original study = 6.5, range = 3–9; median total sample = 1,279.5, range = 276–3,512) for high-powered tests of each original finding with both protocols. Overall, following the preregistered analysis plan, we found that the revised protocols produced effect sizes similar to those of the RP:P protocols (Δr =.002 or.014, depending on analytic approach). The median effect size for the revised protocols (r =.05) was similar to that of the RP:P protocols (r =.04) and the original RP:P replications (r =.11), and smaller than that of the original studies (r =.37). Analysis of the cumulative evidence across the original studies and the corresponding three replication attempts provided very precise estimates of the 10 tested effects and indicated that their effect sizes (median r =.07, range =.00–.15) were 78% smaller, on average, than the original effect sizes (median r =.37, range =.19–.50). © The Author(s) 2020.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096661669&amp;doi=10.1177%2f2515245920958687&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=547eb4ed9711dd793100ebf7470f84f4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cruciani, F.</author><author>Moore, S.</author><author>Quigley, B.</author><author>Nugent, C.</author><author>Sani, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Semi-Supervised Detection of Algorithmically Generated Domains using Neural Network-Based Autoencoders</title><secondary-title>CEUR Workshop Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><pages>29-37</pages><volume>3125</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) are typically used by recent botnets to communicate with their command-and-control server, thus exacerbating the complexity of detecting them compared to older botnets using static IP addresses. As such, recent studies have been experimenting with different approaches to detect algorithmically generated domains using a variety of methods, including Deep Learning. This paper presents a Deep Learning approach based on autoencoders as a semi-supervised method requiring only legitimate domains for training. Semi-supervised methods have an advantage over supervised methods in that they require no labelled DGA data. The proposed autoencoder structure is based on a Neural Network (NN) processing the frequency of 2-grams in domain names. The method has been compared with supervised machine learning methods and cross-validated on a second unseen dataset to evaluate the generalization of results. Results confirmed an F-score of 73% on DGA detection outperforming a NN based on letter frequencies and a Random Forest approach based on n-grams scoring 71% and 65% respectively. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128755728&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6ad5608921d83ddcb3bd843cc2bc1cdb</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hearne, L.J.</author><author>Birney, D.P.</author><author>Cocchi, L.</author><author>Mattingley, J.B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Latin Square Task as a Measure of Relational Reasoning:?

Previous work has shown that the LST elicits typical reasoning complexity effects, such that increases in complexity are associated with decrements in task accuracy and increases in response times. Here we modified the LST for use in functional brain imaging experiments, in which presentation durations must be strictly controlled, and assessed its validity and reliability. Modifications included presenting the components within each trial serially, such that the reasoning and response periods were separated. In addition, the inspection time for each LST problem was constrained to five seconds. We replicated previous findings of higher error rates and slower response times with increasing relational complexity and observed relatively large effect sizes (n2 p 0.70, r .50). Moreover, measures of internal consistency and test-retest reliability confirmed the stability of the LST within and across separate testing sessions. Interestingly, we found that limiting the inspection time for individual problems in the LST had little effect on accuracy relative to the unconstrained times used in previous work, a finding that is important for future brain imaging experiments aimed at investigating the neural correlates of relational reasoning. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065620440&amp;doi=10.1027%2f1015-5759%2fa000520&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f46d36b3d12f733a6631dd61531722f6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Avelino, G.</author><author>Desposato, S.</author><author>Mardegan, I.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transparency and replication in Brazilian political science: A first look</title><secondary-title>Dados</secondary-title><short-title>Transparence et réplication dans la science politique brésilienne: Premier regard</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dados</full-title></periodical><volume>64</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/dados.2021.64.3.242</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We provide the first replication study of political science research published in Brazil by attempting to replicate every quantitative article published in five major Brazilian journals between 2012 and 2016.

Our results show that transparency and reproduction are still in a development stage in Brazilian Political Science. Of the 650 articles reviewed, we asked for data to 197 quantitative articles. From those, only 28% agreed to share datasets and computed codes. We were able to attempt a replication for only 14%, and successfully reproduce the results of less than 5%.

A mechanism was designed and implemented to move the platform in and out the wrapped coil, on which the sealed box for substrate/mold was placed. A chamber of 195 mm diameter and 221 mm length was machined. The movable platform, the sealed box with substrate/mold stack, wrapped coil and cooling fan were all implemented in the high pressure chamber. The nine-point thermocouples attached on the mold, thus, a temperature history of the moving induction heating can be obtained and study the influence of the moving path and power on the heating rate and temperature distribution. The micro V-cut structure hot embossing experiment were performed to prove the potential of this moving induction heating and gas-assisted pressuring hot embossing for fast fabrication of microstructure onto polymeric substrates. As a results, replication rates were all above 95% at 200 °C and 5 kgf/cm2 and the cycle time was less than 4 min and the optic measurement shows the replicated V-cut film can enhance the 36.8% illuminance. The experiment results show the manufacturing potential of this apparatus. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070308487&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00542-019-04560-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b0996618dc17e613701f1ac24c0ece30</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McShane, B.B.</author><author>Böckenholt, U.</author><author>Hansen, K.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Average Power: A Cautionary Note</title><secondary-title>Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science</full-title></periodical><pages>185-199</pages><volume>3</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/2515245920902370</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replication is an important contemporary issue in psychological research, and there is great interest in ways of assessing replicability, in particular, retrospectively via prior studies. The average power of a set of prior studies is a quantity that has attracted considerable attention for this purpose, and techniques to estimate this quantity via a meta-analytic approach have recently been proposed. In this article, we have two aims. First, we clarify the nature of average power and its implications for replicability. We explain that average power is not relevant to the replicability of actual prospective replication studies. Instead, it relates to efforts in the history of science to catalogue the power of prior studies. Second, we evaluate the statistical properties of point estimates and interval estimates of average power obtained via the meta-analytic approach. We find that point estimates of average power are too variable and inaccurate for use in application. We also find that the width of interval estimates of average power depends on the corresponding point estimates; consequently, the width of an interval estimate of average power cannot serve as an independent measure of the precision of the point estimate. Our findings resolve a seeming puzzle posed by three estimates of the average power of the power-posing literature obtained via the meta-analytic approach. © The Author(s) 2020.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091901105&amp;doi=10.1177%2f2515245920902370&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d1fc3520e5fd09dbfb29b9c3630e2a9d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martini, A.</author><author>Huysseune, A.</author><author>Witten, P.E.</author><author>Boglione, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plasticity of the skeleton and skeletal deformities in zebrafish (Danio rerio) linked to rearing density</title><secondary-title>Journal of Fish Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Fish Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>971-986</pages><volume>98</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jfb.14272</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The teleost zebrafish (Danio rerio), an established model for human skeletal diseases, is reared under controlled conditions with defined parameters for temperature and photoperiod. Studies aimed at defining the proper rearing density have been performed with regard to behavioural and physiological stress response, sex ratio and reproduction. Studies concerning the effect of rearing density on the skeletal phenotype are lacking. This study analyses the response of the skeleton to different rearing densities and describes the skeletal deformities. Wild-type zebrafish were reared up to 30 dpf (days post-fertilization) in a common environment. From 30 to 90 dpf, animals were reared at three different densities: high density (HD), 32 fish l–1; medium density (MD), 8 fish l–1 and low density (LD), 2 fish l–1. Animals at 30 and 90 dpf were collected and whole-mount stained with Alizarin red S to visualize mineralized tissues. The entire skeleton was analysed for meristic counts and 172 types of deformities. The results showed that the rearing density significantly influenced the specimens’ average standard length, which decreased with the increase in the rearing density. Differences in meristic counts among the three groups were not observed. Rearing density–independent malformations affected the ribs, neural arches and the spines of the abdominal region, as well as vertebrae of the caudal complex. The HD group showed the highest number of deformities per specimen, the highest number of observed types of deformities and, together with the MD group, the highest frequency of specimens affected by severe deformities. In particular, the HD group showed deformities affecting arches, spines and vertebral centra in the caudal region of the vertebral column. This study provides evidence of an effect of the rearing density on the development of different skeletal phenotypes. © 2020 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079783941&amp;doi=10.1111%2fjfb.14272&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4d41d1f31728ea6b83037576ff99d32b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Devanga, S.R.</author><author>Sherrill, M.</author><author>Hengst, J.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The efficacy of collaborative referencing intervention in chronic aphasia: A mixed-methods study</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>407-424</pages><volume>30</volume><number>1s</number><issue>1s</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1044/2020_AJSLP-19-00108</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: The feasibility of a collaborative referencing intervention (CRI) for adults with chronic aphasia has been documented in two descriptive case studies (Devanga, 2014; Hengst et al., 2010, 2008). The current Phase II mixedmethods treatment study replicates the CRI with four additional participants (using interpretive research) and investigates how it impacts a traditional measure, participants’ confrontational naming abilities, outside of game play (using multiple-probe single-case experimental design). Method: Four adults with chronic aphasia participated in the study composed of (a) three preparatory sessions, (b) five baseline sessions, (c) 15 CRI sessions with five treatment probes, and (d) six maintenance sessions. A collaborative confrontation naming (CCN) probe (i.e., dependent variable) was administered in each baseline, treatment probe, and maintenance session. Each CRI session (i.e., independent variable) consisted of a photo-matching game with participant and clinician partner taking alternative turns identifying and matching personally relevant treatment cards. CCN probes were scored using a multidimensional rating scale. Fidelity and social validity were also assessed. Results: Replication of the CRI showed successful and consistent referential learning in all four participant pairs. The multiple-probe analysis of CCN revealed a positive treatment effect on naming in three participants indicating that the CRI was efficacious. High fidelity was maintained throughout the study. Social validity interviews revealed positive outcomes and significant impacts of treatment on the participants’ lives. Conclusion: The CRI demonstrates strong clinical implications for adults with chronic aphasia. Future research exploring the treatment effectiveness and the implementation to a variety of clinical settings is warranted. © 2020 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100537428&amp;doi=10.1044%2f2020_AJSLP-19-00108&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=76a1a8e673ee80e37fef755c1e52d62e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Periñán, M.T.</author><author>Macías-García, D.</author><author>Labrador-Espinosa, M.Á.</author><author>Jesús, S.</author><author>Buiza-Rueda, D.</author><author>Adarmes-Gómez, A.D.</author><author>Muñoz-Delgado, L.</author><author>Gómez-Garre, P.</author><author>Mir, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association of PICALM with Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease</title><secondary-title>Movement Disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Movement Disorders</full-title></periodical><pages>118-123</pages><volume>36</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/mds.28283</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Cognitive impairment is one of the most disabling nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, a genome-wide association study in Alzheimer's disease has identified the PICALM rs3851179 polymorphism as one of the most significant susceptibility genes for Alzheimer's disease after APOE. The aim of this study was to determine the potential role of PICALM and its genetic interaction with APOE in the development of cognitive decline in PD. Methods: A discovery cohort of 712 patients with PD were genotyped for PICALM (rs3851179) and APOE (rs429358 and rs7412) polymorphisms. The association of PICALM and APOE–PICALM genetic interaction with cognitive dysfunction in PD was studied using logistic regression models, and the relationship of PICALM with cognitive decline onset was assessed with Cox regression analysis. PICALM effect was then replicated in an international, independent cohort (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, N = 231). Results: PICALM rs3851179 TT genotype was significantly associated with a decreased risk of cognitive impairment in PD (TT vs. CC + CT, P = 0.041, odds ratio = 0.309). Replication studies further demonstrated its protective effect on cognitive impairment in PD. In addition, the protective effect of the PICALM rs3851179 TT genotype was more pronounced in the APOE ε4 (−) carriers from the discovery cohort (P = 0.037, odds ratio = 0.241), although these results were not replicated in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Conclusions: Our results support the fact that PICALM is associated with cognitive impairment in PD. The understanding of its contribution to cognitive decline in PD could provide new targets for the development of novel therapies. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090589663&amp;doi=10.1002%2fmds.28283&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=08d97e7710cae6d5d55961100438e234</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ribeiro, E.B.</author><author>Castellani, M.A.</author><author>Júnior De Andrade, D.</author><author>Prado, R.M.</author><author>Souza, L.A.S.C.</author><author>Freire, D.S.</author><author>Savi, P.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biological aspects of the two-spotted spider mite on strawberry plants under silicon application</title><secondary-title>Horticultura Brasileira</secondary-title><short-title>Aspectos biológicos do ácaro-rajado em morangueiro sob aplicação de silício</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Horticultura Brasileira</full-title></periodical><pages>5-10</pages><volume>39</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/s0102-0536-20210101</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Silicon is an inducer of plant resistance to arthropod pests, being a promising strategy for integrated management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of silicon on biological, reproductive and population aspects of parental and F1 generations of the two-spotted spider mite on strawberry plants. Potassium silicate, nanosilica and water were applied to the plants. Two-spotted spider mite females were confined to strawberry leaf disks for oviposition and, after hatching, larvae were observed until the emergence of adults. Once adults had been obtained, couples were formed in order to evaluate pre-oviposition, oviposition, longevity and fertility, with an estimated net reproduction rate, intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase and the necessary time for doubling the generation. Silicon prolonged the duration of some immature stages of the mites in parental and F1 generations, did not affect the duration of the whole biological cycle, though. The periods of pre-oviposition, oviposition and longevity of the parental generation and the longevity and oviposition of F1 generation of the two-spotted spider mite were negatively affected by potassium silicate and nanosilica. The population parameters of the parental generation of the mites indicated that nanosilica is able to lead to a long-run decrease of this pest population. © 2021, Sociedade de Olericultura do Brasil.

Addressing this question is fundamental to understanding the genetics of refractive error and has clinical relevance for genotype-based prediction of children at risk for HM and for identification of new therapeutic targets. Objective: To assess whether a common set of genetic variants are associated with susceptibility to HM, LM, and hyperopia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This genetic association study assessed unrelated UK Biobank participants 40 to 69 years of age of European and Asian ancestry. Participants 40 to 69 years of age living in the United Kingdom were recruited from January 1, 2006, to October 31, 2010. Of the total sample of 502682 participants, 117279 (23.3%) underwent an ophthalmic assessment. Data analysis was performed from December 12, 2019, to June 23, 2020. Exposures: Four refractive error groups were defined: HM, -6.00 diopters (D) or less; LM, -3.00 to -1.00 D; hyperopia, +2.00 D or greater; and emmetropia, 0.00 to +1.00 D. Four genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were performed in participants of European ancestry: (1) HM vs emmetropia, (2) LM vs emmetropia, (3) hyperopia vs emmetropia, and (4) LM vs hyperopia. Polygenic risk scores were generated from GWAS summary statistics, yielding 4 sets of polygenic risk scores. Performance was assessed in independent replication samples of European and Asian ancestry. Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds ratios (ORs) of polygenic risk scores in replication samples. Results: A total of 51841 unrelated individuals of European ancestry and 2165 unrelated individuals of Asian ancestry were assigned to a specific refractive error group and included in our analyses. Polygenic risk scores derived from all 4 GWAS analyses were predictive of all categories of refractive error in both European and Asian replication samples. For example, the polygenic risk score derived from the HM vs emmetropia GWAS was predictive in the European sample of HM vs emmetropia (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.41-1.77; P = 1.54 × 10-15) as well as LM vs emmetropia (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.23; P = 8.14 × 10-5), hyperopia vs emmetropia (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.89; P = 4.18 × 10-7), and LM vs hyperopia (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.33-1.59; P = 1.43 × 10-16). Conclusions and Relevance: Genetic risk variants were shared across HM, LM, and hyperopia and across European and Asian samples. Individuals with HM inherited a higher number of variants from among the same set of myopia-predisposing alleles and not different risk alleles compared with individuals with LM. These findings suggest that treatment interventions targeting common genetic risk variants associated with refractive error could be effective against both LM and HM.. © 2021 American Medical Association.

DESIGN: descriptive study of COVID-19 cases. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: a new information system was developed to record COVID-19 cases with positive na-sopharyngeal swab. Patients resident in the area covered by ATS-MI with symptom onset between February and May 2020 were selected. Different epidemic periods were consid-ered based on the timeline of the various regional and national containment measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: case fatality ratios, incidence rates, and reproduction number by epidemic period and sub-area of ATS-MI. RESULTS: a total of 27,017 swab-positive COVID-19 cases were included. Mean age was 65 years and males were 45%. Incidence in the ATS-MI area was 776 per 100,000 popula-tion. The number of deaths was 4,660, the crude case fatality ratio was 17.3%, higher in males (21.2%) than in females (14.0%). The estimated reproduction number registered its peak (3.0) in the early stages of the epidemic and subse-quently decreased. Territorial differences were observed in the epidemic spread, with a higher incidence in the Lodi area. CONCLUSIONS: estimated incidence and case fatality ratios were higher than national estimates for Italy. Each ATS-MI area had different epidemic spread patterns. © 2020, Inferenze Scarl.

Changes in glycosylation patterns are associated with many human diseases and conditions. Understanding the biological determinants of protein glycome provides a basis for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allow to study biology via a hypothesis-free search of loci and genetic variants associated with a trait of interest. Sixteen loci were identified by three previous GWAS of human plasma proteome N-glycosylation. However, the possibility that some of these loci are false positives needs to be eliminated by replication studies, which have been limited so far. Here, we use the largest set of samples so far (4802 individuals) to replicate the previously identified loci. For all but one locus, the expected replication power exceeded 95%. Of the 16 loci reported previously, 15 were replicated in our study. For the remaining locus (near the KREMEN1 gene), the replication power was low, and hence, replication results were inconclusive. The very high replication rate highlights the general robustness of the GWAS findings as well as the high standards adopted by the community that studies genetic regulation of protein glycosylation. The 15 replicated loci present a good target for further functional studies. Among these, eight loci contain genes encoding glycosyltransferases: MGAT5, B3GAT1, FUT8, FUT6, ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, ST3GAL4 and MGAT3. The remaining seven loci offer starting points for further functional follow-up investigation into molecules and mechanisms that regulate human protein N-glycosylation in vivo.  © 2020 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102095032&amp;doi=10.1093%2fglycob%2fcwaa053&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ab2c625f397af63fda5fe5c4f4e4c6b7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hussein, M.</author><author>Toraih, E.</author><author>Elshazli, R.</author><author>Fawzy, M.</author><author>Houghton, A.</author><author>Tatum, D.</author><author>Killackey, M.</author><author>Kandil, E.</author><author>Duchesne, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meta-analysis on Serial Intervals and Reproductive Rates for SARS-CoV-2</title><secondary-title>Annals of Surgery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Surgery</full-title></periodical><pages>416-423</pages><volume>273</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/SLA.0000000000004400</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective:The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze all literature reporting the basic reproductive number (R0), effective reproductive number (Re or Rt), and the serial interval (SI) values of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Summary Background Data:To assess the rate at which an infectious disease can spread in a population, the 2 measures, R0 and Re or Rt, are widely used. One of the parameters which influence the calculations is the SI, the period between symptom onset in an infector and an infectee.Methods:Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct searching up to May 10, 2020, was performed. A continuous random-effect model was applied using the DerSimonian-Laird (inverse variance) method. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed.Results:A total of 39 articles met the eligibility criteria. Our results demonstrated the mean SI was 5.45 days, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4.23 to 6.66. Pooled estimates for reproduction rates was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.69-3.59) for R0 and 3.18 (95% CI: 2.89-3.47) for Rt. Subgroup analysis by geographical region and date of publication revealed variations over both time and geography in calculated R0 and Rt values. As time has progressed, predicted R0 and Rt values had decreased globally.Conclusions:The study findings indicate that one SARS-CoV-2-infected person is likely to infect 3 persons, supporting that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease. As an essential objective metrics implied in risk assessment for this emerging pandemic, monitoring R0 and Re is necessary to indicate the effectiveness or failures of mitigation efforts.  © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

First, the prism array microstructures were processed on tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-8 wt% Co) substrate by low-speed wire electrical discharge machining and used as the mold core. Then, the glass fiber reinforced polypropylene composite (GF/PP) was melted under ultrasonic vibration, and the surface microstructure of the mold core was replicated. The experimental results show that this method can efficiently and accurately manufacture microstructured parts, and the microstructure has a high replication rate up to 95.5%. By replicating the microstructure, the surface contact angle of GF/PP parts increased from 57.1° to 134.9°, and the wettability changed from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity. The mechanical properties test results show that the GF/PP parts fabricated by ultrasonic injection molding had excellent mechanical properties, and the 30% GF/PP parts show the highest tensile strength of 56.9 MPa. This work provides a new option for fabricating fiber reinforced composite parts. © 2021 The Author(s)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105354328&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.matdes.2021.109771&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1b9544a098bb2216bdd3b0386aa389a1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Belz, A.</author><author>Shimorina, A.</author><author>Agarwal, S.</author><author>Reiter, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The ReproGen Shared Task on Reproducibility of Human Evaluations in NLG: Overview and Results</title><secondary-title>INLG 2021 - 14th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><pages>249-258</pages><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The NLP field has recently seen a substantial increase in work related to reproducibility of results, and more generally in recognition of the importance of having shared definitions and practices relating to evaluation. Much of the work on reproducibility has so far focused on metric scores, with reproducibility of human evaluation results receiving far less attention. As part of a research programme designed to develop theory and practice of reproducibility assessment in NLP, we organised the first shared task on reproducibility of human evaluations, ReproGen 2021. This paper describes the shared task in detail, summarises results from each of the reproduction studies submitted, and provides further comparative analysis of the results. Out of nine initial team registrations, we received submissions from four teams. Meta-analysis of the four reproduction studies revealed varying degrees of reproducibility, and allowed very tentative first conclusions about what types of evaluation tend to have better reproducibility. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123312519&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9b68df53eec9fd63c876d3d9f143934c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>French, A.M.</author><author>Devaraj, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication study evaluating SNS continuance in the South Korean context</title><secondary-title>27th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2021</secondary-title></titles><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Social networking influence can be seen on a global scale with Facebook in particular, attracting billions of active users per month.

Kupor, Laurin, and Levav (2015) reported nine studies that all yielded statistically significant results consistent with the hypothesis that they do. We conducted two large-sample Preregistered Direct Replications (N = 1,104) of studies in Kupor et al.’s article (Studies 1a and 1b) and evaluated replicability via (a) statistical significance, (b) a “small-telescopes” approach, (c) Bayes factors (BFs), and (d) meta-analyses pooled across original and replication studies. None of these approaches replicated the original studies’ effects. Combining both original studies and both replications yielded strong evidence in support of the null over a default alternative hypothesis, BF01 = 11.04, meaning that the totality of evidence speaks against the possibility that religious primes increased nonmoral risk taking in these designs. This suggests that support for the “anticipating-divine-protection” hypothesis may be overstated. © The Author(s) 2020.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086849823&amp;doi=10.1177%2f0956797620922477&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7c3842967571ac26ed344cb93891e62a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ko, H.-R.</author><author>Kim, S.-J.</author><author>Lee, J.-K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Control efficacy of brassicaceae cover crops against clover cyst nematode, heterodera trifolii</title><secondary-title>Research in Plant Disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research in Plant Disease</full-title></periodical><pages>116-119</pages><volume>26</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5423/RPD.2020.26.2.109</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To investigate the effects of Brassicaceae cover crops on clover cyst nematode, Heterodera trifolii, 10 cultivars consisting of six of oil radish and four of white mustard were planted in the nematode infected field at Jeongseon city. Two months after planting, the cover crops were plow down and incorporated into the soil using rotavator, decomposed for 1 month, then transplanted kimchi-cabbages. After 70 days, the density of eggs inside of the cyst and the number of females in the soil were examined. As a result, the reproduction rates of eggs in each plots of Adios and Anaconda cultivars, which were 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, were greatly reduced. The number of females in the plots of above two cultivars showed means at 2.5 and 3.5 per 300 cm3 soil, which were lower than those of other plots. In addition, fresh weights of three plants in the two plots, which were 7.67 and 7.35 kg, were significantly higher than that of the control plot. Collectively, these results suggest that the two cultivars of Brassicaceae cover crops, Adios and Anaconda, could be used for reducing the cyst nematode density. © 2020 Storia della Donne.

Methods: A total of 78 combat-exposed veteran men with (n = 31) and without (n = 47) PTSD completed two consecutive laboratory nights of high-density EEG recordings. We computed a measure of synchrony for each EEG channel-pair across three sleep stages (rapid eye movement [REM] and non-REM stages 2 and 3) and six frequency bands. We examined the median synchrony in 9 region-of-interest (ROI) pairs consisting of 6 bilateral brain regions (left and right frontal, central, and parietal regions) for 10 frequency-band and sleep-stage combinations. To assess reproducibility, we used the first 47 consecutive subjects (18 with PTSD) for initial discovery and the remaining 31 subjects (13 with PTSD) for replication. Results: In the discovery analysis, five alpha-band synchrony pairs during non-REM sleep were consistently larger in PTSD subjects compared with controls (effect sizes ranging from 0.52 to 1.44) across consecutive nights: two between the left-frontal and left-parietal ROIs, one between the left-central and left-parietal ROIs, and two across central and parietal bilateral ROIs. These trends were preserved in the replication set. Conclusion: PTSD subjects showed increased alpha-band synchrony during non-REM sleep in the left frontoparietal, left centro-parietal, and inter-parietal brain regions. Importantly, these trends were reproducible across consecutive nights and subpopulations. Thus, these alterations in alpha synchrony may be discriminatory of PTSD. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

How such cross-talker generalization is achieved has remained an open question. In a seminal study, Bradlow &amp; Bent (2008, henceforth BB08) found that exposure to just 5 min of accented speech can elicit improved recognition that generalizes to an unfamiliar talker of the same accent (N = 70 participants). Cross-talker generalization was, however, only observed after exposure to multiple talkers of the accent, not after exposure to a single accented talker. This contrast between single and multitalker exposure has been highly influential beyond research on speech perception, suggesting a critical role of exposure variability in learning and generalization. We assess the replicability of BB08’s findings in two large-scale perception experiments (total N = 640) including 20 unique combinations of exposure and test talkers. Like BB08, we find robust evidence for cross-talker generalization after multitalker exposure. Unlike BB08, we also find evidence for generalization after single-talker exposure. The degree of cross-talker generalization depends on the specific combination of exposure and test talker. This and other recent findings suggest that exposure to cross-talker variability is not necessary for cross-talker generalization. Variability during exposure might affect generalization only indirectly, mediated through the informativeness of exposure about subsequent speech during test: Similarity-based inferences can explain both the original BB08 and the present findings. We present Bayesian data analysis, including Bayesian meta-analyses and replication tests for generalized linear mixed models.

Initially, classifying knowledge as capital was not clear, due to a turbulent process of conceptualisation of the very notion of capital and its form. The discussions on the grounds of theory and practice have led to a broad theory of capital management, also concerning knowledge management. The paper is of theoretical and cognitive character. It bases on analysis, comparison, generalisation and assessment of the management conceptions related to a special type of capital, that is knowledge. The originality of the research described consists in a compact presentation of the conceptions’ evolution of knowledge management in the view of the development of capital theory. The conclusions resulting from the research process conducted are of universal character. They may contribute to further in-depth research on theory, forecasting further development of capital theory towards knowledge management.

Whereas there are some satisfactory answers to the problems of approximation and optimization, much less is known about the theory of generalization. Most existing theoretical works for generalization fail to explain the performance of neural networks in practice. To derive a meaningful bound, we study the generalization error of neural networks for classification problems in terms of data distribution and neural network smoothness. We introduce the cover complexity (CC) to measure the difficulty of learning a data set and the inverse of the modulus of continuity to quantify neural network smoothness. A quantitative bound for expected accuracy/error is derived by considering both the CC and neural network smoothness. Although most of the analysis is general and not specific to neural networks, we validate our theoretical assumptions and results numerically for neural networks by several data sets of images. The numerical results confirm that the expected error of trained networks scaled with the square root of the number of classes has a linear relationship with respect to the CC. We also observe a clear consistency between test loss and neural network smoothness during the training process. In addition, we demonstrate empirically that the neural network smoothness decreases when the network size increases whereas the smoothness is insensitive to training dataset size. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087492247&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.neunet.2020.06.024&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7c2e829c40bd4c1f51475128c6899ecc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Squitti, R.</author><author>Ventriglia, M.</author><author>Simonelli, I.</author><author>Bonvicini, C.</author><author>Costa, A.</author><author>Perini, G.</author><author>Binetti, G.</author><author>Benussi, L.</author><author>Ghidoni, R.</author><author>Koch, G.</author><author>Borroni, B.</author><author>Albanese, A.</author><author>Sensi, S.L.</author><author>Rongioletti, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Copper imbalance in alzheimer’s disease: Meta-analysis of serum, plasma, and brain specimens, and replication study evaluating atp7b gene variants</title><secondary-title>Biomolecules</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomolecules</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/biom11070960</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Evidence indicates that patients with Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) show signs of copper (Cu) dyshomeostasis. This study aimed at evaluating the potential of Cu dysregulation as an AD susceptibility factor. We performed a meta-analysis of 56 studies investigating Cu biomarkers in brain specimens (pooled total of 182 AD and 166 healthy controls, HC) and in serum/plasma (pooled total of 2929 AD and 3547 HC). We also completed a replication study of serum Cu biomarkers in 97 AD patients and 70 HC screened for rs732774 and rs1061472 ATP7B, the gene encoding for the Cu transporter ATPase7B. Our meta-analysis showed decreased Cu in AD brain specimens, increased Cu and nonbound ceruloplasmin (Non-Cp) Cu in serum/plasma samples, and unchanged ceruloplasmin. Serum/plasma Cu excess was associated with a three to fourfold increase in the risk of having AD. Our replication study confirmed meta-analysis results and showed that carriers of the ATP7B AG haplotype were significantly more frequent in the AD group. Overall, our study shows that AD patients fail to maintain a Cu metabolic balance and reveals the presence of a percentage of AD patients carrying ATP7B AG haplotype and presenting Non-Cp Cu excess, which suggest that a subset of AD subjects is prone to Cu imbalance. This AD subtype can be the target of precision medicine-based strategies tackling Cu dysregulation. © 2021 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108693292&amp;doi=10.3390%2fbiom11070960&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f4fe3161f9ba88b00c5cbb9be9c33cc1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bingham, P.</author><author>Wada, M.</author><author>van Andel, M.</author><author>McFadden, A.</author><author>Sanson, R.</author><author>Stevenson, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-Time Standard Analysis of Disease Investigation (SADI)—A Toolbox Approach to Inform Disease Outbreak Response</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2020.563140</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An incursion of an important exotic transboundary animal disease requires a prompt and intensive response. The routine analysis of up-to-date data, as near to real time as possible, is essential for the objective assessment of the patterns of disease spread or effectiveness of control measures and the formulation of alternative control strategies. In this paper, we describe the Standard Analysis of Disease Investigation (SADI), a toolbox for informing disease outbreak response, which was developed as part of New Zealand's biosecurity preparedness. SADI was generically designed on a web-based software platform, Integrated Real-time Information System (IRIS). We demonstrated the use of SADI for a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak scenario in New Zealand. The data standards were set within SADI, accommodating a single relational database that integrated the national livestock population data, outbreak data, and tracing data. We collected a well-researched, standardised set of 16 epidemiologically relevant analyses for informing the FMD outbreak response, including farm response timelines, interactive outbreak/network maps, stratified epidemic curves, estimated dissemination rates, estimated reproduction numbers, and areal attack rates. The analyses were programmed within SADI to automate the process to generate the reports at a regular interval (daily) using the most up-to-date data. Having SADI prepared in advance and the process streamlined for data collection, analysis and reporting would free a wider group of epidemiologists during an actual disease outbreak from solving data inconsistency among response teams, daily “number crunching,” or providing largely retrospective analyses. Instead, the focus could be directed into enhancing data collection strategies, improving data quality, understanding the limitations of the data available, interpreting the set of analyses, and communicating their meaning with response teams, decision makers and public in the context of the epidemic. © Copyright © 2020 Bingham, Wada, van Andel, McFadden, Sanson and Stevenson.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093934060&amp;doi=10.3389%2ffvets.2020.563140&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=13890e70dd8f7d5e3bfbd43765a8edac</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sidnyaev, N.I.</author><author>Butenko, I.I.</author><author>Margaryan, T.D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fostering gifted students in a technical university: BMSTU case study</title><secondary-title>AIP Conference Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><volume>2318</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1063/5.0036146</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The article deals with the analysis, generalization and assessment of BMSTU experience in the field of identifying giftedness, ways, and technologies for its development, risks in psychological and pedagogical work while identifying and fostering gifted students.

The validity of preexisting studies needs to be confirmed through replication studies, which there is a lack of. So far, most replication studies have been conducted on non-patients (NP) and primarily investigated cognitive and motor tasks. To fill this gap, we conducted the first fMRI replication study to investigate brain function using disease-related food stimuli in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). Using fMRI, we investigated 31 AN patients and 27 NP for increased amygdala and reduced midcingulate activation when viewing food and non-food stimuli, as reported by the original study (11AN, 11NP; Joos et al., 2011). Similar to the previous study, we observed in the within group comparisons (food&gt;non-food) a frontoinsular activation for both groups. Although in AN the recorded activation clustered more prominently and extended into the cingulate cortex. In the between-group comparisons, the increased amygdala and reduced midcingulate activation could not be replicated. Instead, AN showed a higher activation of the cingulate cortices, the pre-/postcentral gyrus and the inferior parietal lobe. Unlike in the initial study, no significant differences between NP&gt;AN could be observed. The inconsistency of results and the non-replication of the study could have several reasons, such as high inter-individual variance of functional correlates of emotion processing, as well as intra-individual variances and the smaller group size of the initial study. These results underline the importance of replication for assessing the reliability and validity of results from fMRI research. © Copyright © 2020 Horster, Nickel, Holovics, Schmidt, Endres, Tebartz van Elst, Zeeck, Maier and Joos.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089841859&amp;doi=10.3389%2ffpsyt.2020.00777&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=eb0bb1920e9f563a451bbf96507e313f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Y.</author><author>Neyshabur, B.</author><author>Mobahi, H.</author><author>Krishnan, D.</author><author>Bengio, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FANTASTIC GENERALIZATION MEASURES AND WHERE TO FIND THEM</title><secondary-title>8th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2020</secondary-title></titles><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Generalization of deep networks has lately been of great interest, resulting in a number of theoretically and empirically motivated complexity measures.

We train over 10,000 convolutional networks by systematically varying commonly used hyperparameters.

Most current studies on reproductionrelated genes have been conducted on cultured shrimp. However, gene expression is intimately linked to physiological and environmental conditions, and therefore an organism's growth environment has a great influence on reproduction. Thus, gene expression profiling, should be applied in fisheries studies. Here, we identified the expression patterns of 76 reproduction-related genes in P. vannamei via the analysis of pooled transcriptomes from a time-series experiment encompassing a full circadian cycle. The expression patterns of genes associated both directly (Vtg, ODP, and ProR) and indirectly (FAMet, CruA1, and CruC1) with reproduction were evaluated, as these genes could be used as molecular markers of previtellogenic and vitellogenic maturation stages. The evaluated genes were prominently upregulated during vitellogenic stages, with specific expression patterns depending on the organism's environment, diet, and season. Vtg, ProR, ODP, and FaMet could serve as molecular markers for both wild and cultured organisms.  © 2021 Montes-Dominguez et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101924267&amp;doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.10694&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6c03a3cba6f505bfa191d1172e0134cc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mao, C.</author><author>Bariya, P.</author><author>Suo, Y.</author><author>Randall, L.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of Single and Multiple Turnovers of SecYEG in Escherichia coli</title><secondary-title>Journal of Bacteriology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Bacteriology</full-title></periodical><volume>202</volume><number>24</number><issue>24</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JB.00462-20</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Precursor proteins are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane in Escherichia coli by the general secretory, or Sec, pathway. The main components of the pathway are the integral membrane heterotrimeric SecYEG complex and the peripheral membrane ATPase, SecA. In this study, we have applied an in vitro assay using inverted cytoplasmic membrane vesicles to investigate the complex cycle that leads to translocation. We compared the apparent rate constants for nine precursors under two experimental conditions, single turnover and multiple turnovers. For each precursor, the rate constant for a single turnover was higher than for multiple turnovers, indicating that a different step limits the rate under the two conditions. We conclude that the rate-limiting step for a single turnover is an early step in the initial phase of transit through the channel, whereas the rate of multiple turnovers is limited by the resetting of the translocon. The presence of the chaperone SecB during multiple turnovers increased the maximal amplitude translocated for the three precursor species tested, pGBP, pPhoA, and proOmpA, and also increased the apparent rate constants for both pGBP and pPhoA. The rate constant for proOmpA was decreased by the presence of SecB. IMPORTANCE Vastly different experimental techniques and conditions have been used to study export in E. coli. We demonstrated that altering experimental conditions can change the step that is observed during study. Investigators should consider specific experimental conditions when comparing data from different laboratories, as well as when comparing data from different experiments within a laboratory. We have shown that each precursor species has inherent properties that determine the translocation rate; thus generalizations from studies of a single species must be made with caution. A summary of advantages and disadvantages in use of nine precursors is presented. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

It is unknown if this is an effective strategy. Methods: Adult patients receiving a kidney and/or pancreas transplant were included if converted from PPX to PEM between 9/1/19 and 3/1/20 due to leukopenia. A positive CMV viral load (VL) was defined as CMV PCR greater than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) based on local lab testing. A CMV VL of &gt;500 IU/mL was chosen as the preemptive treatment (PET) threshold. Primary objective was to describe the impact of conversion on resolution of leukopenia. Secondary objectives were to assess PEM associated outcomes. Results: There were 49 patients converted from PPX to PEM due to leukopenia in the study period; 88% were KTRs and 96% received lymphocyte-depleting induction; 84% were seropositive at transplant (R+) and 16% were high-risk (D+/R−). Mean WBC at time of enrollment was 1.4 ± 0.4. After PEM conversion, WBC recovered to &gt;3 in 87.8% of the population in a mean of 26.8 ± 24.5 days. Immunosuppression was modified in 96% of the population and GCSF was required in 46.9% of patients. CMV viremia occurred in 36.7% of the population; 78% were KTRs and 94% were R+. Time from PEM enrollment to PET was 64 ± 34 days. Median VL at first detection was 587 IU/mL, median peak was 1920 IU/mL. Five patients (27.8%) presented with symptoms consistent with CMV syndrome, none had end organ disease. Six patients (33%) presented with a VL &lt;500 IU/mL at first detection, but all subsequently surpassed the threshold and required PET. Mean duration of PET was 25 ± 11 days. Mean change in WBC in response to PET was −0.4 ± 1.3. Immunosuppression required further adjustment in 61% of patients. There were no deaths or graft loss due to CMV at last follow-up. Conclusion: In kidney and pancreas transplant recipients who undergo PEM conversion due to leukopenia, withholding of VGC can improve leukopenia, but other concomitant measures are necessary. This population should be considered fairly high risk, with a threshold of treatment of first quantifiable replication. Our findings suggest lack of harm from this approach but highlight the importance of close monitoring to prevent symptomatic replication. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to better evaluate the impact of PEM conversion on late-onset CMV and patient and graft outcomes. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104970319&amp;doi=10.1111%2ftid.13617&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=793e73da9dfcb87d3efdfc8ebe7dc9f6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rani, V.U.</author><author>Rao, M.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PrivGuard: Sensitivity Guided Anonymization based PPDM with Automatic Selection of Sensitive Attributes</title><secondary-title>2021 7th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems, ICACCS 2021</secondary-title></titles><pages>1832-1837</pages><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICACCS51430.2021.9441991</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The concept of Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) is the method of extraction of hidden patterns or knowledge from great volumes of data without revealing sensitive personal or sensitive business information. The data used for data mining operation may contain sensitive data such as Social Security Number, Salary, Name, Credit card Number etc. Disclosure of such information is threat to the privacy of individuals. The aim of PPDM is to provide privacy of sensitive information in the data used for data mining. Several methods have been developed based on Anonymization, Perturbation and Cryptography. All these methods take list of sensitive attributes as input from data owner. Not only that, another limitation is they perform transformations on the data without considering the level of sensitivity of the attributes in order to provide privacy. We proposed a framework for PPDM based on anonymization guided by the sensitivity rank of the attribute. This work also automatically identifies the sensitive attributes in the data.The proposed work, PrivGuard: Sensitivity Guided Anonymization based PPDM with Automatic Selection of Sensitive Attributes finds sensitive attributes in the database by finding the Sensitivity Rank for each attribute. In order to find Sensitivity Rank for attributes it finds the rank of attribute by calculating attribute evaluation measures such as InformationGain, Symmetric Uncertainty attribute evaluation, Gain Ratio, OneR attribute evaluation etc. Then, computes the sensitivity rank and uses this to decide how much anonymization is required to provide the privacy. This method can fix the balance between data privacy and data utility by applying appropriate level of anonymization using taxonomy tree of the attribute. The level of anonymization is calculated by finding the generalization score based on attribute sensitivity rank. Finally, C4.5 and Naive Bayes classifiers are built on anonymized data and compared with other anonymization methods. Our method outperforms than existing methods and observed that our results are very near to results of data mining using original data. © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108025330&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICACCS51430.2021.9441991&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3beea6ae4d66bf0aa4d374142901e856</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mendel, Z.</author><author>Lynch, S.C.</author><author>Eskalen, A.</author><author>Protasov, A.</author><author>Maymon, M.</author><author>Freeman, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What Determines Host Range and Reproductive Performance of an Invasive Ambrosia Beetle Euwallacea fornicatus; Lessons From Israel and California</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Forests and Global Change</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Forests and Global Change</full-title></periodical><volume>4</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/ffgc.2021.654702</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study examined the polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB) Euwallacea fornicatus (Coleoptera; Scolytinae) native to Southeast Asia and concentrated on its wide host range in two of the invaded areas, California and Israel. Among the 583 examined tree species, 55.9% were characterized as “non-reproductive hosts” and only 13.8% were characterized as “reproductive hosts,” suitable for the E. fornicatus reproduction. Families that included ≥20 species and genera with ≥10 were considered for further analysis. The highest percentage of tree species suitable for reproduction was obtained for Salicaceae and Sapindaceae, whereas the lowest percentage of tree species belonging to this category were within the Rosaceae, Myrtaceae, and Magnoliaceae. The genera Acer, Quercus and Acacia displayed the highest percentage within the “reproductive host” category, with the former significantly higher from all seven of the studied genera. We found that all Brachychiton and Erythrina were attacked and none of the examined 20 Eucalyptus spp. were suitable for E. fornicatus reproduction. The results suggest discordance between host tree phylogeny and susceptibility to the E. fornicatus, indicating that trait correlation of susceptibility of different tree species to the E. fornicatus are the results of convergent evolution and not of a common descent. A theoretical model, suggesting the different possibilities of potential tree species becoming attractive or non-attractive to E. fornicatus attack, is described. It is suggested that the beetle reproduction success rate over a wide host range, as well as the long list of species belonging to the “non-reproductive host” category, is the outcome of interactions between the beetle fungal symbiont, F. euwallaceae, and sapwood of the attacked tree. The model suggests that a tree selected by the E. fornicatus may fall in one of three groups, (i) those in which F. euwallaceae is unable to develop, (ii) those tree species that slow the development of the fungus, and (iii) those that enable F. euwallaceae to thrive. Hence, the host range suitable for beetle reproduction is determined by development of F. euwallaceae. In general, PSHB does not distinguish between host species of the “non-reproductive host” and “reproductive host” categories. © Copyright © 2021 Mendel, Lynch, Eskalen, Protasov, Maymon and Freeman.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106191947&amp;doi=10.3389%2fffgc.2021.654702&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e977848d64905ff7c44c43a3711e0ffd</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alisin, V.V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effect of humidity on the tribological behavior of the carbon-carbon composite in brakes</title><secondary-title>IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering</secondary-title></titles><volume>918</volume><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/1757-899X/918/1/012094</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The article is devoted to the study of the humidity effect on the antifriction properties of a carbon-carbon composite material under the brake-applied mode. The effect of friction coefficient reducing due to the hygroscopic properties of this carbon composite is justified. The change in the friction coefficient and the composite structure during braking is investigated. In a macro scale it is shown that the structure of the samples working surface is isotropic both in the initial condition and after friction, which is due to the specific location of the fibrous carbon filler (reinforcing frame) in the volume of this carbon-carbon composite material. Based on the theory of errors, metrological assurance for evaluating the reproduction of experimental data was performed. Based on the obtained quantitative data on the reduction of the friction coefficient and the "drying"time of wet friction surfaces, practical recommendations are defined to ensure the effectiveness of vehicle braking arrangements. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094122567&amp;doi=10.1088%2f1757-899X%2f918%2f1%2f012094&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=76eb647451d2cefac736278e581917e1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lei, Y.</author><author>Yang, Z.</author><author>Yang, T.</author><author>Ying, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stability and Generalization of Stochastic Gradient Methods for Minimax Problems</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</secondary-title></titles><pages>6175-6186</pages><volume>139</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Many machine learning problems can be formulated as minimax problems such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AUC maximization and robust estimation, to mention but a few. A substantial amount of studies are devoted to studying the convergence behavior of their stochastic gradient-type algorithms. In contrast, there is relatively little work on understanding their generalization, i.e., how the learning models built from training examples would behave on test examples. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive generalization analysis of stochastic gradient methods for minimax problems under both convex-concave and nonconvex-nonconcave cases through the lens of algorithmic stability. We establish a quantitative connection between stability and several generalization measures both in expectation and with high probability. For the convex-concave setting, our stability analysis shows that stochastic gradient descent ascent attains optimal generalization bounds for both smooth and nonsmooth minimax problems. We also establish generalization bounds for both weakly-convex-weakly-concave and gradient-dominated problems. We report preliminary experimental results to verify our theory.

While generalisation is common in quantitative research, there is a lack of generalisability in qualitative research. This paper presents the experience and challenges faced by the Designing for People with Dementia (MinD) project in meeting the requirements to strengthen the generalisation of findings on the lived experience of people living with dementia and their engagement to co-create designs to empower their everyday living. Methods: Polit and Beck (2010)'s strategies to generalise qualitative findings were applied: (1) replication in sampling; (2) replication of studies; (3) meta-synthesis of findings; (4) reflexivity and conceptualization; (5) immersion with the data; and (6) thick description. Results: While it is possible to increase the generabilisabilty of qualitative evidence through the replication of the sampling to attain a large, heterogeneous sample in different and multiple contexts and environments; implementation of sound and robust research; conducting in-depth analysis and interpretation collaboratively for emergent themes; and meeting the thick description requirement, there are challenges that the project team faced in implementing some of the Polit and Beck's strategies because of the condition, namely dementia, that our participants are having. Other challenges faced were: the language and cultural diversity in the team; diverse work and organisational procedures; and the inter-disciplinary differences relating to the methods of enquiry, approaches and techniques to conduct research. These challenges will need to be identified and addressed at the start of the project with a strong leadership to ensure a seamless journey to complete the project successfully. Trust between the researchers and participants, and time to build this trust are critical to recruitment and participation in the study; these factors are of utmost important in research involving participants with condition such as dementia. © 2021 Lim JNW et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141990618&amp;doi=10.12688%2fopenreseurope.13700.3&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=84c5416799fee0363d000b3c46e5c907</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Grady, A.C.</author><author>Reeve, S.A.</author><author>Reeve, K.F.</author><author>Vladescu, J.C.</author><author>Deshais, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparing computer-based training and lecture formats to teach visual analysis of baseline-treatment graphs</title><secondary-title>Behavioral Interventions</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Behavioral Interventions</full-title></periodical><pages>67-92</pages><volume>36</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/bin.1752</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Accurate analysis of data is vital to the validation of interventions. As such, there has been a recent increase in studies evaluating visual analysis training procedures. However, past investigations have not evaluated direct and indirect visual analysis training methods with matched instructional content that was systematically designed. Furthermore, training has rarely included assessment of generalization and maintenance of visual analysis skills. The purpose of the current dissertation study was to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of (a) computer-based training, (b) lecture formats with and (c) without the opportunity to pause, and (d) a no-training group to teach visual analysis of AB graphs to university students. To make these formats directly comparable, the instructional content was equated by ensuring information and examples were identical across the three training procedures. Eighty-three students were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. Results showed that all three training formats produced increases in accurate responding compared to the no-training group. Visual analysis skills generalized to novel graphs and maintained approximately 2 weeks following all trainings. These results suggest that structured approaches that are carefully designed to train visual analysis are effective and lead to gains that generalize and maintain in the absence of training. © 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094642229&amp;doi=10.1002%2fbin.1752&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e4e04f806a826b74c49032b20d780409</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, C.A.</author><author>Nolan, J.</author><author>Tritz, D.J.</author><author>Heavener, T.E.</author><author>Pelton, J.</author><author>Cook, K.</author><author>Vassar, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of reproducible and transparent research practices in pulmonology</title><secondary-title>Pulmonology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pulmonology</full-title></periodical><pages>134-143</pages><volume>27</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.pulmoe.2020.07.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Study reproducibility is valuable for validating or refuting results. Provision of reproducibility indicators, such as materials, protocols, and raw data in a study improve its potential for reproduction. Efforts to reproduce noteworthy studies in the biomedical sciences have resulted in an overwhelming majority of them being found to be unreplicable, causing concern for the integrity of research in other fields, including medical specialties. Here, we analyzed the reproducibility of studies in the field of pulmonology. Methods: 500 pulmonology articles were randomly selected from an initial PubMed search for data extraction. Two authors scoured these articles for reproducibility indicators including materials, protocols, raw data, analysis scripts, inclusion in systematic reviews, and citations by replication studies as well as other factors of research transparency including open accessibility, funding source and competing interest disclosures, and study preregistration. Findings: Few publications included statements regarding materials (10%), protocols (1%), data (15%), and analysis script (0%) availability. Less than 10% indicated preregistration. More than half of the publications analyzed failed to provide a funding statement. Conversely, 63% of the publications were open access and 73% included a conflict of interest statement. Interpretation: Overall, our study indicates pulmonology research is currently lacking in efforts to increase replicability. Future studies should focus on providing sufficient information regarding materials, protocols, raw data, and analysis scripts, among other indicators, for the sake of clinical decisions that depend on replicable or refutable results from the primary literature. © 2020 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088975777&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.pulmoe.2020.07.001&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d7ff3505b176ee31c25ebf322de980a0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Podavalenko, A.P.</author><author>Nessonova, T.D.</author><author>Zadorozhna, V.I.</author><author>Hrytsenko, L.М.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ANALIYSIS OF PERTUSSIS MORBIDITY IN UKRAINE</title><secondary-title>Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)</full-title></periodical><pages>1628-1633</pages><volume>74</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.36740/wlek202107114</electronic-resource-num><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The aim: To improve epidemiological monitoring of pertussis by analyzing the disease morbidity during 1995-2017 in Ukraine, to make a prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Analysis of the pertussis morbidity during 1995-2017 using the data of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. The cyclicity was determined by Fourier spectral analysis. The models of prognosis were constructed using polyharmonic regression and an exponential smoothing algorithm. Cartographic analysis and integrated indicators (multiyear index of the prevalence rate, mean square deviation, mean the multiyear pace of the gain in the prevalence rate) were used to determine the areas of risk. Summarized data were used to calculate the generalized coefficient. RESULTS: Results: The pertussis morbidity cycle has 5 years intervals in Ukraine. The prognosis is for increasing the pertussis morbidity from 4.91-5.54 to 5.48-7.06 per 100.000 people. The generalized coefficient was significantly higher in western part (83.3%) than in central (50.0%) and eastern (16.6%) parts. The study showed that population reproduction rates, natural population increase, and the proportion of people against vaccination were higher in the western part than in other parts of the country. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The pertussis cyclicity depends on the internal mechanisms of interaction in the ecological system. There is a prognosis of worsening the epidemic situation of pertussis spreading. The risk area is the western part of Ukraine, which is characterized by active demographic processes and a greater number of people who are negative about vaccination.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115263024&amp;doi=10.36740%2fwlek202107114&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5f7c0cd95dfe7a7f2495153fa3182520</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, J.</author><author>Lu, Y.</author><author>Wang, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Priori Generalization Analysis of the Deep Ritz Method for Solving High Dimensional Elliptic Partial Differential Equations</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</secondary-title></titles><pages>3196-3241</pages><volume>134</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>This paper concerns the a priori generalization analysis of the Deep Ritz Method (DRM) [W. E and B. Yu, 2017], a popular neural-network-based method for solving high dimensional partial differential equations. We derive the generalization error bounds of two-layer neural networks in the framework of the DRM for solving two prototype elliptic PDEs: Poisson equation and static Schrödinger equation on the d-dimensional unit hypercube. Specifically, we prove that the convergence rates of generalization errors are independent of the dimension d, under the a priori assumption that the exact solutions of the PDEs lie in a suitable low-complexity space called spectral Barron space. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions on the forcing term and the potential function which guarantee that the solutions are spectral Barron functions. We achieve this by developing a new solution theory for the PDEs on the spectral Barron space, which can be viewed as an analog of the classical Sobolev regularity theory for PDEs. © 2021 J. Lu, Y.

Methods: We reproduced the findings of a descriptive cohort study using an iterative two-phase approach. In Phase I, a common protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) were implemented by independent investigators using the Aetion Evidence Platform® (AEP), a rapid-cycle analytics tool, and SAS statistical software as a gold standard for statistical analyses. Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) dataset, the study included patients newly diagnosed with MM within primary care setting and assessed baseline demographics, conditions, drug exposure, and laboratory procedures. Phase II incorporated analysis revisions based on our initial comparison of the Phase I findings. Reproducibility of findings was evaluate by calculating the match rate and absolute difference in prevalence between the SAS and AEP study results. Results: Phase I yielded slightly discrepant results, prompting amendments to SAP to add more clarity to operational decisions. After detailed specification of data and operational choices, exact concordance was achieved for the number of eligible patients (N = 2646), demographics, comorbidities (i.e., osteopenia, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease [CVD], and hypertension), bone pain, skeletal-related events, drug exposure, and laboratory investigations in the Phase II analyses. Conclusions: In this reproducibility study, a rapid-cycle analytics tool and traditional statistical software achieved near-exact findings after detailed specification of data and operational choices. Transparency and communication of the study design, operational and analytical choices between independent investigators were critical to achieve this reproducibility. © 2020 The Authors.

At the same time, these programs have noted that the proper way to analyze replication studies is far from a settled matter and have analyzed their data in several different ways. This presents 2 challenges to interpreting the results of these programs. First, different analysis methods assess different operational definitions of replication. Second, the properties of these methods are not necessarily common knowledge; it is possible for a successful replication to be deemed a failure by nearly all of the metrics used, and it is not always immediately clear how likely such errors are to occur. In this article, we describe the methods commonly used in replication research and how they imply specific operational definitions of replication. We then compute the probability of false failure (i.e., a successful replication is concluded to have failed) and false success determinations. These are shown to be high (often over 50%) and in many cases uncontrolled. We then demonstrate that errors are probable in the data to which these methods have been applied in the literature. We show that the probability that some reported conclusions about replication are incorrect can be as high as 75–80%.

These limitations include the fact that a “replication failure” could arise by chance alone with a surprisingly high probability, even if the studies successfully replicate.

This resource was mined to identify emerging mutations and trends in mutations as the outbreak progressed over time. Information on transmission dynamics, prevalence, and persistence of intra-host mutants, and the position of a mutation on a protein were then used to prioritize 544 reported mutations based on their ability to impact ZIKV phenotype. Using this criteria, six mutants (representing naturally occurring mutations) were generated as synthetic infectious clones using a 2015 Puerto Rican epidemic strain PRVABC59 as the parental backbone. The phenotypes of these naturally occurring variants were examined using both cell culture and murine model systems. Mutants had distinct phenotypes, including changes in replication rate, embryo death, and decreased head size. In particular, a NS2B mutant previously detected during in vivo studies in rhesus macaques was found to cause lethal infections in adult mice, abortions in pregnant females, and increased viral genome copies in both brain tissue and blood of female mice. Additionally, mutants with changes in the region of NS3 that interfaces with NS5 during replication displayed reduced replication in the blood of adult mice. This analytical pathway, integrating both bioinformatic and wet lab experiments, provides a foundation for understanding how naturally occurring single mutations affect disease outcome and can be used to predict the of severity of future ZIKV outbreaks. To determine if naturally occurring individual mutations in the Zika virus epidemic genotype affect viral virulence or replication rate in vitro or in vivo, we generated an infectious clone representing the epidemic genotype of stain Puerto Rico, 2015. Using this clone, six mutants were created by changing nucleotides in the genome to cause one to two amino acid substitutions in the encoded proteins. The six mutants we generated represent mutations that differentiated the early epidemic genotype from genotypes that were either ancestral or that occurred later in the epidemic. We assayed each mutant for changes in growth rate, and for virulence in adult mice and pregnant mice. Three of the mutants caused catastrophic embryo effects including increased embryonic death or significant decrease in head diameter. Three other mutants that had mutations in a genome region associated with replication resulted in changes in in vitro and in vivo replication rates. These results illustrate the potential impact of individual mutations in viral phenotype. © 2020 by the authors.

In particular, researchers have taught individuals how to more accurately estimate portion sizes of foods using equivalence-based instruction (EBI). This area of research lacks information on the effects of using nonfood items during EBI. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether nonfood items could be used during training to increase portion-size estimation accuracy. Participants were three adult females. Preferred and nonpreferred foods were used to assess generalization of portion-size estimation accuracy. Foods were identified through an assessment and varied per participant. Two nonfood items were used for training and one novel nonfood item was to assess for generalization. Three classes of stimuli were taught using EBI (i.e., ¼ cup, ½ cup, and 1 cup). The members of each class were represented by portion-size measurement aids, amounts on paper plates, and measuring cups. All participants more accurately estimated each portion size of nonfood items after training sessions. Accurate estimation also generalized to preferred and nonpreferred foods, as well as a novel nonfood item, for all participants. © 2018, Association for Behavior Analysis International.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056408796&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs40732-018-0299-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d366c25b68054d9a3fcf4e7c634d3163</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sreedhar Kumar, S.</author><author>Gunashree, M.</author><author>Ahmed, S.T.</author><author>Sindhuja, M.</author><author>Bhumika, P.</author><author>Anusha, B.</author><author>Ishwarya, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A New Approach of Multilevel Unsupervised Clustering for Detecting Replication Level in Large Image Set</title><secondary-title>Procedia Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><pages>1624-1633</pages><volume>171</volume><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.procs.2020.04.174</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replicate and near-replicate images are variants derived from original images that are common among the large number of images on the cloud, desktop and mobile storage areas respectively. The existence of such near-replicate an image in web search indicates the presence of redundancy and lowers the system performance. The detection of replication is challenging due to the multitude of possible variations of images. In this paper, a new system called Multilevel Clustering for Image Replication Identification (MCIRI) is presented. The proposed MCIRI system aims to identify the replication level of images over the large storage area based on multilevel unsupervised clustering techniques. The MCIRI consists of four stages: feature extraction, first level clustering, second level clustering and replication measurement. In the first stage, the MCIRI extract the three features over each individual image in the image set based on standard statistical operations such as mean, standard deviation and variance. Next stage, the MCIRI split the image feature vector of image-set into 'K' dissimilar groups based on K-means clustering technique. In the third stage, the MCIRI partially identifies the dissimilar cluster over each individual cluster in the cluster set of previous level clustering result. In the final stage, the MCIRI estimate the replication level of each individual cluster in the result of second level clustering based on the cluster validation measure. Experimental results show that the proposed MCIRI is better suitable to estimate the replication level in the image set. © 2020 The Authors.

In the present experimental study, we investigated whether this holds true for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to childhood abuse. We expected that fear generalization under experimental conditions reflects generalization of aversive stimuli to different social domains in real life. Sixty-four women with PTSD after childhood abuse and 30 healthy participants (HC) underwent a differential fear conditioning and generalization paradigm. Online risk ratings, reaction time, and fear-potentiated startle served as dependent variables. Based on the subjectively assessed generalization of triggered intrusions across different domains of life, PTSD participants were split into two groups reporting low (low-GEN) and high (high-GEN) generalization. PTSD patients reported a higher expectation of an aversive event. During fear conditioning, they assessed the risk of danger related to a safety cue slower and showed a blunted fear-potentiated startle toward the danger cue. During generalization testing, reaction time increased in the high-GEN patients and decreased in the HC group with increasing similarity of a stimulus with the conditioned safety cue. Alterations of fear learning in PTSD suggest impaired defensive responses in case of a high threat probability. Moreover, our findings bridge the gap between the generalization of aversive cues during everyday life and laboratory-based experimental parameters: impairments in the processing of cues signaling safety generalize particularly in those patients who report a spreading of PTSD symptoms across different domains of everyday life. © 2019 Society for Psychophysiological Research</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067884546&amp;doi=10.1111%2fpsyp.13422&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ca9be5b438e69fe44172d3e5ea0ae966</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Avinun, R.</author><author>Nevo, A.</author><author>Knodt, A.R.</author><author>Elliott, M.L.</author><author>Hariri, A.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication in Imaging Genetics: The Case of Threat-Related Amygdala Reactivity</title><secondary-title>Biological Psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biological Psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>148-159</pages><volume>84</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.11.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Low replication rates are a concern in most, if not all, scientific disciplines. In psychiatric genetics specifically, targeting intermediate brain phenotypes, which are more closely associated with putative genetic effects, was touted as a strategy leading to increased power and replicability. In the current study, we attempted to replicate previously published associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and threat-related amygdala reactivity, which represents a robust brain phenotype not only implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple disorders, but also used as a biomarker of future risk. Methods: We conducted a literature search for published associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and threat-related amygdala reactivity and found 37 unique findings. Our replication sample consisted of 1117 young adult volunteers (629 women, mean age 19.72 ± 1.25 years) for whom both genetic and functional magnetic resonance imaging data were available. Results: Of the 37 unique associations identified, only three replicated as previously reported. When exploratory analyses were conducted with different model parameters compared to the original findings, significant associations were identified for 28 additional studies: eight of these were for a different contrast/laterality; five for a different gender and/or race/ethnicity; and 15 in the opposite direction and for a different contrast, laterality, gender, and/or race/ethnicity. No significant associations, regardless of model parameters, were detected for six studies. Notably, none of the significant associations survived correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: We discuss these patterns of poor replication with regard to the general strategy of targeting intermediate brain phenotypes in genetic association studies and the growing importance of advancing the replicability of imaging genetics findings. © 2017 Society of Biological Psychiatry</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039745872&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.biopsych.2017.11.010&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=70936dbc571f4edb3d9078726758259b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mohsenzadeh, Y.</author><author>Mullin, C.</author><author>Lahner, B.</author><author>Cichy, R.M.</author><author>Oliva, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reliability and generalizability of similarity-based fusion of meg and fmri data in human ventral and dorsal visual streams</title><secondary-title>Vision (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vision (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>3</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/vision3010008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To build a representation of what we see, the human brain recruits regions throughout the visual cortex in cascading sequence. Recently, an approach was proposed to evaluate the dynamics of visual perception in high spatiotemporal resolution at the scale of the whole brain. This method combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with magnetoencephalography (MEG) data using representational similarity analysis and revealed a hierarchical progression from primary visual cortex through the dorsal and ventral streams. To assess the replicability of this method, we here present the results of a visual recognition neuro-imaging fusion experiment and compare them within and across experimental settings. We evaluated the reliability of this method by assessing the consistency of the results under similar test conditions, showing high agreement within participants. We then generalized these results to a separate group of individuals and visual input by comparing them to the fMRI-MEG fusion data of Cichy et al (2016), revealing a highly similar temporal progression recruiting both the dorsal and ventral streams. Together these results are a testament to the reproducibility of the fMRI-MEG fusion approach and allows for the interpretation of these spatiotemporal dynamic in a broader context. © MDPI AG.

In this study, we compared the efficacy of an explicit approach to an implicit approach when teaching 3 novel grammatical forms varying in linguistic complexity. Method: The study included twenty-five 5-to 8-year-old children with developmental language disorder, 13 of whom were randomized to receive an implicit-only (I-O) intervention whereas the remaining 12 participants were randomized to receive a combined explicit–implicit (E-I) intervention to learn 3 novel grammatical forms. On average, participants completed 4.5 teaching sessions for each form across 9 days. Acquisition was assessed during each teaching session. Approximately 9 days posttreatment for each form, participants completed probes to assess maintenance and generalization. Results: Analyses revealed a meaningful and statistically significant learning advantage for the E-I group on acquisition, maintenance, and generalization measures when performance was collapsed across the 3 novel targets ( p &lt;.02, Φs &gt; 0.60). Significant differences between the groups, with the E-I group outperforming the I-O group, only emerged for 1 of the 3 target forms. However, all effect sizes ranged from medium to large (Φs = 0.25–0.76), and relative risk calculations all exceeded 0, indicating a greater likelihood of learning the target form with E-I instruction than I-O instruction. Conclusions: Study findings indicate that, as compared to implicit instruction, children are more likely to acquire, maintain, and generalize novel grammatical forms when taught with explicit instruction. Further research is needed to evaluate the use of explicit instruction when teaching true grammatical forms to children with language impairment. © 2018 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051480560&amp;doi=10.1044%2f2018_JSLHR-L-17-0339&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=19e4309c7bf02f8dac9007910091bd6a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, C.</author><author>Laxminarayan, S.</author><author>David Cashmere, J.</author><author>Germain, A.</author><author>Reifman, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inter-channel phase differences during sleep spindles are altered in Veterans with PTSD</title><secondary-title>NeuroImage: Clinical</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NeuroImage: Clinical</full-title></periodical><volume>28</volume><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102390</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sleep disturbances are common complaints in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To date, however, objective markers of PTSD during sleep remain elusive. Sleep spindles are distinctive bursts of brain oscillatory activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and have been implicated in sleep protection and sleep-dependent memory processes. In healthy sleep, spindles observed in electroencephalogram (EEG) data are highly synchronized across different regions of the scalp. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the spatiotemporal synchronization patterns between EEG channels during sleep spindles, as quantified by the phase-locking value (PLV) and the mean phase difference (MPD), are altered in PTSD. Using high-density (64-channel) EEG data recorded from 78 combat-exposed Veteran men (31 with PTSD and 47 without PTSD) during two consecutive nights of sleep, we examined group differences in the PLV and MPD for slow (10–13 Hz) and fast (13–16 Hz) spindles separately. To evaluate the reproducibility of our findings, we set apart the first 47 consecutive participants (18 with PTSD) for the initial discovery and reserved the remaining 31 participants (13 with PTSD) for replication analysis. In the discovery analysis, compared to the non-PTSD group, the PTSD group showed smaller MPDs during slow spindles between the frontal and centro-parietal channel pairs on both nights. We obtained reproducible results in the replication analysis in terms of statistical significance and effect size. The PLVs during slow or fast spindles did not significantly differ between groups. The reduced inter-channel phase difference during slow spindles in PTSD may reflect pathological changes in the underlying thalamocortical circuits. This novel finding, if independently validated, may prove useful in developing sleep-focused PTSD diagnostics and interventions. © 2020</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089997771&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.nicl.2020.102390&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=415cb4c3d5e7379f8559dc75f1d89619</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Groom, J.</author><author>Friedrich, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bridging the lab-field interface in fluvial morphology at patch-scale: Using close-range photogrammetry to assess surface replication and vegetation influence</title><secondary-title>River Research and Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>River Research and Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1328-1337</pages><volume>34</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/rra.3370</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In fluvial research, comparisons of laboratory and field data sets are rare or outdated; therefore, future research would benefit from the integration of laboratory and field data sets. We use close-range photogrammetry as a tool to help bridge that interface. Close-range photogrammetry is a technique that is readily applied in both laboratory and field environments to capture submillimetre topographic data of natural and replica surfaces of gravel-bed rivers. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of difference (DoDs) are presented to quantitatively assess the replicability of four surfaces, using the casting process. Replication results with accuracies of &lt;35 mm, including observed localized areas of particle dislodgement, suggest casting is a suitable process to integrate laboratory and field data sets in fluvial morphology, allowing natural surfaces (e.g., from the field) to be analysed in a controlled laboratory environment. This enables the isolation of parameters, such as the microtopography of the surface or water submergence. Further, we highlight the importance of considerations of the wider scale morphology required to contextualize patch-scale field research using close-range photogrammetry. We demonstrate this with an example of the influence of vegetation on DEM quality and roughness statistics. These wider morphological features are difficult to simulate in the laboratory, albeit have a control on patch-scale processes. The successful replication of natural surfaces using casting and the use of tools such as close-range photogrammetry provide a bridge for future research that requires the integration of laboratory experiments, field experiments, and numerical modelling. © 2018 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055737121&amp;doi=10.1002%2frra.3370&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1f6b885ed8eda52576b340a79d9a95e2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gotlieb, N.</author><author>Tachlytski, I.</author><author>Lapidot, Y.</author><author>Sultan, M.</author><author>Safran, M.</author><author>Ben-Ari, Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hepatitis B virus downregulates vitamin D receptor levels in hepatoma cell lines, thereby preventing vitamin D-dependent inhibition of viral transcription and production</title><secondary-title>Molecular Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Medicine</full-title></periodical><volume>24</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s10020-018-0055-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Vitamin D is a key immune-modulator that plays a role in the innate and adaptive immune systems. Certain pathogens impair the immune defense by downregulating the vitamin D receptor (VDR) pathway. Low serum levels of vitamin D are associated with increased hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Our study aimed to assess the in-vitro relationship between HBV production and Vitamin D signaling pathway and to explore the associated mechanism(s). Methods: HBV transcription and replication was evaluated by qRT-PCR of the HBV-RNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Furthermore, we have transfected the 1.3 X HBV-Luc plasmid to the cells and measured the Luciferase activity using Luminometer. Vitamin D signaling pathway activation was evaluated by measuring the expression levels of VDR, CYP24A1, Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and cathelicidin (CAMP) by qRT-PCR. All assays were performed on HepG2.2.15, HepG2, and HepAD38 cells treated with or without Vitamin D active metabolite: calcitriol. Results: Calcitriol did not suppress HBV transcription, cccDNA expression or HBV RNA levels in HepG2.2.15 cells. However, VDR transcript levels in HepG2.215 cells were significantly lower compared to HepG2 cells. Similar results were obtained in HepAD38 cell where VDR expression was down-regulated when HBV transcript level was up-regulated. In addition, calcitriol induced VDR-associated signaling, resulting in upregulation of CYP24A1, TNFα and CAMP expression level in HepG2 cells but not in the HepG2.2.15 cells. Conclusions: These findings indicate that VDR expression is downregulated in HBV-transfected cells, thereby preventing vitamin D from inhibiting transcription and translation of HBV in vitro. HBV might use this mechanism to avoid the immunological defense system by affecting both TNFα and CAMP signaling pathways. © 2018 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055071632&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs10020-018-0055-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0e95852a59072884092fe3da733cb44a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Evans, R.</author><author>Haas, M.</author><author>Schulz, C.</author><author>Leininger, B.</author><author>Hanson, L.</author><author>Bronfort, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spinal manipulation and exercise for low back pain in adolescents: A randomized trial</title><secondary-title>Pain</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pain</full-title></periodical><pages>1297-1307</pages><volume>159</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001211</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Low back pain (LBP) is common in adolescence, but there is a paucity of high-quality research to inform care. We conducted a multicenter randomized trial comparing 12 weeks of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) combined with exercise therapy (ET) to ET alone. Participants were 185 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years with chronic LBP. The primary outcome was LBP severity at 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included disability, quality of life, medication use, patient- and caregiver-rated improvement, and satisfaction. Outcomes were analyzed using longitudinal linear mixed effect models. An omnibus test assessing differences in individual outcomes over the entire year controlled for multiplicity. Of the 185 enrolled patients, 179 (97%) provided data at 12 weeks and 174 (94%) at 26 and 52 weeks. Adding SMT to ET resulted in a larger reduction in LBP severity over the course of 1 year (P = 0.007). The group difference in LBP severity (0-10 scale) was small at the end of treatment (mean difference = 0.5; P = 0.08) but was larger at weeks 26 (mean difference = 1.1; P = 0.001) and 52 (mean difference = 0.8; P = 0.009). At 26 weeks, SMT with ET performed better than ET alone for disability (P = 0.04) and improvement (P = 0.02). The SMT with ET group reported significantly greater satisfaction with care at all time points (P ≤ 0.02). There were no serious treatment-related adverse events. For adolescents with chronic LBP, spinal manipulation combined with exercise was more effective than exercise alone over a 1-year period, with the largest differences occurring at 6 months. These findings warrant replication and evaluation of cost effectiveness. © 2018 International Association for the Study of Pain.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049495275&amp;doi=10.1097%2fj.pain.0000000000001211&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8dd4173e2b6f442168b254ddd82c1014</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chianucci, F.</author><author>Lucibelli, A.</author><author>Dell'Abate, M.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of ground canopy cover in agricultural crops using downward-looking photography</title><secondary-title>Biosystems Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosystems Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>209-216</pages><volume>169</volume><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2018.02.012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fast and accurate estimates of canopy cover are central for a wide range of agricultural applications and studies. Visual assessment is a traditionally employed method to estimate canopy cover in the field, but it is limited by the costs, subjectivity and non-reproducibility of the produced estimates. Digital photography is a low-cost alternative method. In this study we tested two automated image classification methods, the first one based on a histogram-analysis method (Rosin), the second one based on a combination of a visible vegetation index and the L*a*b* colour space conversion (LAB2), which have both been previously tested in forestry, and a supervised image classification method (Winscanopy), to estimate canopy cover from downward-looking images of agricultural crops. These methods were tested using artificial images with known cover; this allowed exploring the influence of canopy density and object size on canopy cover estimation from photography. The Rosin method provided the best estimates of canopy cover in artificial images, whose accuracy was largely unaffected by variation in canopy density and object size. By contrast, LAB2 systematically overestimated canopy cover, because of the sensitivity of the method to small variations of chromaticity in artificial images. Winscanopy showed good performance when at least two regions per class were manually selected from a representative image. The results were replicated in real images of cultivated aromatic crops. The main findings indicate that digital photography is an effective method to obtain rapid, robust and reproducible measures of canopy cover in downward-looking images of agricultural crops, including aromatic plants. © 2018 IAgrE</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043589331&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.biosystemseng.2018.02.012&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b1142751a2f86224d745f13ba9c0cf53</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stadler, D.S.</author><author>Oliver, B.J.</author><author>Raymond, J.G.</author><author>Routzhan, G.F.</author><author>Flaherty, E.A.</author><author>Stahl, J.E.</author><author>Batsis, J.A.</author><author>Bartels, S.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reducing Avoidable Facility Transfers (RAFT): Outcomes of a Team Model to Minimize Unwarranted Emergency Care at Skilled Nursing Facilities</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Medical Directors Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Medical Directors Association</full-title></periodical><pages>929-934</pages><volume>20</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jamda.2019.03.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Acute health care interventions for residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are often unwarranted, unwanted, and/or harmful. We describe a provider-focused care model to reduce unwarranted or unwanted acute health care utilization. Objective: Assess the capability of the Reducing Avoidable Facility Transfers (RAFT) model to reduce unwanted and unwarranted acute health care utilization among residents in 3 rural SNFs between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Design: Prospective cohort, pre/post study. Setting: Three rural SNFs in collaboration with a geriatric practice in a tertiary academic medical center. Participants: Post-acute care (PAC) and long-term care (LTC) residents of 3 rural SNFs. Intervention: RAFT includes the following components: (1) a small team of providers who manage longitudinal care and after hours call; (2) elicitation of advance care plans and preferences regarding acute care; (3) standardized communication process engaging the provider at the identification of an acute care event; (4) a biweekly case review of all emergency department (ED) transfers. Measures: ED and hospital utilization. Results: RAFT demonstrated a 35% reduction in monthly ED transfers and a 30.5% reduction in monthly hospitalizations. These reductions were greatest for LTC residents. Conclusions/Implications: The RAFT approach substantially reduced unwarranted ED and hospital utilization in this study.

Mycotoxins, such as T-2 toxin or deoxynivalenol (DON) produced by Fusarium spp., a plant pathogen mould, occur frequently in temperate climates. Folsomia candida is a mainly fungal feeding collembolan, which has a role in the regulation of the soil microbial community and humification. We hypothesized that F. candida is adapted to the secondary metabolites of the moulds; therefore, Fusarium mycotoxins do not have an effect on their feed intake and reproduction. OECD experiments were carried out with T-2 or DON-contaminated maize and baker's yeast as an alternative food. An additional experiment was conducted without baker's yeast as well as a food choice test. It was found that DON or T-2 toxin caused significant mortality. Severe impairment in reproduction was also observed, accompanied with mycotoxin contaminated feed refusal. Results of feed refusal themselves cannot be the cause of the low reproduction rate; instead, the mycotoxins most likely impair the embryonic development due to their DNA destructive properties. Additionally, DON and T-2 toxin caused feeding inhibition. Both mycotoxins are known to disturb the dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurons, which may disturb the feeding behaviour, and both trichothecenes can cause lesions in the mouth and gut, which may also resulted feed refusal. © 2019, Hungarian Natural History Museum.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078238385&amp;doi=10.17109%2fAZH.65.4.323.2019&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9f9b0fc35a7e39f4465c96dae386c99b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pereira Junior, A.M.</author><author>Camargo-Mathias, M.I.</author><author>Daemon, E.</author><author>Peconick, A.P.</author><author>Lima-Souza, J.R.</author><author>Oliveira, P.R.</author><author>Braga, A.S.</author><author>Lara, L.J.</author><author>Remedio, R.N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficacy of carvacrol on Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus engorged female ticks (Canestrini, 1887) (Acari: Ixodidae): effects on mortality and reproduction</title><secondary-title>Natural Product Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Natural Product Research</full-title></periodical><pages>3428-3431</pages><volume>34</volume><number>23</number><issue>23</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14786419.2019.1569657</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The activity of carvacrol was evaluated in R. microplus female ticks by estimating the mean lethal concentration (LC50) and the acaricidal efficacy.

The following parameters were evaluated: female weight before oviposition, egg mass weight, pre-oviposition and incubation period, hatching percentage, egg production index, fecundity rate, estimated reproduction, reduction in oviposition and hatching, and product efficacy. The obtained LC50 was 20.11 mg/mL. Egg mass weight, egg production index, pre-oviposition and fecundity rates of groups treated with 80% and 100% of LC50 were statistically different when compared to control groups. The product efficacy in groups treated with 100% of LC50 was 61.10%. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061577836&amp;doi=10.1080%2f14786419.2019.1569657&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=277a12e83997aac8b5d90c8e0765d4b6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bua, G.</author><author>Conti, I.</author><author>Manaresi, E.</author><author>Sethna, P.</author><author>Foster, S.</author><author>Bonvicini, F.</author><author>Gallinella, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antiviral activity of brincidofovir on parvovirus B19</title><secondary-title>Antiviral Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antiviral Research</full-title></periodical><pages>22-29</pages><volume>162</volume><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.12.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Parvovirus B19 (B19V), a single-stranded DNA virus in the family Parvoviridae, is a human pathogenic virus responsible for a wide range of clinical manifestations. Currently there is no approved antiviral therapy for parvovirus infection. The acyclic nucleoside phosphonate cidofovir (CDV) has been demonstrated to inhibit replication of B19V in vitro. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether brincidofovir (BCV), a novel lipid conjugate of CDV, could also inhibit B19V replication. Experiments were carried out in erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) and UT7/EpoS1 cells, infected with B19V and cultured in the presence of different concentrations of BCV and CDV for comparison. The dynamics of viral replication was evaluated by a qPCR-based assay and the extent of inhibition of viral replication exerted by the compounds determined, along with the effect of the compounds on cell viability and cell proliferation rates. Results confirmed that BCV showed significantly higher antiviral activity against B19V compared to CDV in both cell-based systems. For BCV, the calculated EC50 values were in the range 6.6–14.3 μM in EPCs and 0.22–0.63 μM in UT7/EpoS1 cells. In comparison, the EC50 values for CDV were &gt;300 μM in EPCs and 16.1 μM in UT7/EpoS1 cells. Concurrently, the effects on cell viability were observed at a much higher concentration of BCV, with calculated CC50 values in the range 93.4–102.9 μM in EPCs and 59.9–66.8 μM in UT7/Epos1. The antiviral activity was observed specifically with the metabolically active stereoisomer of BCV suggesting that CDV-diphosphate, the metabolite of both BCV and CDV, was the active antiviral. Our results support a selective role for BCV in the inhibition of B19 viral replication. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058222063&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.antiviral.2018.12.003&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1dfe9f474479b36819e96d98b93042a6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, B.</author><author>Hu, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Toward training and assessing reproducible data analysis in data science education</title><secondary-title>Data Intelligence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Data Intelligence</full-title></periodical><pages>381-392</pages><volume>1</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1162/dint_a_00053</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research. Data science is not an exception. In recent years scientists were concerned about a large number of irreproducible studies. Such reproducibility crisis in science could severely undermine public trust in science and science-based public policy. Recent efforts to promote reproducible research mainly focused on matured scientists and much less on student training. In this study, we conducted action research on students in data science to evaluate to what extent students are ready for communicating reproducible data analysis. The results show that although two-thirds of the students claimed they were able to reproduce results in peer reports, only one-third of reports provided all necessary information for replication. The actual replication results also include conflicting claims; some lacked comparisons of original and replication results, indicating that some students did not share a consistent understanding of what reproducibility means and how to report replication results. The findings suggest that more training is needed to help data science students communicating reproducible data analysis. © 2019 Chinese Academy of Sciences Published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087408658&amp;doi=10.1162%2fdint_a_00053&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a3bf9b215f035e934a176ff463d2a7ba</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Violanti, M.T.</author><author>Kelly, S.E.</author><author>Garland, M.E.</author><author>Christen, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Instructor Clarity, Humor, Immediacy, and Student Learning: Replication and Extension</title><secondary-title>Communication Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Communication Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>251-262</pages><volume>69</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/10510974.2018.1466718</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study replicates and extends three widely cited instructional communication research studies regarding instructor clarity, humor, immediacy, and students’ learning: Richmond, Gorham, and McCroskey (1987), Wanzer and Frymier (1999), and Chesebro and McCroskey (2001).

Such practices have been implicated in the low rates of reproducible results found in large scale replication studies in psychology. What are the causes and the prevalence of QRPs? In the present paper we present the work by John, Loewenstein, and Prelec (2012) who surveyed academic psychologists at U.S. universities and found that a surprisingly large percentage had engaged in QRPs. We investigated the prevalence of the same QRPs studied by John et al. among Italian psychologists (members of the Association of Italian Psychologists). The results were strikingly similar to those obtained for U.S. psychologists, showing that QRPs are about equally widespread in both research communities. The similarity of results obtained in the United States, this Italian study, and a related study conducted in Germany, suggests that adoption of these practices is an international phenomenon and is likely due to systemic features of the international research and publication processes. © 2019 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

The equivalent model assumes using a surrogate layer made of dielectric of higher thickness and maintained value of surface resistance. Such an approach allows decreasing computer effort required for electromagnetic analysis with 3D discrete methods. The present work extends to real-life scenarios, wherein a thin microwave susceptor is placed below food. Evaluation of the macroscopic model accuracy and limits of application is conducted with the aid of analytical calculations and conformal finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations. The results of the analysis are generalised to give practical guidelines for microwave oven and food packaging designers and manufacturers. © Editorial Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, 2019.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075439932&amp;doi=10.4995%2fAmpere2019.2019.9847&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9731b7ef85a19e4922d1082504bb27e1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oneto, L.</author><author>Cipollini, F.</author><author>Ridella, S.</author><author>Anguita, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Randomized learning: Generalization performance of old and new theoretically grounded algorithms</title><secondary-title>Neurocomputing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neurocomputing</full-title></periodical><pages>21-33</pages><volume>298</volume><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.neucom.2017.10.066</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In the context of assessing the generalization abilities of a randomized model or learning algorithm, PAC-Bayes and Differential Privacy (DP) theories are the state-of-the-art tools.

Indeed, DNA combing shows that PREP1 down-regulation affects DNA replication rate, increases the number of simultaneously firing origins and the asymmetry of DNA replication, leading to DNA damage. Genome-wide analysis of replication timing by Repli-seq shows that, upon PREP1 down-regulation, 25% of the genome is replicated earlier in the S-phase. The targeted DNA sequences correspond to Lamin-Associated Domains (LADs), and include late-replicating (LRRs) and temporal transition regions (TTRs). Notably, the distribution of PREP1 DNA binding sites and of its target genes indicates that DNA replication defects are independent of the overall PREP1 transcriptional activity. Finally, PREP1 down-regulation causes a substantial decrease in Lamin B1 levels. This suggests that DNA is released from the nuclear lamina earlier than in the control cells and is available for replication, thus explaining timing defects and DNA damage. This is the first evidence that the replication timing of a specific fraction of the human genome is affected by PREP1 tumor suppressor. This previously unknown function might significantly contribute to the genomic instability observed in human tumors. © 2018 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042218706&amp;doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-21363-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b12add0bdefef3d124b08113811bbae9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hippel, S.</author><author>Hoeppner, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biased judgements of fairness in bargaining: A replication in the laboratory</title><secondary-title>International Review of Law and Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Review of Law and Economics</full-title></periodical><pages>63-74</pages><volume>58</volume><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.irle.2019.02.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In an influential paper, Babcock, Loewenstein, Issacharoff, and Camerer (1995) uncover evidence that knowledge about one's role in a settlement bargaining situation increases the frequency of bargaining impasse. The authors argue that role knowledge triggers self-serving interpretations of the case-related information that is the foundation of settlement bargaining. Self-servingly biased perception subsequently impedes successful settlement bargaining. We replicate the experiment in the computer laboratory. Our results are largely in line with the original findings. When participants know their bargaining role before studying the case materials rather than afterwards, settlement frequency decreases. This treatment effect is substantially smaller than in the original study. Given the new data, a Bayesian replication analysis reallocates the large share of credibility to a null model. We argue that this result is driven by the much smaller effect size that we observe in the highly controlled environment of the laboratory. Moreover, we extend the original analysis by estimating causal mediation effects of self-serving bias measures on the observed relationship between role-knowledge and settlement outcomes and find that self-servingly weighing legal arguments completely mediates the negative effect of role-knowledge on settlement frequency. In conclusion, we evaluate our replication as successful. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062172286&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.irle.2019.02.001&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ba16f524c5a9368ed89ca157d4657872</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pauli, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Statistical Model to Investigate the Reproducibility Rate Based on Replication Experiments</title><secondary-title>International Statistical Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Statistical Review</full-title></periodical><pages>68-79</pages><volume>87</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/insr.12273</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The reproducibility crisis, that is, the fact that many scientific results are difficult to replicate, pointing to their unreliability or falsehood, is a hot topic in the recent scientific literature, and statistical methodologies, testing procedures and p-values, in particular, are at the centre of the debate. Assessment of the extent of the problem–the reproducibility rate or the false discovery rate–and the role of contributing factors are still an open problem. Replication experiments, that is, systematic replications of existing results, may offer relevant information on these issues. We propose a statistical model to deal with such information, in particular to estimate the reproducibility rate and the effect of some study characteristics on its reliability. We analyse data from a recent replication experiment in psychology finding a reproducibility rate broadly coherent with other assessments from the same experiment. Our results also confirm the expected role of some contributing factor (unexpectedness of the result and room for bias) while they suggest that the similarity between original study and the replica is not so relevant, thus mitigating some criticism directed to replication experiments. © 2018 The Authors.

However, in order to efficiently use the video material after surgery, the video content needs to be analyzed automatically. Important semantic content to be analyzed and indexed in these short videos are operation instruments, since they provide an indication of the corresponding operation phase and surgical action. Related work has already shown that it is possible to accurately detect instruments in cataract surgery videos. However, their underlying dataset (from the CATARACTS challenge) has very good visual quality, which is not reflecting the typical quality of videos acquired in general hospitals. In this paper, we therefore analyze the generalization performance of deep learning models for instrument recognition in terms of dataset change. More precisely, we trained such models as ResNet-50, Inception v3 and NASNet Mobile using a dataset of high visual quality (CATARACTS) and test it on another dataset with low visual quality (Cataract-101), and vice versa. Our results show that the generalizability is surprisingly low in general, but slightly worse for the model trained on the high-quality dataset. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080967284&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-37734-2_51&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7093b2b0d3c387a34d4ddac812362518</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mori, J.F.</author><author>Chen, L.-X.</author><author>Jessen, G.L.</author><author>Rudderham, S.B.</author><author>McBeth, J.M.</author><author>Lindsay, M.B.J.</author><author>Slater, G.F.</author><author>Banfield, J.F.</author><author>Warren, L.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Putative mixotrophic nitrifying-denitrifying gammaproteobacteria implicated in nitrogen cycling within the ammonia/oxygen transition zone of an oil sands pit lake</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><number>OCT</number><issue>OCT</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fmicb.2019.02435</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Anthropogenically-impacted environments offer the opportunity to discover novel microbial species and metabolisms, which may be undetectable in natural systems. Here, a combined metagenomic and geochemical study in Base Mine Lake, Alberta, Canada, which is the only oil sands end pit lake to date, revealed that nitrification was performed by members from Nitrosomonadaceae, Chloroflexi and unclassified Gammaproteobacteria “MBAE14.” While Nitrosomonadaceae and Chloroflexi groups were relatively abundant in the upper oxygenated zones, MBAE14 dominated the hypoxic hypolimnetic zones (approximately 30% of total microbial communities); MBAE14 was not detected in the underlying anoxic tailings. Replication rate analyses indicate that MBAE14 grew in metalimnetic and hypolimnetic water cap regions, most actively at the metalimnetic, ammonia/oxygen transition zone consistent with it putatively conducting nitrification. Detailed genomic analyses of MBAE14 evidenced both ammonia oxidation and denitrification into dinitrogen capabilities. However, the absence of known CO2-fixation genes suggests a heterotrophic denitrifying metabolism. Functional marker genes of ammonia oxidation (amo and hao) in the MBAE14 genome are homologous with those conserved in autotrophic nitrifiers, but not with those of known heterotrophic nitrifiers. We propose that this novel MBAE14 inhabits the specific ammonia-rich, oxygen and labile organic matter-limited conditions occurring in Base Mine Lake which selectively favors mixotrophic coupled nitrifier denitrification metabolism. Our results highlight the opportunities to better constrain biogeochemical cycles from the application of metagenomics to engineered systems associated with extractive resource sectors. © 2019 Mori, Chen, Jessen, Rudderham, McBeth, Lindsay, Slater, Banfield and Warren.

Recently, a rule-based approach called safe was proposed to automatically extract app features from user reviews. safe was reported to obtain superior performance in terms of precision and recall over previously proposed techniques. However, the procedure used to evaluate safe was in part subjective and not repeatable and thus the whole evaluation might not be reliable. [Question/problem] The goal of our study is to perform an external replication of the safe evaluation using an objective and repeatable approach. [Principal ideas/results] To this end, we first implemented safe and checked the correctness of our implementation on the set of app descriptions that were used and published by the authors of the original study. We applied our safe implementation to eight review datasets (six app review datasets, one laptop review dataset, one restaurant review dataset) and evaluated its performance against manually annotated feature terms. Our results suggest that the precision of the safe approach is strongly influenced by the density of the annotated app features in a review dataset. Overall, we obtained an average precision and recall of 0.120 and 0.539, respectively which is lower than the performance reported in the original safe study. [Contribution] We performed an unbiased and reproducible evaluation of the safe approach for user reviews. We make our implementation and all datasets used for the evaluation available for replication by others. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064054083&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-15538-4_2&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c4dc047f708b5cf9c44319efec0d1a9a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wan, N.</author><author>Weinberg, D.</author><author>Liu, T.-Y.</author><author>Niehaus, K.</author><author>Ariazi, E.A.</author><author>Delubac, D.</author><author>Kannan, A.</author><author>White, B.</author><author>Bailey, M.</author><author>Bertin, M.</author><author>Boley, N.</author><author>Bowen, D.</author><author>Cregg, J.</author><author>Drake, A.M.</author><author>Ennis, R.</author><author>Fransen, S.</author><author>Gafni, E.</author><author>Hansen, L.</author><author>Liu, Y.</author><author>Otte, G.L.</author><author>Pecson, J.</author><author>Rice, B.</author><author>Sanderson, G.E.</author><author>Sharma, A.</author><author>St John, J.</author><author>Tang, C.</author><author>Tzou, A.</author><author>Young, L.</author><author>Putcha, G.</author><author>Haque, I.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine learning enables detection of early-stage colorectal cancer by whole-genome sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA</title><secondary-title>BMC Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Cancer</full-title></periodical><volume>19</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12885-019-6003-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Blood-based methods using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are under development as an alternative to existing screening tests. However, early-stage detection of cancer using tumor-derived cfDNA has proven challenging because of the small proportion of cfDNA derived from tumor tissue in early-stage disease. A machine learning approach to discover signatures in cfDNA, potentially reflective of both tumor and non-tumor contributions, may represent a promising direction for the early detection of cancer. Methods: Whole-genome sequencing was performed on cfDNA extracted from plasma samples (N = 546 colorectal cancer and 271 non-cancer controls). Reads aligning to protein-coding gene bodies were extracted, and read counts were normalized. cfDNA tumor fraction was estimated using IchorCNA. Machine learning models were trained using k-fold cross-validation and confounder-based cross-validations to assess generalization performance. Results: In a colorectal cancer cohort heavily weighted towards early-stage cancer (80% stage I/II), we achieved a mean AUC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.91-0.93) with a mean sensitivity of 85% (95% CI 83-86%) at 85% specificity. Sensitivity generally increased with tumor stage and increasing tumor fraction. Stratification by age, sequencing batch, and institution demonstrated the impact of these confounders and provided a more accurate assessment of generalization performance. Conclusions: A machine learning approach using cfDNA achieved high sensitivity and specificity in a large, predominantly early-stage, colorectal cancer cohort. The possibility of systematic technical and institution-specific biases warrants similar confounder analyses in other studies. Prospective validation of this machine learning method and evaluation of a multi-analyte approach are underway. © 2019 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071438244&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12885-019-6003-8&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a2cc3d7dd4b14b1f3fdad7759493856c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Y.</author><author>Kweon, S.-S.</author><author>Tanikawa, C.</author><author>Jia, W.-H.</author><author>Xiang, Y.-B.</author><author>Cai, Q.</author><author>Zeng, C.</author><author>Schmit, S.L.</author><author>Shin, A.</author><author>Matsuo, K.</author><author>Jee, S.H.</author><author>Kim, D.-H.</author><author>Kim, J.</author><author>Wen, W.</author><author>Shi, J.</author><author>Guo, X.</author><author>Li, B.</author><author>Wang, N.</author><author>Zhang, B.</author><author>Li, X.</author><author>Shin, M.-H.</author><author>Li, H.-L.</author><author>Ren, Z.</author><author>Oh, J.H.</author><author>Oze, I.</author><author>Ahn, Y.-O.</author><author>Jung, K.J.</author><author>Conti, D.V.</author><author>Schumacher, F.R.</author><author>Rennert, G.</author><author>Jenkins, M.A.</author><author>Campbell, P.T.</author><author>Hoffmeister, M.</author><author>Casey, G.</author><author>Gruber, S.B.</author><author>Gao, J.</author><author>Gao, Y.-T.</author><author>Pan, Z.-Z.</author><author>Kamatani, Y.</author><author>Zeng, Y.-X.</author><author>Shu, X.-O.</author><author>Long, J.</author><author>Matsuda, K.</author><author>Zheng, W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Study of East Asians Identifies Loci Associated With Risk for Colorectal Cancer</title><secondary-title>Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>1455-1466</pages><volume>156</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1053/j.gastro.2018.11.066</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background &amp; Aims: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have associated approximately 50 loci with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)—nearly one third of these loci were initially associated with CRC in studies conducted in East Asian populations. We conducted a GWAS of East Asians to identify CRC risk loci and evaluate the generalizability of findings from GWASs of European populations to Asian populations. Methods: We analyzed genetic data from 22,775 patients with CRC (cases) and 47,731 individuals without cancer (controls) from 14 studies in the Asia Colorectal Cancer Consortium. First, we performed a meta-analysis of 7 GWASs (10,625 cases and 34,595 controls) and identified 46,554 promising risk variants for replication by adding them to the Multi-Ethnic Global Array (MEGA) for genotype analysis in 6445 cases and 7175 controls. These data were analyzed, along with data from an additional 5705 cases and 5961 controls genotyped using the OncoArray. We also obtained data from 57,976 cases and 67,242 controls of European descent. Variants at identified risk loci were functionally annotated and evaluated in correlation with gene expression levels. Results: A meta-analyses of all samples from people of Asian descent identified 13 loci and 1 new variant at a known locus (10q24.2) associated with risk of CRC at the genome-wide significance level of P &lt; 5 × 10                             –8                             . We did not perform experiments to replicate these associations in additional individuals of Asian ancestry. However, the lead risk variant in 6 of these loci was also significantly associated with risk of CRC in European descendants. A strong association (44%–75% increase in risk per allele) was found for 2 low-frequency variants: rs201395236 at 1q44 (minor allele frequency, 1.34%) and rs77969132 at 12p11.21 (minor allele frequency, 1.53%). For 8 of the 13 associated loci, the variants with the highest levels of significant association were located inside or near the protein-coding genes L1TD1, EFCAB2, PPP1R21, SLCO2A1, HLA-G, NOTCH4, DENND5B, and GNAS. For other intergenic loci, we provided evidence for the possible involvement of the genes ALDH7A1, PRICKLE1, KLF5, WWOX, and GLP2R. We replicated findings for 41 of 52 previously reported risk loci. Conclusions: We showed that most of the risk loci previously associated with CRC risk in individuals of European descent were also associated with CRC risk in East Asians. Furthermore, we identified 13 loci significantly associated with risk for CRC in Asians. Many of these loci contained genes that regulate the immune response, Wnt signaling to β-catenin, prostaglandin E2 catabolism, and cell pluripotency and proliferation. Further analyses of these genes and their variants is warranted, particularly for the 8 loci for which the lead CRC risk variants were not replicated in persons of European descent.                          © 2019 AGA Institute</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063365207&amp;doi=10.1053%2fj.gastro.2018.11.066&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=927016d4337cf97b973b7dc1c383e053</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bao, Z.</author><author>Huang, K.</author><author>Huang, T.</author><author>Shen, B.</author><author>Zong, C.</author><author>Chen, K.</author><author>Yuan, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Precise magnesium isotope analyses of high-K and low-Mg rocks by MC-ICP-MS</title><secondary-title>Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry</full-title></periodical><pages>940-953</pages><volume>34</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c9ja00002j</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study presents a chemical protocol for the separation of Mg that is particularly adapted for diverse igneous rock samples, especially for high-K and low-Mg rocks. This protocol is based on a combination of three procedures: the removal of K from the samples using the precipitation procedure, followed by the separation of Fe and Ca using 2 mL of AG50W-X12 cation exchange resin, and finally the removal of Al, Ti, Na, and Fe elements using 0.5 mL of AG50W-X12 cation exchange resin. The effect of acidity and concentration mismatch as well as the matrix effect were rigorously evaluated using Nu Plasma II MC-ICP-MS with a wet plasma mode. The δ26Mg mean values of the GSB and Alfa Mg standard solutions are -2.05 ± 0.05‰ (2 standard deviation (2s), n = 106) and -3.91 ± 0.04‰ (2s, n = 51), respectively, which serve as in-house Mg standards in the State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics (SKLCD). The average δ26Mg value of one multi-elemental Mg standard GSB-1, made by adopting GSB with matrix elements, agrees well with the recommended value after precipitation and chromatographic separation. The long-term reproducibility, assessed by repeated measurements of Mg standard solutions and reference materials (RMs), is ±0.06‰. The robustness of our method is further assessed by the replicated analyses of fifteen rock standards and olivine grains with large variations in MgO and K2O content. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065517203&amp;doi=10.1039%2fc9ja00002j&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=537260ad2c7672aa2fe94c1aaaca9684</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brezgin, S.</author><author>Kostyusheva, A.</author><author>Bayurova, E.</author><author>Gordeychuk, I.</author><author>Isaguliants, M.</author><author>Goptar, I.</author><author>Nikiforova, A.</author><author>Smirnov, V.</author><author>Volchkova, E.</author><author>Glebe, D.</author><author>Kostyushev, D.</author><author>Chulanov, V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replenishment of hepatitis B virus cccDNA pool is restricted by baseline expression of host restriction factors in vitro</title><secondary-title>Microorganisms</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microorganisms</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/microorganisms7110533</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major cause of viral persistence in patients with chronic HBV infection. Understanding the mechanisms underlying stability and persistence of HBV cccDNA in hepatocytes is critical for developing novel therapeutics and managing chronic hepatitis B. In this study, we observed an unexpected increase in HBV cccDNA levels upon suppression of transcription by de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and uncovered additional mechanisms potentially involved in HBV cccDNA maintenance. Methods: HBV-expressing cell lines were transfected with a DNMT3A-expressing plasmid. Real-time PCR and HBsAg assays were used to assess the HBV replication rate. Cell cycling was analyzed by fluorescent cell sorting. CRISPR/Cas9 was utilized to abrogate expression of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. Alterations in the expression of target genes were measured by real-time PCR. Results: Similar to previous studies, HBV replication induced DNMT3A expression, which in turn, led to reduced HBV transcription but elevated HBV cccDNA levels (4-to 6-fold increase). Increased levels of HBV cccDNA were not related to cell cycling, as DNMT3A accelerated proliferation of infected cells and could not contribute to HBV cccDNA expansion by arresting cells in a quiescent state. At the same time, DNMT3A suppressed transcription of innate immunity factors including cytidine deaminases APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated silencing of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B transcription had minor effects on HBV transcription, but significantly increased HBV cccDNA levels, similar to DNMT3A. In an attempt to further analyze the detrimental effects of HBV and DNMT3A on infected cells, we visualized γ-H2AX foci and demonstrated that HBV inflicts and DNMT3A aggravates DNA damage, possibly by downregulating DNA damage response factors. Additionally, suppression of HBV replication by DNMT3A may be related to reduced ATM/ATR expression. Conclusion: Formation and maintenance of HBV cccDNA pools may be partially suppressed by the baseline expression of host inhibitory factors including APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. HBV inflicts DNA damage both directly and by inducing DNMT3A expression. © 2019 by the authors.

This hypothesis rests on the premise that virulence is an unavoidable and increasing cost because the parasite uses host resources to replicate. This cost associated with replication ultimately results in a deceleration in transmission rate because increasing within-host replication increases host mortality. Empirical tests of predictions of the hypothesis have found mixed support, which cast doubt about its overall generalizability. To quantitatively address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis of 29 empirical studies, after reviewing over 6000 published papers, addressing the four core relationships between (1) virulence and recovery rate, (2) within-host replication rate and virulence, (3) within-host replication and transmission rate, and (4) virulence and transmission rate. We found strong support for an increasing relationship between replication and virulence, and replication and transmission. Yet, it is still uncertain if these relationships generally decelerate due to high within-study variability. There was insufficient data to quantitatively test the other two core relationships predicted by the theory. Overall, the results suggest that the current empirical evidence provides partial support for the trade-off hypothesis, but more work remains to be done. © 2019 The Author(s).

Objective: To identify families of experiments that used meta-analysis, to investigate their methods for effect size construction and aggregation, and to assess the reproducibility and validity of their results. Method: We performed a systematic review (SR) of papers reporting families of experiments in high quality software engineering journals, that attempted to apply meta-analysis. We attempted to reproduce the reported meta-analysis results using the descriptive statistics and also investigated the validity of the meta-analysis process. Results: Out of 13 identified primary studies, we reproduced only five. Seven studies could not be reproduced. One study which was correctly analyzed could not be reproduced due to rounding errors. When we were unable to reproduce results, we provide revised meta-analysis results. To support reproducibility of analyses presented in our paper, it is complemented by the reproducer R package. Conclusions: Meta-analysis is not well understood by software engineering researchers. To support novice researchers, we present recommendations for reporting and meta-analyzing families of experiments and a detailed example of how to analyze a family of 4-group crossover experiments. © 2019, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069906101&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10664-019-09747-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f1c28babd76afd983fdea82af6677d98</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raposo, J.V.</author><author>Sarmento, D.J.D.S.</author><author>Pinto, R.B.D.S.</author><author>Lopes, A.O.</author><author>Gallottini, M.</author><author>Tozetto-Mendoza, T.R.</author><author>Braz-Silva, P.H.</author><author>de Paula, V.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Longitudinal study on oral shedding of human betaherpesviruses 6 and 7 in renal transplant recipients reveals active replication</title><secondary-title>Journal of Oral Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Oral Microbiology</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/20002297.2020.1785801</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Backgroung: Roseolovirus latency and persistence in salivary glands that are frequently reactivated after renal transplantation to cause infection have been reported. However, limited information is available on the persistence and excretion of HHV-6 and HHV-7 during and after transplant. Methods: 32 renal transplant recipients were followed up before (T1) and after transplant (T2 and T3) and viral replication (via assessment of mRNA) in oral fluid samples investigated. Roseolovirus DNA was detected and quantified via multiplex qPCR. For evaluation of mRNA replication, positive samples were subjected to nested RT-PCR. Results: Viral replication of HHV-7 was significantly increased during T3 (72.9%), compared to the pre-transplant period T1 (25%; McNemar Test, p= 0.001). Analysis of the viral replicative to quantitative ratio disclosed ahigher number of DNA copies (&gt;106) in positive cases of replication (p &lt; 0.001). Astrong positive correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.781; p&lt; 0.001) was evident between viral quantities of Roseoloviruses. Conclusion: Our findings consistently suggest that the salivary gland is an important site of active and persistent infection by roseoloviruses. In view of the increasing problem of Roseoloviruses, pre- and post-transplantation, viral surveillance and monitoring of active replication are pivotal steps for effective screening and treatment of renal transplant patients. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Visual performance looks at the perception of standard elementary images, such as gratings, by different observers or by a single observer in different visual conditions; image quality looks at the perception of variations of the same complex scene by a standard observer. - Visual performance, for which Barten proposed a model in 1999, is studying threshold responses in visual perception. For image quality, on the other hand, indexes are built which must evaluate responses to a variety of suprathreshold visual characteristics, attempting to give results as close as possible to human visual perception. - In audiovisual field, all the configurations approved by the creative team must be reproduced in the final viewing. This cannot be measured by visual performance or image quality indexes. A third approach is needed. This may be called perceptual reproduction quality assessment. Visual perception assessment is not measuring defects, per se; it is built to evaluate the perceptual effectiveness of a given scene coding through a given reproduction technology. - It is only dependent on the number of configurations being reproduced by a given theater system relatively to the various configurations reproduced and approved in the review room. As such, it is a statistical measure. It is in fact similar to the definition of relative entropy. One important fact is that this evaluation must include a model of visual perception. - This paper shows how relative entropy, and entropy loss, can be estimated while taking into account the coding transform, the projector performances, maximum light and the characteristics of human visual system. - This scheme is carried easily for monochromatic content. Color, trichromacy, is quite challenging. The size of configurations goes from 212 to 236, around 6 billion configurations. Calculation and memory requirements are huge. Non-linearities are adding complexity leading to calculation of an upper limit only of entropy loss. - Presentation of results is also a challenge. One way to solve this is to process separately lightness and chromatic information. - In summary the main arguments in this paper are: - • Besides image quality and visual performance there is a need for perceptual reproduction quality assessment - • Entropy is the proper statistical estimator to evaluate the perceptual reproduction quality - • Color reproduction quality estimation requires processing lightness and chromatic attributes separately. © 2018 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063075500&amp;doi=10.5594%2fM001837&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=be3b1d13d24c195dcca7dc9eb0f31ab8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Konkol, M.</author><author>Kray, C.</author><author>Pfeiffer, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computational reproducibility in geoscientific papers: Insights from a series of studies with geoscientists and a reproduction study</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Geographical Information Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Geographical Information Science</full-title></periodical><pages>408-429</pages><volume>33</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/13658816.2018.1508687</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science and thus for geographic research as well. However, studies in other disciplines such as biology have shown that published work is rarely reproducible. To assess the state of reproducibility, specifically computational reproducibility (i.e. rerunning the analysis of a paper using the original code), in geographic research, we asked geoscientists about this topic using three methods: a survey (n = 146), interviews (n = 9), and a focus group (n = 5). We asked participants about their understanding of open reproducible research (ORR), how much it is practiced, and what obstacles hinder ORR. We found that participants had different understandings of ORR and that there are several obstacles for authors and readers (e.g. effort, lack of openness). Then, in order to complement the subjective feedback from the participants, we tried to reproduce the results of papers that use spatial statistics to address problems in the geosciences. We selected 41 open access papers from Copernicus and Journal of Statistical Software and executed the R code. In doing so, we identified several technical issues and specific issues with the reproduced figures depicting the results. Based on these findings, we propose guidelines for authors to overcome the issues around reproducibility in the computational geosciences. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

In this work, we present a mathematical model embodying the interaction between tumour cells and virus particles engineered to infect and destroy cancerous tissue. To quantify the effectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy, we conduct a local stability analysis and bifurcation analysis of our model. In the absence of tumour growth or viral decay, the model predicts that oncolytic virotherapy will successfully eliminate the tumour cell population for a large proportion of initial conditions. In comparison, for growing tumours and decaying viral particles there are no stable equilibria in the model; however, oscillations emerge for certain regions in our parameter space. We investigate how the period and amplitude of oscillations depend on tumour growth and viral decay. We find that higher tumour replication rates result in longer periods between oscillations and lower amplitudes for uninfected tumour cells. From our analysis, we conclude that oncolytic viruses can reduce growing tumours into a stable oscillatory state, but are insufficient to completely eradicate them. We propose that it is only with the addition of other anti-cancer agents that tumour eradication may be achieved by oncolytic virus. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Generalization errors encompass when the learner should extend the use of a newly taught behavior to other contexts but does not (under-generalization), as well as when he or she should not use the newly established behavior in new contexts but does (over-generalization). This study was designed to evaluate the generalization errors of a preschooler with ASD. Following an intervention in which the participant was taught to request assistance with difficult tasks using a continuous reinforcement schedule, generalization gradients across levels of task difficulty were implemented to examine patterns of generalization. Initial results showed over-generalization of assistance requests and corresponding reductions in independent (the absence of any instructional prompts) task completion across all levels of task difficulty. A final phase involving competing schedules of reinforcement for assistance requests and independent work with video modeling led to improved conditional use of assistance requests.

Earlier studies hypothesized that resistance affecting the degree of host damage, as measured by the percentage of leaf area covered by STB lesions, is distinct from resistance that affects pathogen reproduction, as measured by the density of pycnidia produced within lesions. We tested this hypothesis using a collection of 335 elite European winter wheat cultivars that was naturally infected by a diverse population of Zymoseptoria tritici in a replicated field experiment. We used automated image analysis of 21,420 scanned wheat leaves to obtain quantitative measures of conditional STB intensity that were precise, objective, and reproducible. These measures allowed us to explicitly separate resistance affecting host damage from resistance affecting pathogen reproduction, enabling us to confirm that these resistance traits are largely independent. The cultivar rankings based on host damage were different from the rankings based on pathogen reproduction, indicating that the two forms of resistance should be considered separately in breeding programs aiming to increase STB resistance. We hypothesize that these different forms of resistance are under separate genetic control, enabling them to be recombined to form new cultivars that are highly resistant to STB. We found a significant correlation between rankings based on automated image analysis and rankings based on traditional visual scoring, suggesting that image analysis can complement conventional measurements of STB resistance, based largely on host damage, while enabling a much more precise measure of pathogen reproduction. We showed that measures of pathogen reproduction early in the growing season were the best predictors of host damage late in the growing season, illustrating the importance of breeding for resistance that reduces pathogen reproduction in order to minimize yield losses caused by STB. These data can already be used by breeding programs to choose wheat cultivars that are broadly resistant to naturally diverse Z. tritici populations according to the different classes of resistance. © 2018 The American Phytopathological Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046018301&amp;doi=10.1094%2fPHYTO-04-17-0163-R&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=228135caf91575c3096113517620acd0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dolzhenko, R.A.</author><author>Karpilianskii, V.A.</author><author>Hady, R.A.</author><author>Didenko, A.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Young scientists' motivation for research activity in Russian regional universities</title><secondary-title>Obrazovanie i Nauka</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Obrazovanie i Nauka</full-title></periodical><pages>122-153</pages><volume>21</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.17853/1994-5639-2019-9-122-153</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction: In modern Russian science, there is a contradiction between the need for workforce rejuvenation and the orientation of the existing system on established scientists, whose interest in conducting breakthrough research has been weakened. Most promising young researchers are deprived of the freedom to independently choose the field of application of their abilities; also, scientists do not have access to resources to solve complex innovative problems and cannot directly represent the products of their work to those people, who may need them. As a rule, young scientists' research interests are usually limited by the agenda dictated by scientific supervisors; the list of grant contests available for participation is extremely small; formalised requirements of postgraduate studies and thesis defence are conservative and full of outdated rules. In particular, all the above-mentioned problems are evident in the regions. The aim of the work is to highlight young scientists' (e.g. employees of provincial scientific and educational organisations) motivational factors influencing the research on relevant topics and conditions for success in such research activities. Methodology and research methods: The methodological framework is based on the systemic approach, which involves a comparative analysis method and a hypothetical-deductive method. The empirical material was collected through questionnaire and expert surveys. The cluster sampling involved 148 young scientists (Doctors of Sciences under 40 years old, Candidates of Sciences under 35 years old, postgraduate students and researchers without a degree under 30 years old). In-depth interviews were conducted with the most successful respondents (N = 20) to comprehensively assess the factors of their professional activity, since it is the leaders, who primarily determine the effectiveness of functioning system. Results and scientific novelty. The motivation of a young scientist is considered as a key factor in the productivity of his or her research behaviour, which, in turn, depends on the needs of the individual and the degree of his or her satisfaction with self-realisation in the process of targeted scientific search. The authors formulated a number of hypotheses regarding the motivation of young scientists and the reasons for the decreased scientific activity in recent years based on the analysis of statistics on the state and dynamics of research activities in Russia as a whole, in regions and in individual institutions; on the comparative indicators of such activity and the benchmarking of its best practices beforehand, in the course of the pilot study (in February-March 2018). The authors developed and validated survey tools in order to test the assumptions and to check the final list of assumptions, which included a questionnaire and a list of expert assessments. The generalisation of results based on the questionnaire and the interviews of young researchers made it possible to specify their motivational features and to identify the structural core. There is a clear discrepancy between the desire of respondents to engage in research and the opportunities provided at the state and regional levels, and in the scientific and educational organisations. Traditional support mechanisms for young scientists do not allow using their research and personal potential adequately. The lack of due attention to young scientific personnel will have long-term negative consequences not only for the Russian science, but also for the entire production and economic sector of the country. Practical significance. The proposals and recommendations are made to adjust the management of research activities in the regions and to revise the research policy in order to implement the Strategy of Scientific and Technological Development of the Russian Federation. © 2019 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

DNA replication results in demethylated DNA, topological changes, removal of proteins and recruitment of proteins to promoters. One or more of these effects of DNA replication may facilitate late gene transcription. Using 5-azacytidine to promote demethylation of DNA, we demonstrate that late gene transcription cannot be rescued by DNA demethylation. Late gene transcription precedes significant increases in DNA copy number, indicating that increased template numbers also do not contribute to the linkage between replication and late gene transcription. By using serial, timed blockade of DNA replication and measurement of late gene mRNA accumulation, we demonstrate that late gene transcription requires ongoing DNA replication. Consistent with these findings, blocking DNA replication led to dissolution of DNA replication complexes which also contain RNA polymerase II and BGLF4, an EBV protein required for transcription of several late genes. These data indicate that ongoing DNA replication maintains integrity of a replication-transcription complex which is required for recruitment and retention of factors necessary for late gene transcription. © 2018 Public Library of Science.

As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p &lt; 2.2 × 10−16), supporting the value of phenotype-driven gene prioritization in diagnostic sequence interpretation. To assess the generalizability, we replicated this finding on an independent EHR dataset of ten individuals with a positive diagnosis from a different institution. We then assessed the broader utility by examining two additional EHR datasets, including 31 individuals who were suspected of having a Mendelian disease and underwent different types of genetic testing and 20 individuals with positive diagnoses of specific Mendelian etiologies of chronic kidney disease from exome sequencing. Finally, through several retrospective case studies, we demonstrated how combined analyses of genotype data and deep phenotype data from EHRs can expedite genetic diagnoses. In summary, EHR-Phenolyzer leverages EHR narratives to automate phenotype-driven analysis of clinical exomes or genomes, facilitating the broader implementation of genomic medicine. © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048729565&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.ajhg.2018.05.010&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=23ad4daf2f8932dca1c207bd04990093</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>dos Santos, F.P.</author><author>Ribeiro, L.S.F.</author><author>Ponti, M.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization of feature embeddings transferred from different video anomaly detection domains</title><secondary-title>Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation</full-title></periodical><pages>407-416</pages><volume>60</volume><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvcir.2019.02.035</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Detecting anomalous activity in video surveillance often suffers from limited availability of training data. Transfer learning may close this gap, allowing to use existing annotated data from some source domain. However, analyzing the source feature space in terms of its potential for transfer of learning to another context is still to be investigated. This paper reports a study on video anomaly detection, focusing on the analysis of feature embeddings of pre-trained CNNs with the use of novel cross-domain generalization measures that allow to study how source features generalize for different target video domains. This generalization analysis represents not only a theoretical approach, can be useful in practice as a path to understand which datasets allow better transfer of knowledge. Our results confirm this, achieving better anomaly detectors for video frames and allowing analysis of transfer learning's positive and negative aspects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063036595&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jvcir.2019.02.035&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bddd0b4d4a0e7b1413fe6c0549be75f2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Contina, J.B.</author><author>Dandurand, L.M.</author><author>Knudsen, G.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Predictive Risk Model Analysis of the Potato Cyst Nematode Globodera pallida in Idaho</title><secondary-title>Plant Disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant Disease</full-title></periodical><pages>3117-3128</pages><volume>103</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1094/PDIS-04-19-0717-RE</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Globodera pallida is a major nematode pest of potato (Solanum tuberosum) and is of great economic importance for the potato industry. Assessing potato yield loss caused by the Idaho G. pallida population under field conditions was not performed due to its quarantine status in Idaho, where it is prohibited by regulatory statutes to grow potato in any infested fields. The experimental data came from three trials that were conducted under greenhouse conditions. A predictive risk model analysis was performed to: (i) determine the effect of the Idaho population of G. pallida on potato yield; (ii) estimate reproduction rate from different initial nematode densities; and (iii) simulate potato yield losses in Idaho field conditions by integrating the coefficients of potato yield into the SUBSTOR-DSSAT crop simulation model. Experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions using five initial G. pallida soil infestation levels (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 eggs/g soil). The coefficients of potato yield achieved under each initial nematode density were integrated into the SUBSTOR-DSSAT potato growth simulation model. The model showed that tuber weight reached a maximum yield of 96 ton/ha in noninfested soil. Based on the greenhouse trials, the model predicted a minimum yield of 12 and 58 ton/ha in trial 1 and trial 2/3 respectively, when initial nematode density was 80 eggs/g soil. In trial 1, tuber weight was significantly reduced by 44% at 40 eggs/g soil and by 87% at 80 eggs/g soil, and 20% at 40 eggs/g soil and by 39% at 80 eggs/g soil in trial 2/3. The outputs of this study should facilitate common understanding between regulators, policymakers, and potato growers on the challenges and opportunities for controlling this economically important pest in Idaho. © 2019 The American Phytopathological Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075812621&amp;doi=10.1094%2fPDIS-04-19-0717-RE&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7cb087294e967dd3a26a64d13dff9e8b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sidani, S.</author><author>Fox, M.</author><author>El-Masri, M.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Guidance for the Reporting of an Intervention's Theory</title><secondary-title>Research and Theory for Nursing Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research and Theory for Nursing Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>35-48</pages><volume>34</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1891/1541-6577.34.1.35</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Interventions in clinical trials should be clearly and completely described to inform their evaluation in replication studies and implementation in clinical practice. Guidelines were developed to standardize the reporting of interventions, but failed to provide guidance on reporting of the theory of interventions. Further, space constraints imposed by many research journals often limit the comprehensive description of both the theoretical and operational aspects of interventions. Purpose: To address these gaps, we propose that the theory of interventions be published in separate conceptual papers that would provide an in-depth description of the health problem targeted by an intervention, the components comprising an intervention, the causal mechanism responsible for an intervention's impact on the outcomes, and the conditions necessary for the proper implementation and the effectiveness of an intervention. Implications: Such papers would assist in the critical appraisal of the adequacy, implementation, and evaluation of interventions. A description of the theory of interventions clarifies to health professionals what the interventions are about, who is likely to benefit from the interventions, how the interventions work and under what context. © Copyright 2020 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077881629&amp;doi=10.1891%2f1541-6577.34.1.35&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b985bf93456cc17dec3d7e6152c4ef8b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Y.</author><author>Li, J.C.-H.</author><author>Liu, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Limited usefulness of capture procedure and capture percentage for evaluating reproducibility in psychological science</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Psychology</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>SEP</number><issue>SEP</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01657</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In psychological science, there is an increasing concern regarding the reproducibility of scientific findings. For instance, Replication Project: Psychology (Open Science Collaboration, 2015) found that the proportion of successful replication in psychology was 41%. This proportion was calculated based on Cumming and Maillardet (2006) widely employed capture procedure (CPro) and capture percentage (CPer). Despite the popularity of CPro and CPer, we believe that using them may lead to an incorrect conclusion of (a) successful replication when the population effect sizes in the original and replicated studies are different; and (b) unsuccessful replication when the population effect sizes in the original and replicated studies are identical but their sample sizes are different. Our simulation results show that the performances of CPro and CPer become biased, such that researchers can easily make a wrong conclusion of successful/unsuccessful replication. Implications of these findings are considered in the conclusion. © 2018 Cheng, Li and Liu.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053139775&amp;doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2018.01657&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4270d475f4bdda98749ce55c1ec5bd7b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berg, C.N.</author><author>Sinha, N.</author><author>Gluck, M.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ABCA7 risk genotype diminishes the neuroprotective value of aerobic fitness in healthy older African Americans</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><number>APR</number><issue>APR</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fnagi.2019.00073</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although the association of ABCA7 risk variants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been established worldwide, its effect size on the relative odds of being diagnosed with AD is significantly higher in African Americans. Across ethnicities, two common ABCA7 loci (rs115550680 and rs3764650) have been confirmed to increase the risk of AD. While ABCA7 rs115550680 has been linked to the development of late-onset AD in African Americans, no association between ABCA7 variant rs3764650 and AD has been found in this population. In order to elucidate the influence of ABCA7 rs3764650 on AD risk in African Americans, we sought to investigate the relationship between this variant, aerobic fitness, and cognition. The present study tested the hypothesis that in African Americans, ABCA7 rs3764650 confers an indirect risk for AD via its interaction with aerobic fitness, a modifiable lifestyle factor known to attenuate AD-related neuropathology. In a case-control sample of 100 healthy African Americans, we observed that ABCA7 rs3764650 genotype modulates the association between aerobic fitness and a cognitive assessment of generalization following rule learning. For carriers of the non-risk genotype, higher levels of aerobic fitness were significantly associated with fewer generalization errors, while carriers of the risk genotype did not show any relationship between aerobic fitness and generalization. Our findings imply that ABCA7 rs3764650 risk genotype may diminish the neuroprotective effects of aerobic fitness, and, they suggest differing risk patterns between cognitive decline and fitness by ABCA7 genotype. Thus, in African Americans the interactive effects of ABCA7 rs3764650 and aerobic fitness likely compound overall ABCA7-related AD risk, and may contribute to health disparities whereby African Americans are at a higher risk for dementia, with double the prevalence of AD.

We include of parameterizable visualization generation services, thus separating the visualization implementation from study design and execution. This enables experimenters to design and run multiple experiments on the same visualization service in parallel, replicate experiments, and compare different visualization services quickly. The system supports the range from simple questionnaires to visualization-specific interaction techniques as well as automated task generation based on dynamic sampling of parameter spaces. We feature two examples to demonstrate our service-based approach.

The user has firstly to formulate a query that expresses his/her needs. This query may appear in textual form as in semantic retrieval (SR), in visual example form as in query by visual example (QBVE), or as a combination of these two forms named query by semantic example (QBSE). The focus of this paper lies in the techniques of analyzing queries composed of multiple semantic examples. This is a very challenging task due to the different interpretations that can be drawn from the same query. To solve such a problem, we introduce a model based on Bayesian generalization. In cognitive science, Bayesian generalization, which is the base of most works in literature, is a method that tries to find, in one hierarchy of concepts, the parent concept of a given set of concepts. In addition and instead of using one single concept hierarchy, we propose a generalization so it can be used with multiple hierarchies where each one has a different semantic context and contains several abstraction levels. Our method consists in finding the optimal generalization by, firstly, determining the appropriate concept hierarchy, and then determining the appropriate level of generalization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method, which uses multiple hierarchies, yields better results than those using only one single hierarchy. © 2019 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

At present, little is known about the defense mechanisms of the PWN, which limits PWD control. Although autophagy plays an important role in the physiological and pathological processes of eukaryotes, its significance in the PWN remains unknown. In this study, we prepared an anti-BxATG8 polyclonal antibody and identified two PWN autophagy marker proteins: BxATG8-I and BxATG8-II. By western blot analysis, we found that the ratio of BxATG8-II to BxATG8-I, which represents autophagic activity, was decreased significantly when samples were treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. As such, we were able to successfully detect and quantify autophagic activity in the PWN. Thereafter, we investigated the effects of low and high temperatures on PWN growth and reproduction. The results revealed that feeding rate, reproduction rate, and mobility decreased at 15°C and increased at 35°C. By contrast, autophagic activity was high at 15°C and low at 35°C, suggesting that the PWN regulates autophagic activity in response to changes in temperature to maintain physiological homeostasis. When autophagy was inhibited at 15°C, feeding rate, reproductive rate, and mobility declined further, indicating that autophagy is crucial for PWN growth and reproduction at low temperature. These results indicate that autophagy in the PWN is an important response mechanism to temperature changes. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019..</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070991644&amp;doi=10.1093%2fabbs%2fgmz068&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dd7d0a72ea063067145ea39f6a913511</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McEwen-Smith, L.</author><author>Price, M.J.</author><author>Fleming, G.</author><author>Swanwick, T.</author><author>Hirsch, C.</author><author>Yahyouche, A.</author><author>Ward, J.</author><author>Buckley, S.</author><author>Shamim, A.</author><author>Paudyal, V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>National recruitment scheme for pre-registration pharmacist training in England and Wales: A mixed method evaluation of experiences of applicant pharmacy students</title><secondary-title>BMC Medical Education</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Medical Education</full-title></periodical><volume>19</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12909-019-1883-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: A national pre-registration pharmacist training recruitment scheme, which replaces local recruitment models, was introduced in England and Wales in 2017. The national recruitment system allows pharmacy students to apply for the 52 weeks training programmes (mandatory requirement for registration as a pharmacist), through a single application system prior to undertaking a nationally administered assessment. This study aimed to explore experiences of pharmacy students on the national recruitment scheme, particularly their views on the selection methodology, application process, and offer outcomes. Methods: This mixed method study involved a) an online survey of all (approximate n = 2800) year 4 (final year of MPharm degree) pharmacy students in England and Wales and b) a qualitative focus group with four students. The study population was eligible to participate in the 2017/18 national recruitment scheme. Survey respondents were invited to participate in a focus group. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and inferential analysis. Qualitative data were analysed using the framework technique. Participation was voluntary. Ethical approval from University of Birmingham was obtained. Results: A total of 307 completed surveys were returned (approximate response rate 11%). Respondents were generally satisfied with the application process and commended the fairness of the selection methodology and convenience in allowing them to apply to multiple training providers. Most survey respondents (n = 181, 72.9%) were either satisfied or highly satisfied with the training programme they were offered based on their assessment performances. Three themes and eight sub-themes obtained from the analysis of over 200 open comments data from the survey and transcript of a focus group with four participants. Results suggested the need to widen the timeframe available for applicants to shortlist their preferred employers, improve the method of programme listing in the application system, and consideration of prior achievements including academic performances and placement experiences to be included in the selection methodology. Conclusions: Experiences of pharmacy students on the national recruitment scheme suggest that respondents considered the selection methodology to be fair. Student engagement and satisfaction with the recruitment system can be maximised through improved listing of employers and widening the timescales for students to shortlist their preferred employers during application process. Inclusion of University achievements in the selection methodology will require consideration of evidence based approaches. Low response rate limits generalisation of findings. © 2019 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076088006&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12909-019-1883-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=090b844cd644bfdd6631959f2bcb76b3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holroyd-Leduc, J.</author><author>Harris, C.</author><author>Hamid, J.S.</author><author>Ewusie, J.E.</author><author>Quirk, J.</author><author>Osiowy, K.</author><author>Moore, J.E.</author><author>Khan, S.</author><author>Liu, B.</author><author>Straus, S.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scaling-up implementation in community hospitals: A multisite interrupted time series design of the Mobilization of Vulnerable Elders (MOVE) program in Alberta</title><secondary-title>BMC Geriatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Geriatrics</full-title></periodical><volume>19</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12877-019-1311-z</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: As the population ages, older hospitalized patients are at increased risk for hospital-acquired morbidity. The Mobilization of Vulnerable Elders (MOVE) program is an evidence-informed early mobilization intervention that was previously evaluated in Ontario, Canada. The program was effective at improving mobilization rates and decreasing length of stay in academic hospitals. The aim of this study was to scale-up the program and conduct a replication study evaluating the impact of the evidence-informed mobilization intervention on various units in community hospitals within a different Canadian province. Methods: The MOVE program was tailored to the local context at four community hospitals in Alberta, Canada. The study population was patients aged 65 years and older who were admitted to medicine, surgery, rehabilitation and intensive care units between July 2015 and July 2016. The primary outcome was patient mobilization measured by conducting visual audits twice a week, three times a day. The secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay obtained from hospital administrative data, and perceptions of the intervention assessed through a qualitative assessment. Using an interrupted time series design, the intervention was evaluated over three time periods (pre-intervention, during, and post-intervention). Results: A total of 3601 patients [mean age 80.1 years (SD = 8.4 years)] were included in the overall analysis. There was a significant increase in mobilization at the end of the intervention period compared to pre-intervention, with 6% more patients out of bed (95% confidence interval (CI) 1, 11; p-value = 0.0173). A decreasing trend in median length of stay was observed, where patients on average stayed an estimated 3.59 fewer days (95%CI -15.06, 7.88) during the intervention compared to pre-intervention period. Conclusions: MOVE is a low-cost, effective and adaptable intervention that improves mobilization in older hospitalized patients. This intervention has been replicated and scaled up across various units and hospital settings. © 2019 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074151427&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12877-019-1311-z&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=92dea871a1ed9bb281ec036370fc5461</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kelly, C.D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rate and success of study replication in ecology and evolution</title><secondary-title>PeerJ</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PeerJ</full-title></periodical><volume>2019</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.7717/peerj.7654</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The recent replication crisis has caused several scientific disciplines to self-reflect on the frequency with which they replicate previously published studies and to assess their success in such endeavours. The rate of replication, however, has yet to be assessed for ecology and evolution. Here, I survey the open-access ecology and evolution literature to determine how often ecologists and evolutionary biologists replicate, or at least claim to replicate, previously published studies. I found that approximately 0.023% of ecology and evolution studies are described by their authors as replications. Two of the 11 original-replication study pairs provided sufficient statistical detail for three effects so as to permit a formal analysis of replication success. Replicating authors correctly concluded that they replicated an original effect in two cases; in the third case, my analysis suggests that the finding by the replicating authors was consistent with the original finding, contrary the conclusion of "replication failure" by the authors.

While knowing shape names is considered important for school-readiness, many children do not understand the defining features of shapes until well into elementary school (Satlow &amp; Newcombe, 1998). One reason is likely that they do not encounter enough variety in the shapes they see (Resnick, Verdine, Golinkoff, &amp; Hirsh-Pasek, 2016). The present study observed 60 parents and their 3-year-old children during play with geometric toys, exploring how spatial language varied with the nature of the shape-toy set (canonical shapes versus a mix of canonical and unusual or less-canonical variants) and whether geometric shapes were presented as tangible, traditional toys or shown on a touchscreen tablet app. Although children in the app condition heard more shape names than the other conditions due to the language produced by the app itself, children used more overall words and more spatial language with tangible toys that included varied shapes. In addition, parents used more shape names with sons than with daughters and tended to adjust their use of spatial language more in response to varied shape sets with boys, although these findings need replication to evaluate generality. These data suggest that including non-canonical shapes in tangible shape toys may provide a low-cost, high-impact way of refining adult-child interactions that might facilitate children's early geometric knowledge. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047217664&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.ecresq.2018.03.015&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e05b7b7b0e9641859c86afac1a249d4d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Munoz-Organero, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Outlier Detection in Wearable Sensor Data for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Based on DRNNs</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title></periodical><pages>74422-74436</pages><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2921096</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wearable sensors provide a user-friendly and non-intrusive mechanism to extract user-related data that paves the way to the development of personalized applications. Within those applications, human activity recognition (HAR) plays an important role in the characterization of the user context. Outlier detection methods focus on finding anomalous data samples that are likely to have been generated by a different mechanism. This paper combines outlier detection and HAR by introducing a novel algorithm that is able both to detect information from secondary activities inside the main activity and to extract data segments of a particular sub-activity from a different activity. Several machine learning algorithms have been previously used in the area of HAR based on the analysis of the time sequences generated by wearable sensors. Deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) have proven to be optimally adapted to the sequential characteristics of wearable sensor data in previous studies. A DRNN-based algorithm is proposed in this paper for outlier detection in HAR. The results are validated both for intra- and inter-subject cases and both for outlier detection and sub-activity recognition using two different datasets. A first dataset comprising 4 major activities (walking, running, climbing up, and down) from 15 users is used to train and validate the proposal. Intra-subject outlier detection is able to detect all major outliers in the walking activity in this dataset, while inter-subject outlier detection only fails for one participant executing the activity in a peculiar way. Sub-activity detection has been validated by finding out and extracting walking segments present in the other three activities in this dataset. A second dataset using four different users, a different setting and different sensor devices is used to assess the generalization of results. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068343659&amp;doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2921096&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=958ac70b35a5aa22b5128e35b0e46e23</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schimmack, U.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A meta-psychological perspective on the decade of replication failures in social psychology.</title><secondary-title>Canadian Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>364-376</pages><volume>61</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1037/cap0000246</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Bem’s (2011) article triggered a string of replication failures in social psychology. A major replication project found that only 25% of results in social psychology could be replicated. I examine various explanations for this low replication rate and found most of them lacking in empirical support. I then provide evidence that the use of questionable research practices accounts for this result. Using z-curve and a representative sample of focal hypothesis tests, I find that the expected replication rate for social psychology is between 20% and 45%. I argue that quantifying replicability can provide an incentive to use good research practices and to invest more resources in studies that produce replicable results. The replication crisis in social psychology provides important lessons for other disciplines in psychology that have avoided to take a closer look at their research practices. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Public Significance Statement—This article examines explanations for the low replicability of social psychology. Using a new statistical method, z-curve, it is shown that low statistical power and selective reporting of significant results are the main factor. As a result, original results in social psychology journals report inflated effect sizes that cannot be replicated. To improve the credibility of social psychology, researchers must increase statistical power and disclose nonsignificant results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)L’article de BEM (2011) a déclenché une série d’échecs de reproduction en psychologie sociale. Un important projet de réplication a révélé que seulement 25 % des résultats en psychologie sociale pouvaient être reproduits. J’ai examiné diverses explications pour ce faible taux de reproduction et j’ai trouvé que la plupart d’entre elles manquaient de soutien empirique. Je fournis ensuite la preuve que l’utilisation de pratiques de recherche douteuses tient compte de ce résultat. En utilisant la courbe Z et un échantillon représentatif des tests d’hypothèse focale, j’ai trouvé que le taux de reproduction attendu pour la psychologie sociale se situe entre 20 et 45 %. Je crois que la quantification de la reproductibilité peut inciter à utiliser de bonnes pratiques de recherche et à investir davantage de ressources dans des études qui produisent des résultats reproductibles. La crise de reproduction en psychologie sociale offre des leçons importantes pour d’autres disciplines de psychologie qui ont évité de s’intéresser de plus près à leurs pratiques de recherche.

Using pooled analyses, we examined whether this association applies to populations from different geographic regions and population subgroups with varying risks for PC, including variation in ABO blood type. Data from six case-control studies (cases, n = 2414; controls, n = 4528) in the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4) were analyzed, followed by replication in five nested case-control studies (cases, n = 1268; controls, n = 4215) from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan). Two polymorphisms in the ABO locus (rs505922 and rs8176746) were used to infer participants' blood types. Dietary questionnaire-derived nutrient/food intake was used to compute energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E-DII) scores to assess inflammatory potential of diet. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. Higher E-DII scores, reflecting greater inflammatory potential of diet, were associated with increased PC risk in PanC4 [ORQ5 versus Q1=2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.85-2.61, Ptrend &lt; 0.0001; ORcontinuous = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.17-1.24], and PanScan (ORQ5 versus Q1 = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.92-1.66, Ptrend = 0.008; ORcontinuous = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.15). As expected, genotype-derived non-O blood type was associated with increased PC risk in both the PanC4 and PanScan studies. Stratified analyses of associations between E-DII quintiles and PC by genotype-derived ABO blood type did not show interaction by blood type (Pinteraction = 0.10 in PanC4 and Pinteraction=0.13 in PanScan). The results show that consuming a pro-inflammatory diet and carrying non-O blood type are each individually, but not interactively, associated with increased PC risk. © The Author(s) 2018.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054962963&amp;doi=10.1093%2fcarcin%2fbgy072&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=be63dcfe57e4f73dd33746040ac65d10</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, M.</author><author>Sun, Q.</author><author>Li, S.</author><author>Xu, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalized Hausdorff Distance of Multi-scale Point Group and Its Application in Similarity Measurement</title><secondary-title>Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University</secondary-title><short-title>多尺度点群广义Hausdorff距离及在相似性度量中的应用</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University</full-title></periodical><pages>885-891</pages><volume>44</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.13203/j.whugis20170305</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Multi-scale point group similarity calculation plays an important role in process control and result evaluation of cartographic generalization.

Microscopy images provide a standardized way to measure the generalization capacity of image classifiers, as we can image the same classes of objects under increasingly divergent, but controlled factors of variation. We created a public dataset of 132,209 images of mouse cells, COOS-7 (Cells Out Of Sample 7-Class). COOS-7 provides a classification setting where four test datasets have increasing degrees of covariate shift: some images are random subsets of the training data, while others are from experiments reproduced months later and imaged by different instruments. We benchmarked a range of classification models using different representations, including transferred neural network features, end-to-end classification with a supervised deep CNN, and features from a self-supervised CNN. While most classifiers perform well on test datasets similar to the training dataset, all classifiers failed to generalize their performance to datasets with greater covariate shifts. These baselines highlight the challenges of covariate shifts in image data, and establish metrics for improving the generalization capacity of image classifiers. © 2019 Neural information processing systems foundation.

This is substantially slower (by about 50%) than the rate in continental Europe. We interpret this result in the framework of a new mathematical model that includes horizontal cultural transmission (acculturation), vertical cultural transmission (interbreeding) and demic diffusion (reproduction and dispersal of farmers). To parametrize the model, we estimate reproduction rates of early farmers using archaeological data (sum-calibrated probabilities for the dates of early Neolithic Scandinavian sites) and use them in a wave-of-advance model for the first time. Comparing the model with the archaeological data, we find that the percentage of the spread rate due to cultural diffusion is below 50% (except for very extreme parameter values, and even for them it is below 54%). This strongly suggests that the spread of the Neolithic in Scandinavia was driven mainly by demic diffusion. This conclusion, obtained from archaeological data, agrees qualitatively with the implications of ancient genetic data, but the latter are yet too few in Scandinavia to produce any quantitative percentage for the spread rate due to cultural diffusion. We also find that, on average, fewer than eight hunter–gatherers were incorporated in the Neolithic communities by each group of 10 pioneering farmers, via horizontal and/or vertical cultural transmission.                          © 2018 The Authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056982478&amp;doi=10.1098%2frsif.2018.0597&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9b551955fc3a093211a2944e16a9dca3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beardsley, M.</author><author>Hernández-Leo, D.</author><author>Ramirez-Melendez, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seeking reproducibility: Assessing a multimodal study of the testing effect</title><secondary-title>Journal of Computer Assisted Learning</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Computer Assisted Learning</full-title></periodical><pages>378-386</pages><volume>34</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jcal.12265</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Low-cost devices have widened the use of multimodal data in experiments providing a more complete picture of behavioural effects. However, the accurate collection and combination of multimodal and behavioural data in a manner that enables reproducibility is challenging and often requires researchers to refine their approaches. This paper presents a direct replication of a multimodal wordlist experiment. Specifically, we use a low-cost Emotiv EPOC® to acquire electrophysiological measures of brain activity to investigate whether retrieval during learning facilitates the encoding of subsequent learning as measured by performance on recall tests and reflected by changes in alpha wave oscillations. Behavioural results of the wordlist experiment were replicated, but physiological results were not.

Innovative payment mechanisms, such as mobile money, could have benefits for recipients. An experimental study suggests that the use of mobile money, Zap delivery, might improve intra-household socio-economic dynamics on Niger. Our replication study evaluates the impact of Zap delivery in contrast to more traditional delivery mechanism. We examined original author´s findings and estimated similar results about increasing household diet diversity without decreasing their durable and nondurable assets. The heterogeneity evaluation by age groups suggests that the Zap delivery had a different impact on older beneficiaries than younger ones.

Identified trials were cross-verified with appropriate published data sources. Comparative accrual sufficiency and rates of race/ethnicity reporting were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with accrual status and race/ethnicity reporting.Results:A total of 326 trials were identified based on our prespecified criteria, of which 63% reported sufficient accrual by time of closure and 58% reported data by race/ethnicity. Nonurological trials were significantly more likely to mention race data than urological trials (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.24-8.55, p = 0.02). Industry sponsored trials were more likely to meet accrual targets than government funded projects (OR 5.44, 95% CI 1.64-18.20, p = 0.001). Although funding source did not influence race reporting, the reported recruitment of participants of African ethnicity was lower in industry sponsored trials (11.49% vs 3.18%, p &lt;0.01). Two-thirds of the studies did not report baseline characteristics by African American race/ethnicity.Conclusions:Insufficient accrual and inadequate race/ethnicity reporting are prevalent issues, limiting interpretation of the results of clinical trials of major solid organ malignancies. Addressing these shortcomings would enhance result validity by raising statistical power and improving the transparency of reporting to better evaluate the generalizability of results. reproduction of this article is prohibited. © 2019 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

In the audiovisual field, all the configurations approved by the creative team must be reproduced in the final viewing. This cannot be measured by visual performance or image quality indexes.A third approach is needed, which may be called perceptual reproduction quality assessment.Visual perception assessment is not measuring defects, per se; it is built to evaluate the perceptual effectiveness of a given scene coding through a given reproduction technology. It is only dependent on the number of configurations being perceived through a given theater system relative to the various configurations reproduced and approved in the review room. As such, it is a statistical measure. It is, in fact, similar to the definition of relative entropy. One important fact is that this evaluation must include a model of visual perception. This paper illustrates how relative entropy and entropy loss can be estimated, while taking into account the coding transform, the projector performances, maximum light, and the characteristics of the human visual system. This scheme works easily for monochromatic content. Color, trichromacy, is quite challenging. The size of configurations goes from 212 to 236, around 6 billion configurations. Calculation and memory requirements are huge. Nonlinearities are adding complexity, leading to calculation of an upper limit only of entropy loss.The presentation of results is also a challenge. One way to solve this is to separately process lightness and chromatic information. In summary, the main arguments in this paper are: 1) besides image quality and visual performance, there is a need for perceptual reproduction quality assessment; 2) entropy is the proper statistical estimator for evaluating the perceptual reproduction quality; and 3) color reproduction quality estimation requires processing lightness and chromatic attributes separately. © 2019 SMPTE</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077401027&amp;doi=10.5594%2fJMI.2019.2941361&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5cf799c9aa62e161de141fa12d37d9fa</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jensen, K.</author><author>Toft, S.</author><author>Sigsgaard, L.</author><author>Sørensen, J.G.</author><author>Holmstrup, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prey-specific impact of cold pre-exposure on kill rate and reproduction</title><secondary-title>Journal of Animal Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Animal Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>258-268</pages><volume>88</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1365-2656.12916</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Temperature influences biological processes of ectotherms including ecological interactions, but interaction strengths may depend on species-specific traits. Furthermore, ectotherms acclimate to prevailing thermal conditions by adjusting physiological parameters, which often implies costs to other fitness-related parameters. Both predators and prey may therefore pay thermal acclimation costs following exposure to suboptimal temperatures. However, these costs may be asymmetrical between predator and prey, and between the predator and different species of concurrent prey. We investigated whether thermal pre-exposure affected subsequent kill rate and predator fitness when foraging on prey that differ in ease of capture, and whether changes were primarily caused by predator or by prey pre-exposure effects. Specifically, we were interested in whether there were interactions between predator pre-exposed temperature and specific prey. Using the mesostigmatid mite Gaeolaelaps aculeifer as a generalist predator and the collembolans Folsomia candida and Protaphorura fimata as prey, we measured the impact of present temperature, predator pre-exposure temperature, prey pre-exposure temperature (all 10 or 20°C), prey species, and all interactions on prey numbers killed, predator eggs produced, and exploitation of killed prey in a full factorial design. Mites killed P. fimata in equal numbers independent of the presence of F. candida, but killed F. candida when P. fimata was absent. Mite kill rate and reproduction were significantly affected by mite pre-exposure temperature and test temperature, but not by prey pre-exposure temperature. Significantly more of the slower prey was killed than of the quicker prey. Importantly, we found significant synergistic negative interaction effects between predator cold pre-exposure and hunting prey of higher agility on predator kill rate and reproduction. Our findings show that the negative effects of cold and cold pre-exposure on kill rate and reproduction may be more severe when predators forage on quick prey. The study implies that predator cold exposure has consequences for specific prey survival following cold due to altered predation pressures, which in nature should influence the specific prey population dynamics and apparent competition outcomes. The findings exemplify how not only current but also preceding conditions affect ecological interactions, and that effect strength depends on the species involved. © 2018 The Authors.

Genetic factors are proposed contributors to age-related increases in blood pressure, but few genetic loci have been identified. We examined the role of mitochondrial genomic variation in blood pressure by sequencing the mitochondrial genome. Methods and Results-—Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data from 1755 participants from the LIFE (Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders) studies and 788 participants from the Health ABC (Health, Aging, and Body Composition) study were evaluated using replication analysis followed by meta-analysis. Participants were aged ≥69 years, of diverse racial backgrounds, and assessed for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure. After meta-analysis across the LIFE and Health ABC studies, statistically significant associations of mtDNA variants with higher SBP (m.3197T&gt;C, 16S rRNA; P=0.0005) and mean arterial pressure (m.15924A&gt;G, t-RNA-thr; P=0.004) were identified in white participants. Among black participants, statistically significant associations with higher SBP (m.93A&gt;G, HVII; m.16183A&gt;C, HVI; both P=0.0001) and mean arterial pressure (m.16172T&gt;C, HVI; m.16183A&gt;C, HVI; m.16189T&gt;C, HVI; m.12705C&gt;T; all P’s&lt;0.0004) were observed. Significant pooled effects on SBP were observed across all transfer RNA regions (P=0.0056) in white participants. The individual and aggregate variant results are statistically significant after multiple comparisons adjustment for the number of mtDNA variants and mitochondrial regions examined. Conclusions-—These results suggest that mtDNA-encoded variants are associated with variation in SBP and mean arterial pressure among older adults. These results may help identify mitochondrial activities to explain differences in blood pressure in older adults and generate new hypotheses surrounding mtDNA variation and the regulation of blood pressure. © 2018 The Authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055614549&amp;doi=10.1161%2fJAHA.118.010009&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6362fb6db22026b1c64cadb0d49d55f8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoeppner, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A note on replication analysis</title><secondary-title>International Review of Law and Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Review of Law and Economics</full-title></periodical><pages>98-102</pages><volume>59</volume><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.irle.2019.05.004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This short note surveys the cornerstones of the current literature on replication analysis.

With data from four large-scale replication projects in experimental psychology and economics, and techniques from machine learning, we train predictive models and study which variables drive predictable replication. The models predicts binary replication with a cross-validated accuracy rate of 70% (AUC of 0.77) and estimates of relative effect sizes with a Spearman ρ of 0.38. The accuracy level is similar to market-aggregated beliefs of peer scientists [1, 2]. The predictive power is validated in a pre-registered out of sample test of the outcome of [3], where 71% (AUC of 0.73) of replications are predicted correctly and effect size correlations amount to ρ = 0.25. Basic features such as the sample and effect sizes in original papers, and whether reported effects are single-variable main effects or two-variable interactions, are predictive of successful replication. The models presented in this paper are simple tools to produce cheap, prognostic replicability metrics. These models could be useful in institutionalizing the process of evaluation of new findings and guiding resources to those direct replications that are likely to be most informative. © 2019 Altmejd et al.

Broken bone is a bone condition that endured a breakdown of bone trustworthiness. The Fracture can't recognize effortlessly by the bare eye, so it is found in the x-beam images. The motivation behind this task is to find the precise territory where the bone fracture happens utilizing X-Ray Bone Fracture Detection by Canny Edge Detection Method. Shrewd Edge Detection technique is an ideal edge identification calculation on deciding the finish of a line with alterable limit and less error rate. The reproduction results have indicated how canny edge detection can help decide area of breaks in x-beam images.

Methods: The effects of miR-520a on the proliferation, mitotic index and apoptosis of the HBVreplicating human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2.2.15 were measured using standard laboratory methods including flow cytometry. The effects of miR-520a on HBV transcription and replication were assessed using methods including immunoassays and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to AKT on the levels of AKT mRNA and protein were also evaluated. Results: In HepG2.2.15 cells, miRNA-520a reduced HBV transcription and replication by reducing AKT levels. MiRNA-520a decreased cell proliferation and mitosis entry of cells and increased apoptosis in HepG2.2.15 cells. AKT levels were reduced significantly by its siRNA, which resulted in suppression of HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. Conclusions: MiRNA-520a inhibited AKT gene expression and suppressed HBV transcription and replication. These findings suggest that miRNA-520a may be a novel target for the treatment of HBV infection because miRNA-520a reduced HepG2.2.15 cell survival and inhibited HBV replication associated with the AKT signalling pathway. © The Author(s) 2018.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056261624&amp;doi=10.1177%2f0300060518792780&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5ba610561e748e323e8b62c399fb5981</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kanagawa, Y.</author><author>Kaneko, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rogue-Gym: A new challenge for generalization in reinforcement learning</title><secondary-title>IEEE Conference on Computatonal Intelligence and Games, CIG</secondary-title></titles><volume>2019-August</volume><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/CIG.2019.8848075</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper, we propose Rogue-Gym, a simple and classic style roguelike game built for evaluating generalization in reinforcement learning (RL). Combined with the recent progress of deep neural networks, RL has successfully trained humanlevel agents without human knowledge in many games such as those for Atari 2600. However, it has been pointed out that agents trained with RL methods often overfit the training environment, and they work poorly in slightly different environments. To investigate this problem, some research environments with procedural content generation have been proposed. Following these studies, we propose the use of roguelikes as a benchmark for evaluating the generalization ability of RL agents. In our Rogue-Gym, agents need to explore dungeons that are structured differently each time they start a new game. Thanks to the very diverse structures of the dungeons, we believe that the generalization benchmark of Rogue-Gym is sufficiently fair. In our experiments, we evaluate a standard reinforcement learning method, PPO, with and without enhancements for generalization. The results show that some enhancements believed to be effective fail to mitigate the overfitting in Rogue-Gym, although others slightly improve the generalization ability. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073108508&amp;doi=10.1109%2fCIG.2019.8848075&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8182e67bf2c31eb6badbbbbfc2a8cb52</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Q.</author><author>Welsh, K.J.</author><author>Bruns, D.E.</author><author>Sacks, D.B.</author><author>Zhao, Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inadequate reporting of analytical characteristics of biomarkers used in clinical research: A threat to interpretation and replication of study findings</title><secondary-title>Clinical Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>1554-1562</pages><volume>65</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1373/clinchem.2019.309575</electronic-resource-num><abstract>BACKGROUND: Analytical characteristics of methods to measure biomarkers determine how well the methods measure what they claim to measure. Transparent reporting of analytical characteristics allows readers to assess the validity and generalizability of clinical studies in which biomarkers are used. Our aims were to assess the reporting of analytical characteristics of biomarkers used in clinical research and to evaluate the extent of reported characterization procedures for assay precision. METHODS: We searched 5 medical journals (Annals of Internal Medicine, JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine, and PLOS Medicine) over a 10-year period for the term “biomarker” in the full-text field. We included studies in which biomarkers were used for inclusion/exclusion of study participants, for patient classification, or as a study outcome. We tabulated the frequencies of reporting of 11 key analytical characteristics (such as analytical accuracy of test results) in the included studies. RESULTS: A total of 544 studies and 1299 biomarker uses met the inclusion criteria. No information on analytical characteristics was reported for 67% of the biomarkers. For 65 biomarkers (3%), ≥4 characteristics were reported (range, 4 – 8). The manufacturer of the measurement procedure could not be determined for 688 (53%) of the 1299 biomarkers. The extent of assessments of assay imprecision, when reported, did not meet expectations for clinical use of biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of the analytical performance of biomarker measurements is variable and often absent from published clinical studies. We suggest that readers need fuller reporting of analytical characteristics to interpret study results, assess generalizability of conclusions, and compare results among clinical studies. ©2019 American Association for Clinical Chemistry</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075814982&amp;doi=10.1373%2fclinchem.2019.309575&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=811d78ab982ca284812d0a4f50efa9f7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Correia-Zanini, M.R.G.</author><author>Marturano, E.M.</author><author>Fontaine, A.M.G.V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of early childhood education attendance on achievement, social skills, behaviour, and stress</title><secondary-title>Estudos de Psicologia (Campinas)</secondary-title><short-title>Efeitos da permanência na Educação Infantil sobre indicadores de desempenho, habilidades sociais, comportamento e estresse</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Estudos de Psicologia (Campinas)</full-title></periodical><pages>287-297</pages><volume>35</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/1982-02752018000300007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There is evidence that Early Childhood Education positively contributes to optimal performance in Elementary School, but there are few studies about its infl uence on socio-behavioral variables. This study aimed to explore the association between duration of Early Childhood Education attendance (one or two years) and developmental outcomes in the 3rd grade. A total of 151 students from public schools participated in the study and their academic performance, social skills, externalizing behavior and stress symptoms were assessed. Data analysis comprised group comparison and regression with control of socioeconomic background. The results showed that children who had attended Early Childhood Education for one more year showed better achievement and less stress symptoms. Duration of Early Childhood Education attendance was a significant positive predictor for achievement and a negative one for stress in the 3rd grade.

Contextual fear generalization is modeled in a laboratory paradigm in which one context (CTX+) is paired with an aversive unconditional stimulus (US), while the other context (CTX-) is not. The current study sought to validate a novel paradigm assessing contextual fear generalization, and to determine the extent to which stress and anxiety symptoms enhanced contextual fear generalization. Methods: Fifty-nine participants were randomized to a stress induction or control arithmetic test, followed by a differential context fear conditioning paradigm. One to three days later, participants completed a generalization gradient test with CTX+, CTX, and four generalization contexts. Results: We found successful contextual fear conditioning on measures of US expectancy, self-report fear and valence, and startle reflex, and linear generalization across the contextual gradient on expectancies and self-report measures. Acute stress induction impaired learning of the US-CTX + association during context fear acquisition. Anxiety significantly predicted greater contextual fear generalization as measured by US expectancy. Limitations: Our study provides pilot data introducing a novel fear conditioning paradigm to assess contextual generalization of fear. There is a need for further replication to validate its utility. Conclusions: Findings suggest that individuals high in anxiety show greater contextual fear generalization as measured by US expectancy. Results are discussed in terms of potential mechanisms that contribute to pervasive anxiety. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052740471&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jbtep.2018.08.009&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=108e8424092101557a179b85d819677f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forsell, E.</author><author>Viganola, D.</author><author>Pfeiffer, T.</author><author>Almenberg, J.</author><author>Wilson, B.</author><author>Chen, Y.</author><author>Nosek, B.A.</author><author>Johannesson, M.</author><author>Dreber, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting replication outcomes in the Many Labs 2 study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Economic Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Economic Psychology</full-title></periodical><volume>75</volume><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.joep.2018.10.009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Understanding and improving reproducibility is crucial for scientific progress. Prediction markets and related methods of eliciting peer beliefs are promising tools to predict replication outcomes. We invited researchers in the field of psychology to judge the replicability of 24 studies replicated in the large scale Many Labs 2 project. We elicited peer beliefs in prediction markets and surveys about two replication success metrics: the probability that the replication yields a statistically significant effect in the original direction (p &lt; 0.001), and the relative effect size of the replication. The prediction markets correctly predicted 75% of the replication outcomes, and were highly correlated with the replication outcomes. Survey beliefs were also significantly correlated with replication outcomes, but had larger prediction errors. The prediction markets for relative effect sizes attracted little trading and thus did not work well. The survey beliefs about relative effect sizes performed better and were significantly correlated with observed relative effect sizes. The results suggest that replication outcomes can be predicted and that the elicitation of peer beliefs can increase our knowledge about scientific reproducibility and the dynamics of hypothesis testing. © 2018 The Authors</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056991878&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.joep.2018.10.009&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dd6a243d29134674adbcf4c4598b30a5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Steiner, P.M.</author><author>Wong, V.C.</author><author>Anglin, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Causal Replication Framework for Designing and Assessing Replication Efforts</title><secondary-title>Zeitschrift fur Psychologie / Journal of Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zeitschrift fur Psychologie / Journal of Psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>280-292</pages><volume>227</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1027/2151-2604/a000385</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replication has long been a cornerstone for establishing trustworthy scientific results, but there remains considerable disagreement about what constitutes a replication, how results from these studies should be interpreted, and whether direct replication of results is even possible. This article addresses these concerns by presenting the methodological foundations for a replication science. It provides an introduction to the causal replication framework, which defines "replication" as a research design that tests whether two (or more) studies produce the same causal effect within the limits of sampling error. The framework formalizes the conditions under which replication success can be expected, and allows for the causal interpretation of replication failures. Through two applied examples, the article demonstrates how the causal replication framework may be utilized to plan prospective replication designs, as well as to interpret results from existing replication efforts. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076986688&amp;doi=10.1027%2f2151-2604%2fa000385&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a3a969808ca1dc41fbeb94171844c206</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hao, Q.</author><author>Smith, D.H.</author><author>Iriumi, N.</author><author>Tsikerdekis, M.</author><author>Ko, A.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A systematic investigation of replications in computing education research</title><secondary-title>ACM Transactions on Computing Education</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACM Transactions on Computing Education</full-title></periodical><volume>19</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/3345328</electronic-resource-num><abstract>As the societal demands for application and knowledge in computer science (CS) increase, CS student enrollment keeps growing rapidly around the world. By continuously improving the efficacy of computing education and providing guidelines for learning and teaching practice, computing education research plays a vital role in addressing both educational and societal challenges that emerge from the growth of CS students. Given the significant role of computing education research, it is important to ensure the reliability of studies in this field. The extent to which studies can be replicated in a field is one of the most important standards for reliability. Different fields have paid increasing attention to the replication rates of their studies, but the replication rate of computing education was never systematically studied. To fill this gap, this study investigated the replication rate of computing education between 2009 and 2018. We examined 2,269 published studies from three major conferences and two major journals in computing education, and found that the overall replication rate of computing education was 2.38%. This study demonstrated the need for more replication studies in computing education and discussed how to encourage replication studies through research initiatives and policy making. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074441050&amp;doi=10.1145%2f3345328&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=93c421935e63d1ba6247a1cdbe4d58b9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fraser, H.</author><author>Parker, T.</author><author>Nakagawa, S.</author><author>Barnett, A.</author><author>Fidler, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Questionable research practices in ecology and evolution</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0200303</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We surveyed 807 researchers (494 ecologists and 313 evolutionary biologists) about their use of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs), including cherry picking statistically significant results, p hacking, and hypothesising after the results are known (HARKing). We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution. © 2018 Fraser et al.

The reasons for these differences are unclear since both lesions similarly alter the Watson-Crick binding face of T. To rationalize these replication outcomes at a molecular level, this work uses density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to probe the lesion base-pairing properties as well as lesion accommodation by human polymerase δ• (pol δ•) and post-extension DNA duplexes. O4-Me-T forms two strong hydrogen bonds with an opposing G in the active site of pol δ•, which rationalizes the observed lesion mutagenicity. Nevertheless, dATP insertion opposite O4-Me-T can proceed through water-mediated hydrogen bonding, which is similar to the pathway previously proposed for pol δ• bypass of abasic sites and other T alkylation lesions. In contrast, the position of O2-Me-T in the pol δ• active site is dynamic due to the presence of the aberrant methyl group on the minor groove side of DNA. In fact, the experimental replication outcomes can only be rationalized when the syn glycosidic orientation of O2-Me-T is considered, which stabilizes the pre-insertion complex by placing the damage in the polymerase open pocket on the major groove side of DNA. Although dATP insertion can occur opposite syn-O2-Me-T through a water-mediated pathway similar to O4-Me-T replication, rotation about the glycosidic bond precludes a stable pol δ• ternary complex corresponding to dGTP insertion, which correlates with the reported nonmutagenic bypass of O2-Me-T. In addition to providing structural insights into the differential mutagenicity of methylated T adducts, our data highlight an emerging theme in the literature for the replication of pyrimidine alkylation products in noncanonical glycosidic orientations and sets the stage for future work on the replication of other alkylated lesions by TLS polymerases. © 2019 American Chemical Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072641420&amp;doi=10.1021%2facs.chemrestox.9b00291&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ac1b420860c195225d5f79e1f633d0d2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hedges, L.V.</author><author>Schauer, J.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Statistical Analyses for Studying Replication: Meta-Analytic Perspectives</title><secondary-title>Psychological Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychological Methods</full-title></periodical><pages>557-570</pages><volume>24</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1037/met0000189</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Formal empirical assessments of replication have recently become more prominent in several areas of science, including psychology. These assessments have used different statistical approaches to determine if a finding has been replicated. The purpose of this article is to provide several alternative conceptual frameworks that lead to different statistical analyses to test hypotheses about replication. All of these analyses are based on statistical methods used in meta-analysis. The differences among the methods described involve whether the burden of proof is placed on replication or nonreplication, whether replication is exact or allows for a small amount of “negligible heterogeneity,” and whether the studies observed are assumed to be fixed (constituting the entire body of relevant evidence) or are a sample from a universe of possibly relevant studies. The statistical power of each of these tests is computed and shown to be low in many cases, raising issues of the interpretability of tests for replication. © 2018 American Psychological Association</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051218506&amp;doi=10.1037%2fmet0000189&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=43e2a57eaf73735b8cd4859166c4e306</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cintas, J.D.</author><author>Szarkowska, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Introduction: Experimental research in audiovisual translation – Cognition, reception, production</title><secondary-title>Journal of Specialised Translation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Specialised Translation</full-title></periodical><pages>3-16</pages><number>33</number><issue>33</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>In recent years, an unprecedented boom in experimental research conducted in the field of audiovisual translation (AVT) has taken place, marking a shift from individual, descriptive case studies towards an attempt at establishing some evidence-based truths. Using a combination of new methods and technologies, AVT researchers have embarked on the examination of various cognitive aspects governing not only the reception of translated audiovisual programmes but also the actual translation process behind practices like subtitling, captioning, dubbing, voice-over and audio description. This special issue aims to reflect this new trend, by capturing both research strands: reception and production. The paper starts with a discussion of the experimental and cognitive research shift in AVT studies, stressing the special, multimodal nature of audiovisual communication. A higher rate of replication and reproducibility of AVT research is also postulated, with suggestions of how to promote this. Finally, a summary of the contents of this special issue is presented, structured in three main parts: (1) conducting experimental research with the help of biosensor devices, (2) researching the behaviour of AVT professionals and (3) carrying out survey-based reception studies. © 2020 University of Roehampton.

Using the Comparative Crime Data File (CCDF), we replicated the original study with data from the two World Wars, as well as 12 smaller wars occurring prior to 1980. Our replication results generally confirmed the hypothesis that wars increase postwar homicide rates, although there were differences in results based on the method of analysis. We then examined the validity of this theory using data on four wars occurring after 1990, but found no support for the legitimation of violence argument. We argue that the null findings encourage theoretical expansion, which is an underappreciated aspect of replication that is just as valuable as empirical validation. © The Author(s) 2018.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046678145&amp;doi=10.1177%2f1043986218769989&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=10960556c9ec55d50bf34b7d19af0f06</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moore, J.E.</author><author>Liu, B.</author><author>Khan, S.</author><author>Harris, C.</author><author>Ewusie, J.E.</author><author>Hamid, J.S.</author><author>Straus, S.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can the effects of the mobilization of vulnerable elders in Ontario (MOVE ON) implementation be replicated in new settings: an interrupted time series design</title><secondary-title>BMC Geriatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Geriatrics</full-title></periodical><volume>19</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12877-019-1124-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Bed rest for older hospitalized patients places them at risk for hospital-acquired morbidity. We previously evaluated an early mobilization intervention and found it to be effective at improving mobilization rates and decreasing length of stay on internal medicine units. The aim of this study was to conduct a replication study evaluating the impact of the evidence-informed mobilization intervention on surgery, psychiatry, medicine, and cardiology inpatient units. Methods: A multi-component early mobilization intervention was tailored to the local context at seven hospitals in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcome was patient mobilization measured by conducting visual audits twice a week, three times a day. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and discharge destination, which were obtained from hospital decision support data. The study population was patients aged 65 years and older who were admitted to surgery, psychiatry, medicine, and cardiology inpatient units between March and August 2014. Using an interrupted time series design, the intervention was evaluated over three time periods-pre-intervention, during, and post-intervention. Results: A total of 3098 patients [mean age 78.46 years (SD 8.38)] were included in the overall analysis. There was a significant increase in mobility immediately after the intervention period compared to pre-intervention with a slope change of 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-3.08, P-value = 0.0014). A decreasing trend in median length of stay was observed in the majority of the participating sites. Overall, a median length of stay of 26.24 days (95% CI 23.67-28.80) was observed pre-intervention compared to 23.81 days (95% CI 20.13-27.49) during the intervention and 24.69 days (95% CI 22.43-26.95) post-intervention. The overall decrease in median length of stay was associated with the increase in mobility across the sites. Conclusions: MOVE increased mobilization and these results were replicated across surgery, psychiatry, medicine, and cardiology inpatient units. © 2019 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063898057&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12877-019-1124-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8a3f2b5ebe45a9c885cf472971226fca</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thailambal, G.</author><author>Shanmugalakshmi, P.</author><author>Durga, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel method of rainfall prediction using MLP-FFN and hybrid neural network algorithm</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>2858-2862</pages><volume>8</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.35940/ijitee.J9607.0881019</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The present work proposes a cross breed neural system and multilayer perceptron_ feed forward system based model for precipitation forecast.

With more and more embedding models being proposed, it has been widely used in many tasks such as semantic search, knowledge graph completion and intelligent question and answer. Most knowledge graph embedding models focus on how to get information about different entities and relations. However, the generalization of knowledge graph embedding or the link prediction ability is not well-studied empirically and theoretically. The study of generalization ability is conducive to further improving the performance of the model. In this paper, we propose two measures to quantify the generalization ability of knowledge graph embedding and use them to analyze the performance of translation-based models. Extensive experimental results show that our measures can well evaluate the generalization ability of a knowledge graph embedding model. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080883126&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-41407-8_11&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f46123ddbcb161c78d2478d2de8dcc20</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Camerer, C.F.</author><author>Dreber, A.</author><author>Holzmeister, F.</author><author>Ho, T.-H.</author><author>Huber, J.</author><author>Johannesson, M.</author><author>Kirchler, M.</author><author>Nave, G.</author><author>Nosek, B.A.</author><author>Pfeiffer, T.</author><author>Altmejd, A.</author><author>Buttrick, N.</author><author>Chan, T.</author><author>Chen, Y.</author><author>Forsell, E.</author><author>Gampa, A.</author><author>Heikensten, E.</author><author>Hummer, L.</author><author>Imai, T.</author><author>Isaksson, S.</author><author>Manfredi, D.</author><author>Rose, J.</author><author>Wagenmakers, E.-J.</author><author>Wu, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the replicability of social science experiments in Nature and Science between 2010 and 2015</title><secondary-title>Nature Human Behaviour</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Human Behaviour</full-title></periodical><pages>637-644</pages><volume>2</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41562-018-0399-z</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Being able to replicate scientific findings is crucial for scientific progress1–15. We replicate 21 systematically selected experimental studies in the social sciences published in Nature and Science between 2010 and 201516–36. The replications follow analysis plans reviewed by the original authors and pre-registered prior to the replications. The replications are high powered, with sample sizes on average about five times higher than in the original studies. We find a significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 13 (62%) studies, and the effect size of the replications is on average about 50% of the original effect size. Replicability varies between 12 (57%) and 14 (67%) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated true-positive rate is 67% in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71%, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility. Furthermore, we find that peer beliefs of replicability are strongly related to replicability, suggesting that the research community could predict which results would replicate and that failures to replicate were not the result of chance alone. © 2018, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052962253&amp;doi=10.1038%2fs41562-018-0399-z&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dfd59d08a159f8079e7b002f23dffa43</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aung, N.</author><author>Vargas, J.D.</author><author>Yang, C.</author><author>Cabrera, C.P.</author><author>Warren, H.R.</author><author>Fung, K.</author><author>Tzanis, E.</author><author>Barnes, M.R.</author><author>Rotter, J.I.</author><author>Taylor, K.D.</author><author>Manichaikul, A.W.</author><author>Lima, J.A.C.</author><author>Bluemke, D.A.</author><author>Piechnik, S.K.</author><author>Neubauer, S.</author><author>Munroe, P.B.</author><author>Petersen, S.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide analysis of left ventricular image-derived phenotypes identifies fourteen loci associated with cardiac morphogenesis and heart failure development</title><secondary-title>Circulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation</full-title></periodical><pages>1318-1330</pages><volume>140</volume><number>16</number><issue>16</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041161</electronic-resource-num><abstract>BACKGROUND: The genetic basis of left ventricular (LV) image-derived phenotypes, which play a vital role in the diagnosis, management, and risk stratification of cardiovascular diseases, is unclear at present. METHODS: The LV parameters were measured from the cardiovascular magnetic resonance studies of the UK Biobank. Genotyping was done using Affymetrix arrays, augmented by imputation. We performed genome-wide association studies of 6 LV traits-LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, LV stroke volume, LV ejection fraction, LV mass, and LV mass to end-diastolic volume ratio. The replication analysis was performed in the MESA study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). We identified the candidate genes at genome-wide significant loci based on the evidence from extensive bioinformatic analyses. Polygenic risk scores were constructed from the summary statistics of LV genome-wide association studies to predict the heart failure events. RESULTS: The study comprised 16 923 European UK Biobank participants (mean age 62.5 years; 45.8% men) without prevalent myocardial infarction or heart failure. We discovered 14 genomewide significant loci (3 loci each for LV end-diastolic volume, LV endsystolic volume, and LV mass to end-diastolic volume ratio; 4 loci for LV ejection fraction, and 1 locus for LV mass) at a stringent P&lt;1×10-8. Three loci were replicated at Bonferroni significance and 7 loci at nominal significance (P&lt;0.05 with concordant direction of effect) in the MESA study (n=4383). Follow-up bioinformatic analyses identified 28 candidate genes that were enriched in the cardiac developmental pathways and regulation of the LV contractile mechanism. Eight genes (TTN, BAG3, GRK5, HSPB7, MTSS1, ALPK3, NMB, and MMP11) supported by at least 2 independent lines of in silico evidence were implicated in the cardiac morphogenesis and heart failure development. The polygenic risk scores of LV phenotypes were predictive of heart failure in a holdout UK Biobank sample of 3106 cases and 224 134 controls (odds ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.26 - 1.58, for the top quintile versus the bottom quintile of the LV end-systolic volume risk score). CONCLUSIONS: We report 14 genetic loci and indicate several candidate genes that not only enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of prognostically important LV phenotypes but also shed light on potential novel therapeutic targets for LV remodeling. © 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073184260&amp;doi=10.1161%2fCIRCULATIONAHA.119.041161&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d4371567a4a39f7c839a7deab13dc616</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ekanayake, D.B.</author><author>Ekanayake, A.J.</author><author>Hunt, J.</author><author>Miller-Hunt, C.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling reproduction of whitetail deer and its applications</title><secondary-title>Journal of Theoretical Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Theoretical Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>90-102</pages><volume>459</volume><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.09.032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many environmental factors, such as annual precipitation, temperature variations, and the embedded stochasticity of natural systems, affect resource availability from one region to the next, such that animal survival and reproduction rates differ by region. For species exhibiting phenotypic plasticity, embedding phenotypes in a model of population dynamics becomes important, as region–driven plastic responses play a significant role when estimating parameters values. In this paper, we discuss how to include observable characteristics and climate patterns in estimates of reproduction rates of whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Using many studies already available in the literature, we establish a strong correlation between reproduction rate and both body weight and USDA plant hardiness zone. We demonstrate the accuracy of the estimated whitetail deer fecundity rates for various geographical regions in North America and show that Bergmann's rule is necessary to maintain similar biological fitness between various spatial distributions of deer populations. We demonstrate that the standard deviation of the weight distribution has almost no effect on reproduction rate estimates for adult deer populations. However, statistical analysis reveals sensitivity of fawn reproduction rates to environmental stochasticity. We incorporate the reproduction function in a stage– and gender–based model and prove the existence of a stable solution. Finally, we demonstrate a possible application of the model using harvested deer weights, without collecting reproduction data directly. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054317723&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jtbi.2018.09.032&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0439cab9c9fc4e25d89c57935dc8a3ac</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kiweler, M.</author><author>Looso, M.</author><author>Graumann, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MARMoSET – Extracting Publication-ready Mass Spectrometry Metadata from RAW Files</title><secondary-title>Molecular and Cellular Proteomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular and Cellular Proteomics</full-title></periodical><pages>1700-1702</pages><volume>18</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/mcp.TIR119.001505</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In the context of publishing data sets acquired by mass spectrometry or works based on such molecular screens, metadata documenting the instrument settings are of central importance to the evaluation and reproduction of results.

Overall, understanding the factors affecting rapid disease progression in early HIV infection (EHI) can aid in treatment initiation. Recent studies show that eIF3s, classic scaffold proteins during the translation initiation process, can directly promote or inhibit the translation of mRNA, therefore participating in the regulation of cell function. However, to our knowledge, it has not been addressed whether eIF3s are involved in the diverse prognosis of HIV infection. Methods: Expression of eIF3s in primary cells from early or chronic HIV-infected patients was detected by real-time PCR. To investigate the potential mechanisms of eIF3d in the regulation of CD8+ T cell function, complete transcriptomes of eIF3d-inhibited Jurkat T cells were sequenced by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Additionally, to examine the effect of eIF3d on CD8+ T cell function, eIF3d expression was inhibited alone or in combination with SOCS-7 knockdown by siRNA in isolated CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cell proliferation, IFN-r secretion and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Moreover, the effect of eIF3d on HIV replication was evaluated in Jurkat cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CD4+ T cells with eIF3d knockdown using a pNL4-3 pseudotyped virus. Results: At approximately 100 days of infection, only eIF3d was markedly decreased in RPs compared with chronic progressors (CPs). Expression of eIF3d correlated significantly with disease progression in EHI. Based on in vitro analyses, reduced eIF3d expression led to decreased proliferation and IFN-γsecretion and increased apoptosis in CD8+ T cells. Inhibited expression of eIF3d caused enhanced expression of SOCS-7, and inhibiting SOCS-7 expression by siRNA rescued the attenuated CD8+ T cell function caused by eIF3d. Finally, when eIF3d was inhibited in Jurkat cells, PBMCs and CD4+ T cells, pNL4-3-VSV-G virus replication was enhanced. Conclusions: The current data highlight the importance of eIF3d in HIV infection by inhibiting CD8+ T cell function and promoting viral replication. Our study provides potential targets for improved immune intervention. © 2019 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066465930&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12967-019-1925-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b4bab7d10c8d1af1508a7d30edbcead9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mousavian, S.N.</author><author>Eskandari, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Allelopathic effect of two medicinal plants on seed germination, seedling growth and grain production of purslane (Portulaca oleraceae L.) weed</title><secondary-title>Acta Agriculturae Slovenica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Agriculturae Slovenica</full-title></periodical><pages>293-301</pages><volume>111</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.14720/aas.2018.111.2.05</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A laboratory factorial (2 × 5) experiment was carried out based on completely randomized block in four replications to evaluate the effect of plant species and concentration of their allelopathic extracts on seed germination and seedling growth of purslane weed (Portulaca oleraceae L.). The first factor studied was plant species (Artemisia sieberi and Salvia syriaca) and the second one the concentration percentage of plant ethanol extract (0.0, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %). The effect of Artemisia on germination reduction of purslane was stronger compared to Salvia. The results indicated that higher extract concentration led to decreased germination percentage, germination speed and seedling growth indices of purslane including leaf length, leaf number, leaf width, leaf dry mass, stem mass and stem length. The effect of Artemisia was higher than that of Salvia. In a complementary experiment, the effect plant residues of Artemisia and Salvia (0.0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 g kg-1 soil) were evaluated in a factorial experiment base on completely randomized block design with three replications. The results of field experiment showed that plant residues significantly (P = 0.01) reduced capsule number per plant, seed number per capsule, seed production and shoot dry mass, while its effect on 1000-seed mass was not substantial. The effect of plant species and the interaction of plant species and their allelopathic extracts concentration had no major impact on the above-mentioned properties. The increase in plant residues in soil, led to the reduction of growth and seed production of purslane induced by plant number per unit area and capsule per plant. Artemisia sieberi Bess. and Salvia syriaca L. residues can be successfully used for non-chemical control of purslane weed. © 2018 University of Ljubljana.

However, those techniques' components are difficult to extract and reuse outside their original tools, their evaluation results are hard to reproduce, and the tools themselves are hard to compare. This paper introduces DECREE, an infrastructure intended to guide such techniques to be reproducible, practical, reusable, and easy to adopt in practice. DECREE allows researchers and developers to easily discover existing solutions to their needs, enables unbiased and reproducible evaluation, and supports easy construction and execution of replication studies.

Aims: This systematic review evaluated peer-reviewed single-case experimental design (SCED) studies concerning evidence of generalization and maintenance effects of tablet-based interventions for individuals with ASD. Methods: To evaluate the methodological rigor of the literature in terms of generalization and maintenance effects, the authors adopted four of the basic design standards developed by What Works Clearinghouse (WWC; Kratochwill et al., 2010/2014). In addition, the authors used Tau-U effect size measure and attempted to calculate effect sizes differentiated by the type of generalization and maintenance teaching strategies. Results: A total of 21 studies assessed generalization and/or maintenance effects. In the first evaluation of evidence of generalization and maintenance effects, it was found that more than half of the studies included in this review collected interobserver agreement (IOA) on at least 20% of sessions across all generalization and maintenance conditions and met the minimum quality thresholds of IOA. Meanwhile, less than one third of the studies included more than three data points in each generalization and maintenance condition. With regard to maintenance of effects, about half of the reviewed studies did not report the latency to the maintenance measure, which may hamper the assessment of the clinical and practical significance of the effect of the tablet-based intervention. In the second evaluation, the omnibus Tau-U effect size for baseline to generalization comparisons resulted in a moderate effect. For the contrasts between intervention and generalization comparisons resulted in a small effect. The omnibus Tau-U effect size for baseline and maintenance comparisons resulted in a strong effect. For the contrasts between intervention to maintenance comparisons, the omnibus Tau-U effect size resulted in a small effect. Conclusions and implication: Findings in this review suggest that efforts should be made to establish a system for appraising generalization and maintenance procedures in SCED studies. In addition, future studies should investigate if tablet-based interventions are truly effective in creating sustainable behavioral change in individuals with ASD. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049907386&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.ridd.2018.01.014&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e8b186ace48d95f9239524d9cf4cd62b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hedges, L.V.</author><author>Schauer, J.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>More Than One Replication Study Is Needed for Unambiguous Tests of Replication</title><secondary-title>Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics</full-title></periodical><pages>543-570</pages><volume>44</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3102/1076998619852953</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The problem of assessing whether experimental results can be replicated is becoming increasingly important in many areas of science.

Thus, unless the original study and the replication study have unusually high power (e.g., power of 98%), a single replication study will not have adequate sensitivity to provide an unambiguous evaluation of replication. © 2019 AERA.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067785353&amp;doi=10.3102%2f1076998619852953&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3e89ba547c05bfb991a9e63655c7c392</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kleinberg, B.</author><author>Warmelink, L.</author><author>Arntz, A.</author><author>Verschuere, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The first direct replication on using verbal credibility assessment for the detection of deceptive intentions</title><secondary-title>Applied Cognitive Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Cognitive Psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>592-599</pages><volume>32</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/acp.3439</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Verbal deception detection has gained momentum as a technique to tell truth-tellers from liars. At the same time, researchers' degrees of freedom make it hard to assess the robustness of effects. Replication research can help evaluate how reproducible an effect is. We present the first replication in verbal deception research whereby ferry passengers were instructed to tell the truth or lie about their travel plans. The original study found truth-tellers to include more specific time references in their answers. The replication study that closely mimicked the setting, procedure, materials, coding, and analyses found no lie–truth difference for specific time references. Although the power of our replication study was suboptimal (0.77), Bayesian statistics showed evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. Given the great applied consequences of verbal credibility tests, we hope this first replication attempt ignites much needed preregistered, high-powered, multilab replication efforts. © 2018 The Authors Applied Cognitive Psychology Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050452728&amp;doi=10.1002%2facp.3439&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c5e193a9306eaa11cb787c4183cb9fbc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biabani, A.</author><author>Carpenter-Boggs, L.</author><author>Gholizadeh, A.</author><author>Vafaie-Tabar, M.</author><author>Omara, M.O.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproduction Efficiency of Eisenia foetida and Substrate Changes During Vermicomposting of Organic Materials</title><secondary-title>Compost Science and Utilization</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Compost Science and Utilization</full-title></periodical><pages>209-215</pages><volume>26</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/1065657X.2018.1463877</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Vermicomposting is the processing of organic substrates through digestion by worms, usually Eisenia foetida. The physico-chemical characteristics of the substrates and health of the worms are important parameter for effective vermicomposting. This study assessed reproduction efficiency and reproductive rate of E. foetida and changes in EC, pH, organic C, total Nitrogen and C:N ratio by vermicomposting different substrate mixtures. The study was performed as a completely randomized design with 10 treatments and 4 replicates. Manures from sheep and horse were tested alone and mixed at 50 and 75% with residues of alfalfa and wheat straw. Wheat straw was also tested alone and mixed at 75% with 25% chicken manure. E. foetida were added to the mixtures and allowed to process the substrate mixtures for three months. Final EC, pH, organic C and N levels of vermicompost were measured, as well as the reproductive efficiency and reproductive rate of the E. foetida. All measured characteristics of the finished vermicompost were significantly different depending on substrate. Substrates also changed to differing degrees during vermicomposting. Total C and EC increased in all substrates; and pH, total N, and C:N decreased in all substrates during vermicomposting The greatest change of EC was in the 25% alfalfa + 75% sheep manure mixture, which was 12.8 dS.m-1 initially and 18.6 dS.m-1 in finished vermicompost. Overall, pH declined and EC increased during the preparing of vermicompost. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049225018&amp;doi=10.1080%2f1065657X.2018.1463877&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=80b96f6a2b1b19606828ec1f0469b405</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McManus, E.</author><author>Turner, D.</author><author>Gray, E.</author><author>Khawar, H.</author><author>Okoli, T.</author><author>Sach, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Barriers and Facilitators to Model Replication Within Health Economics</title><secondary-title>Value in Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Value in Health</full-title></periodical><pages>1018-1025</pages><volume>22</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jval.2019.04.1928</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Model replication is important because it enables researchers to check research integrity and transparency and, potentially, to inform the model conceptualization process when developing a new or updated model. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the replicability of published decision analytic models and to identify the barriers and facilitators to replication. Methods: Replication attempts of 5 published economic modeling studies were made. The replications were conducted using only publicly available information within the manuscripts and supplementary materials. The replicator attempted to reproduce the key results detailed in the paper, for example, the total cost, total outcomes, and if applicable, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio reported. Although a replication attempt was not explicitly defined as a success or failure, the replicated results were compared for percentage difference to the original results. Results: In conducting the replication attempts, common barriers and facilitators emerged. For most case studies, the replicator needed to make additional assumptions when recreating the model. This was often exacerbated by conflicting information being presented in the text and the tables. Across the case studies, the variation between original and replicated results ranged from −4.54% to 108.00% for costs and −3.81% to 0.40% for outcomes. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that although models may appear to be comprehensively reported, it is often not enough to facilitate a precise replication. Further work is needed to understand how to improve model transparency and in turn increase the chances of replication, thus ensuring future usability. © 2019 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068818425&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jval.2019.04.1928&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8c379689096a4157cdda7a534d43b99a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borovykh, A.</author><author>Oosterlee, C.W.</author><author>Bohté, S.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization in fully-connected neural networks for time series forecasting</title><secondary-title>Journal of Computational Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Computational Science</full-title></periodical><volume>36</volume><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jocs.2019.07.007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper we study the generalization capabilities of fully-connected neural networks trained in the context of time series forecasting. Time series do not satisfy the typical assumption in statistical learning theory of the data being i.i.d. samples from some data-generating distribution. We use the input and weight Hessians, that is the smoothness of the learned function with respect to the input and the width of the minimum in weight space, to quantify a network's ability to generalize to unseen data. While such generalization metrics have been studied extensively in the i.i.d. setting of for example image recognition, here we empirically validate their use in the task of time series forecasting. Furthermore we discuss how one can control the generalization capability of the network by means of the training process using the learning rate, batch size and the number of training iterations as controls. Using these hyperparameters one can efficiently control the complexity of the output function without imposing explicit constraints. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070825023&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jocs.2019.07.007&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dbcc69a2d618fda3b7fae155411af433</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parker, K.D.</author><author>Albeke, S.E.</author><author>Gigley, J.P.</author><author>Goldstein, A.M.</author><author>Ward, N.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microbiome composition in both wild-type and disease model mice is heavily influenced by mouse facility</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>JUL</number><issue>JUL</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fmicb.2018.01598</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Murine models have become essential tools for understanding the complex interactions between gut microbes, their hosts, and disease. While many intra-facility factors are known to influence the structure of mouse microbiomes, the contribution of inter-facility variation to mouse microbiome composition, especially in the context of disease, remains under-investigated. We replicated microbiome experiments using identical mouse lines housed in two separate animal facilities and report drastic differences in composition of microbiomes based upon animal facility of origin. We observed facility-specific microbiome signatures in the context of a disease model [the Ednrb (endothelin receptor type B) Hirschsprung disease mouse] and in normal C57BL/6J mice. Importantly, these facility differences were independent of cage, sex, or sequencing-related influence. In addition, we investigated the reproducibility of microbiome dysbiosis previously associated with Ednrb-/- (knock-out; KO) mice. While we observed genotype-based differences in composition between wild-type (WT) and KO mice, these differences were inconsistent with the previously reported conclusions. Furthermore, the genotype-based differences were not identical across animal facilities. Despite this, through differential abundance testing, we identified several conserved candidate taxa and candidate operational taxonomic units that may play a role in disease promotion or protection. Overall, our findings raise the possibility that previously reported microbiome-disease associations from murine studies conducted in a single facility may be heavily influenced by facility-specific effects. More generally, these results provide a strong rationale for replication of mouse microbiome studies at multiple facilities, and for the meticulous collection of metadata that will allow the confounding effects of facility to be more specifically identified. © 2018 Parker, Albeke, Gigley, Goldstein and Ward.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050313223&amp;doi=10.3389%2ffmicb.2018.01598&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6250a7026a8863e01c54082d84e02cb7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boddez, Y.</author><author>Descheemaeker, M.</author><author>Mertens, G.</author><author>Truyts, A.</author><author>Van de Cruys, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Like what you see: Generalization of social learning determines art appreciation</title><secondary-title>Acta Psychologica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Psychologica</full-title></periodical><pages>18-25</pages><volume>196</volume><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.actpsy.2019.04.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We examine whether a stimulus generalization framework can provide insight in how experience shapes evaluative responses to artworks.

In this manuscript, we present the results of a badger field trial conducted in Ireland and discuss how the novel trial design and analytical methods allowed the effects of vaccination on protection against infection and, more importantly, on transmission to be estimated. The trial area was divided into three zones North to South (A, B and C) where vaccination coverages of 0, 50 and 100%, respectively, were applied. Badgers were trapped over a 4 year period. Badgers were assigned to either placebo or vaccine treatment, with treatment allocation occurring randomly in zone B. Blood samples were collected at each capture, and serology was performed in these samples using a chemiluminescent multiplex ELISA system (Enfer test). The analysis aimed to compare new infections occurring in non-infected non-vaccinated badgers to those in non-infected vaccinated ones, while accounting for the zone in which the badger was trapped and the infection pressure to which this individual badger was exposed. In total, 440 records on subsequent trappings of individual non-infected badgers were available for analysis. Over the study period, 55 new infections occurred in non-vaccinated (out of 239 = 23.0%) and 40 in vaccinated (out of 201 = 19.9%) badgers. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a cloglog link function was used for analysis. Statistical analysis showed that susceptibility to natural exposure with M. bovis was reduced in vaccinated compared to placebo treated badgers: vaccine efficacy for susceptibility, VES, was 59% (95% CI = 6.5%–82%). However, a complete lack of effect from BCG vaccination on the infectivity of vaccinated badgers was observed, i.e. vaccine efficacy for infectiousness (VEI) was 0%. Further, the basic reproduction ratio as a function of vaccination coverage (p) (i.e. R(p)) was estimated. Given that the prevalence of M. bovis infection in badgers in endemic areas in Ireland is approximately 18%, we estimated the reproduction ratio in the unvaccinated population as R(0) = 1.22. Because VES was now known, the reproduction ratio for a fully vaccinated population was estimated as R(1) = 0.50. These results imply that with vaccination coverage in badgers exceeding 30%, eradication of M. bovis in badgers in Ireland is feasible, provided that the current control measures also remain in place. © 2017 The Authors</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033400313&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.prevetmed.2017.10.010&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7637829e5d9d04c1d3bd323f08dcda79</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Herben, T.</author><author>Suda, J.</author><author>Klimešová, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polyploid species rely on vegetative reproduction more than diploids: A re-examination of the old hypothesis</title><secondary-title>Annals of Botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Botany</full-title></periodical><pages>341-349</pages><volume>120</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/aob/mcx009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background and Aims Polyploidy is arguably the single most important genetic mechanism in plant speciation and diversification. It has been repeatedly suggested that polyploids show higher vegetative reproduction than diploids (to by-pass low fertility after the polyploidization), but there are no rigorous tests of it. Methods Data were analysed by phylogenetic regressions of clonal growth parameters, and vegetative reproduction in culture on the ploidy status of a large set of species (approx. 900) from the Central European Angiosperm flora. Further, correlated evolution of ploidy and clonal traits was examined to determine whether or not polyploidy precedes vegetative reproduction. Key Results The analyses showed that polyploidy is strongly associated with vegetative reproduction, whereas diploids rely more on seed reproduction. The rate of polyploid speciation is strongly enhanced by the existence of vegetative reproduction (namely extensive lateral spread), whereas the converse is not true. Conclusions These findings confirm the old hypothesis that polyploids can rely on vegetative reproduction which thus may save many incipient polyploids from extinction. A closer analysis also shows that the sequence of events begins with development of vegetative reproduction, which is then followed by polyploidy. Vegetative reproduction is thus likely to play an important role in polyploid speciation. © The Author 2017.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026447917&amp;doi=10.1093%2faob%2fmcx009&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8c24ddcabfd4fa9dfed5296012b697f9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thomas, J.A.</author><author>Collins, C.R.</author><author>Das, S.</author><author>Hackett, F.</author><author>Graindorge, A.</author><author>Bell, D.</author><author>Deu, E.</author><author>Blackman, M.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development and application of a simple plaque assay for the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0157873</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Malaria is caused by an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that replicates within and destroys erythrocytes. Asexual blood stages of the causative agent of the most virulent form of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, can be cultivated indefinitely in vitro in human erythrocytes, facilitating experimental analysis of parasite cell biology, biochemistry and genetics. However, efforts to improve understanding of the basic biology of this important pathogen and to develop urgently required new antimalarial drugs and vaccines, suffer from a paucity of basic research tools. This includes a simple means of quantifying the effects of drugs, antibodies and gene modifications on parasite fitness and replication rates. Here we describe the development and validation of an extremely simple, robust plaque assay that can be used to visualise parasite replication and resulting host erythrocyte destruction at the level of clonal parasite populations. We demonstrate applications of the plaque assay by using it for the phenotypic characterisation of two P. falciparum conditional mutants displaying reduced fitness in vitro. © 2016 Thomas et al.

Users face sort of dissatisfaction when the results fetched by search engines are not related to the query they have asked for. This irrelevance result is retrieved huge based on the enormous variety of consumers’ perspective and backgrounds, as well as the ambiguity of the contents. However, evidences show that the user’s private information which they search has become public due to the proliferation of Personalized Web Search. The proposed framework RPS implement re-ranking technique, which adaptively make simpler user profiles by queries while respecting the consumer particular constraints of privacy. The great challenge in personalized web search is Privacy protection. To increase the efficiency and accuracy of web search privacy we use Greedy IL algorithm, i.e. GreedyDP and GreedyIL, for runtime generalization. Experiment assessment results show that the privacy-preserving personalized framework and re-ranking approach is highly effective and accurate enough for user profiling privacy personalization on the web search. © Springer India 2016.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958949816&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-81-322-2752-6_7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8e6c08f066f41503af5b1311ce1487df</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jacobs, E.S.</author><author>Keating, S.M.</author><author>Abdel-Mohsen, M.</author><author>Gibb, S.L.</author><author>Heitman, J.W.</author><author>Inglis, H.C.</author><author>Martin, J.N.</author><author>Zhang, J.</author><author>Kaidarova, Z.</author><author>Deng, X.</author><author>Wu, S.</author><author>Anastos, K.</author><author>Crystal, H.</author><author>Villacres, M.C.</author><author>Young, M.</author><author>Greenblatt, R.M.</author><author>Landay, A.L.</author><author>Gange, S.J.</author><author>Deeks, S.G.</author><author>Golub, E.T.</author><author>Pillai, S.K.</author><author>Norris, P.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytokines elevated in HIV elite controllers reduce HIV replication in vitro and modulate HIV restriction factor expression</title><secondary-title>Journal of Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Virology</full-title></periodical><volume>91</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JVI.02051-16</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A subset of HIV-infected individuals termed elite controllers (ECs) maintain CD4+ T cell counts and control viral replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Systemic cytokine responses may differentiate ECs from subjects with uncontrolled viral replication or from those who require ART to suppress viral replication. We measured 87 cytokines in four groups of women: 73 ECs, 42 with pharmacologically suppressed viremia (ART), 42 with uncontrolled viral replication (noncontrollers [NCs]), and 48 HIV-uninfected (NEG) subjects. Four cytokines were elevated in ECs but not NCs or ART subjects: CCL14, CCL21, CCL27, and XCL1. In addition, median stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) levels were 43% higher in ECs than in NCs. The combination of the five cytokines suppressed R5 and X4 virus replication in resting CD4+ T cells, and individually SDF-1β, CCL14, and CCL27 suppressed R5 virus replication, while SDF-1β, CCL21, and CCL14 suppressed X4 virus replication. Functional studies revealed that the combination of the five cytokines upregulated CD69 and CCR5 and downregulated CXCR4 and CCR7 on CD4+ T cells. The CD69 and CXCR4 effects were driven by SDF-1, while CCL21 downregulated CCR7. The combination of the EC-associated cytokines induced expression of the anti-HIV host restriction factors IFITM1 and IFITM2 and suppressed expression of RNase L and SAMHD1. These results identify a set of cytokines that are elevated in ECs and define their effects on cellular activation, HIV coreceptor expression, and innate restriction factor expression. This cytokine pattern may be a signature characteristic of HIV-1 elite control, potentially important for HIV therapeutic and curative strategies. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

Despite their wide use, little basic research has explored canine olfactory generalization and discrimination. In the present study, we assessed canine odor discrimination amongst a series of chemically-related aliphatic alcohols. Domestic dogs were trained to discriminate 1-pentanol from air in a two-choice operant discrimination procedure until reaching an 85% accuracy criterion. In a series of transfer tasks, we assessed dogs' generalization and discrimination between related odorants by replacing the S- stimulus with an alcohol related to pentanol, differing only in the length of the carbon chain. Dogs showed an increase in discrimination performance with an increase in the difference in the number of carbon atoms between pentanol and the comparison alcohol (p &lt; 0.001). These results indicate that this graded series of alcohols may be a useful stimulus set for studying olfactory generalization and discrimination processes in dogs, and that dogs show the same relationship between chemical similarity and discrimination performance as has been observed with humans, monkeys, honeybees, elephants, and rats. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962252623&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.applanim.2016.03.016&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=19d15094966a94410872450f7851c6c9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Falony, G.</author><author>Joossens, M.</author><author>Vieira-Silva, S.</author><author>Wang, J.</author><author>Darzi, Y.</author><author>Faust, K.</author><author>Kurilshikov, A.</author><author>Bonder, M.J.</author><author>Valles-Colomer, M.</author><author>Vandeputte, D.</author><author>Tito, R.Y.</author><author>Chaffron, S.</author><author>Rymenans, L.</author><author>Verspecht, C.</author><author>Sutter, L.D.</author><author>Lima-Mendez, G.</author><author>D'hoe, K.</author><author>Jonckheere, K.</author><author>Homola, D.</author><author>Garcia, R.</author><author>Tigchelaar, E.F.</author><author>Eeckhaudt, L.</author><author>Fu, J.</author><author>Henckaerts, L.</author><author>Zhernakova, A.</author><author>Wijmenga, C.</author><author>Raes, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Population-level analysis of gut microbiome variation</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>560-564</pages><volume>352</volume><number>6285</number><issue>6285</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.aad3503</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fecal microbiome variation in the average, healthy population has remained underinvestigated.

Reichenbach, 1938). Conceptual replications strive for generalization and can be useful in the context of discovery. Direct replications, by contrast, target the replicability of a specific empirical research result under independent conditions and are thus indispensable in the context of justification. Without assuming replicability, it is impossible to reach a consensus about generally accepted empirical facts. However, such accepted facts are mandatory for testing theories in the empirical sciences. On the basis of this framework, we suggest and motivate standards for replication studies. A characteristic feature of psychological science is the probabilistic nature of the to-be-replicated empirical claim, which typically takes the form of a statistical hypothesis. This raises a number of methodological problems concerning the nature of the replicability hypothesis, the control of error probabilities in statistical decisions about the replicability hypothesis, the determination of the to-bedetected effect size given distortions of published effect sizes by publication bias, the a priori determination of sample sizes for replication studies, and the correct interpretation of the replication rate (i. e., the success rate in a series of replication studies). We propose and discuss solutions for all these problems. © 2018 Hogrefe Verlag.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040168174&amp;doi=10.1026%2f0033-3042%2fa000387&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7b8b1763ed541094af59574af8d4e16e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kassar, T.C.</author><author>Magalhães, T.</author><author>Júnior, J.V.J.S.</author><author>Carvalho, A.G.O.</author><author>da Silva, A.N.M.R.</author><author>Queiroz, S.R.A.</author><author>Bertani, G.R.</author><author>Gil, L.H.V.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Construction and characterization of a recombinant yellow fever virus stably expressing Gaussia luciferase</title><secondary-title>Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias</full-title></periodical><pages>2119-2130</pages><volume>89</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/0001-3765201720160196</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Yellow fever is an arthropod-borne viral disease that still poses high public health concerns, despite the availability of an effective vaccine. The development of recombinant viruses is of utmost importance for several types of studies, such as those aimed to dissect virus-host interactions and to search for novel antiviral strategies. Moreover, recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes may greatly facilitate these studies. Here, we report the construction of a recombinant yellow fever virus (YFV) expressing Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) (YFV-GLuc). We show, through RT-PCR, sequencing and measurement of GLuc activity, that stability of the heterologous gene was maintained after six passages. Furthermore, a direct association between GLuc expression and viral replication was observed (r2=0.9967), indicating that measurement of GLuc activity may be used to assess viral replication in different applications. In addition, we evaluated the use of the recombinant virus in an antiviral assay with recombinant human alfa-2b interferon. A 60% inhibition of GLuc expression was observed in cells infected with YFV-GLuc and incubated with IFN alfa-2b. Previously tested on YFV inhibition by plaque assays indicated a similar fold-decrease in viral replication. These results are valuable as they show the stability of YFV-GLuc and one of several possible applications of this construct. © 2017, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

The EMR disparity was emulated using different permutations of the EMR collected at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU). The algorithms were trained using patients from the PICU to predict in-ICU mortality for patients on a held out set of PICU and CTICU patients.

Methods: As part of a special issue on model sharing and reproducibility in the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, two manuscripts on computational biomechanics were submitted: Rajagopal et al., IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016 and Schmitz and Piovesan, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016. Models used in these studies were shared with the scientific reviewers and the public. In addition to the standard review of the manuscripts, the reviewers downloaded the models and performed simulations that reproduced results reported in the studies. Results: There was general agreement between simulation results of the authors and those of the reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved during the necessary revisions. The manuscripts and instructions for download and simulation were updated in response to the reviewers' feedback; changes that may otherwise have been missed if explicit model sharing and simulation reproducibility analysis was not conducted in the review process. Increased burden on the authors and the reviewers, to facilitate model sharing and to repeat simulations, were noted. Conclusion: When the authors of computational biomechanics studies provide access to models and data, the scientific reviewers can download and thoroughly explore the model, perform simulations, and evaluate simulation reproducibility beyond the traditional manuscript-only review process. Significance: Model sharing and reproducibility analysis in scholarly publishing will result in a more rigorous review process, which will enhance the quality of modeling and simulation studies and inform future users of computational models. © 1964-2012 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989863521&amp;doi=10.1109%2fTBME.2016.2602760&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3eae8c3f5b2a2a726e1f8a5a342a54b3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Calciano, L.</author><author>Corsico, A.G.</author><author>Pirina, P.</author><author>Trucco, G.</author><author>Jarvis, D.</author><author>Janson, C.</author><author>Accordini, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of asthma severity in adults with ever asthma: A continuous score</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0177538</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: In epidemiological studies, continuous measures of asthma severity should be used to catch the heterogeneity of phenotypes. This study aimed at developing and validating continuous measures of asthma severity in adult patients with ever asthma from the general population, to be used in epidemiological studies. Methods: Respiratory symptoms, anti-asthmatic treatment and lung function were measured on 520 patients with ever asthma aged 20-64 years from the general Italian population (GEIRD study; 2007/2010). The variables that represent the same dimension of asthma severity were identified through an exploratory factor analysis and were summarized through a multiple factor analysis. Results: Only respiratory symptoms and anti-asthmatic treatment were summarized in a continuous score (STS). STS ranges from 0 (no symptoms/treatment) to 10 (maximum symptom frequency and treatment intensity). STS was positively correlated with the Global Initiative for Asthma classification of asthma severity computed on the 137 cases with a doctor's diagnosis (Spearman's coefficient = 0.61, p-value&lt;0.0001) (concurrent validity). Furthermore, using a cohort of 1,097 European asthmatics (ECRHS II study; 1999/2002), increasing STS levels at baseline (1991/1993) were positively associated with long-term outcomes (hospitalization and lost workdays for breathing problems, asthma attack frequency and use of asthma controllers) (predictive validity). Finally, the STS scores computed from the GEIRD and ECRHS II data were comparable (Lin's coefficient = 0.95, p-value&lt;0.0001) (replication analysis). Conclusions: STS is a valid and replicable measure of asthma severity in adults, which could be used in association studies. © 2017 Calciano et al.

Previous studies have suggested that the reproductive rate is tightly coupled to the abundance of Calanus finmarchicus in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), which has been shown to respond to ecosystem regime shifts associated with decadal-scale climate forcing from the Arctic. Given the endangered status of the right whale population, it is vital to determine how climate-associated changes in prey availability will affect this species in the future. Here, we investigate a 3-state reproduction model that explores multiple environmental proxies as potential predictors of annual calf production during the period from 980 to 2007. The model achieves its best fit to observations using temporally and spatially resolved C. finmarchicus abundance data derived from Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) surveys of the GOM. Building on previous research, this prey-dependent model, which uses bimonthly and geographically specific abundance anomalies of C. finmarchicus, significantly improves estimates of annual calf production relative to a null model. The temporal and geographic distributions of prey objectively chosen for inclusion in the new version of the model correspond well with observed right whale seasonal distribution patterns, providing further evidence that the model captures essential features of right whale reproductive ecology. © Inter-Research 2015.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84975775417&amp;doi=10.3354%2fmeps11372&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=abdd00076ea4033f6c152b823e7ce4d0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boddez, Y.</author><author>Bennett, M.P.</author><author>van Esch, S.</author><author>Beckers, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bending rules: the shape of the perceptual generalisation gradient is sensitive to inference rules</title><secondary-title>Cognition and Emotion</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cognition and Emotion</full-title></periodical><pages>1444-1452</pages><volume>31</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02699931.2016.1230541</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Generalising what is learned about one stimulus to other but perceptually related stimuli is a basic behavioural phenomenon. We evaluated whether a rule learning mechanism may serve to explain such generalisation. To this end, we assessed whether inference rules communicated through verbal instructions affect generalisation. Expectancy ratings, but not valence ratings, proved sensitive to this manipulation. In addition to revealing a role for inference rules in generalisation, our study has clinical implications as well. More specifically, we argue that targeting inference rules might prove to be an effective strategy to affect the excessive generalisation that is often observed in psychopathology. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988951338&amp;doi=10.1080%2f02699931.2016.1230541&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=896000b31c66ffcb2d94e3bc9f3d2abb</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, N.</author><author>Xiong, Y.</author><author>Qing, G.</author><author>Zhao, Y.</author><author>Li, X.</author><author>Liang, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Selective enrichment of sialylated glycopeptides with a d-allose@SiO2 matrix</title><secondary-title>RSC Advances</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>RSC Advances</full-title></periodical><pages>38780-38786</pages><volume>8</volume><number>68</number><issue>68</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c8ra07192f</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abnormal sialylation of glycoprotein is associated with different kinds of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. However, analysis of low abundance sialylated glycopeptides (SGPs) from complex biological samples is still a big challenge. To solve the problem, materials with high SGPs enrichment selectivity should be designed and prepared. Inspired by the saccharide-saccharide interaction in life systems, a d-allose@SiO2 (ABS) material was prepared and applied in SGPs enrichment under hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and nitrogen adsorption experiment results proved that the ABS matrix was successfully synthesized. The SGPs enrichment selectivity of ABS matrix was evaluated with Nano Electrospray Ionization Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (Nano ESI Q-TOF/MS). The results indicated that the SGPs enrichment selectivity was notably higher with the ABS matrix (24 SGPs) than the commercially available Sepharose CL-6B (9 SGPs) and TiO2 (8 SGPs), taking digests of fetuin/bovine serum albumin (BSA) (1:10, w/w) as the test sample. The SGPs enrichment performance of ABS matrix was further validated by the interference, recovery rate, and reproducibility evaluation experiments. In the end, the ABS matrix was applied in the analysis of real biosample (HeLa cell lysates). Totally 301 SGPs with 277 glycosylation sites from 186 glycoprotein were successfully characterized by taking HeLa S3 cell lysate as target sample in two replicated experiments. The results indicated that the ABS matrix had great potential to be applied in the enrichment of SGPs from complex biological samples. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057183249&amp;doi=10.1039%2fc8ra07192f&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=12b4c5f87ba75be53c97f755472b0c33</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kaczkurkin, A.N.</author><author>Burton, P.C.</author><author>Chazin, S.M.</author><author>Manbeck, A.B.</author><author>Espensen-Sturges, T.</author><author>Cooper, S.E.</author><author>Sponheim, S.R.</author><author>Lissek, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neural substrates of overgeneralized conditioned fear in PTSD</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><pages>125-134</pages><volume>174</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.15121549</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: Heightened generalization of fear from an aversively reinforced conditioned stimulus (CS+, a conditioned danger cue) to resembling stimuli is widely accepted as a pathogenic marker of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Indeed, a distress response to benign stimuli that "resemble" aspects of the trauma is a central feature of the disorder. To date, the link between overgeneralization of conditioned fear and PTSD derives largely from clinical observations, with limited empirical work on the subject. This represents the first effort to examine behavioral and brain indices of generalized conditioned fear in PTSD using systematic methods developed in animals known as generalization gradients: the gradual decline in conditioned responding as the presented stimulus gradually differentiates from CS+. Method: Gradients of conditioned fear generalization were assessed using functional MRI and behavioral measures in U.S. combat veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan and had PTSD (N=26), subthreshold PTSD (N=19), or no PTSD (referred to as trauma control subjects) (N=17). Presented stimuli included rings of graded size, with extreme sizes serving as CS+ (paired with shock) and as a nonreinforced conditioned stimulus (CS-, a conditioned safety cue), and with intermediate sizes forming a continuum of similarity between CS+ and CS-. Generalization gradients were assessed as response slopes from CS+, through intermediate ring sizes, to CS-, with less steep slopes indicative of stronger generalization. Results: Relative to trauma control subjects, PTSD patients showed stronger conditioned generalization, as evidenced by less steep generalization gradients in both behavioral risk ratings and brain responses in the left and right anterior insula, left ventral hippocampus, dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus. Severity of PTSD symptoms across the three study groups was positively correlated with levels of generalization at two such loci: the right anterior insula and left ventral hippocampus. Conclusions: The results point to evidence of brain-based markers of overgeneralized fear conditioning related to PTSD. These findings provide further understanding of a central yet understudied symptom of trauma-related psychopathology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011588842&amp;doi=10.1176%2fappi.ajp.2016.15121549&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=98d0bebdafa296ee0b036e4a427d2ff0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Y.</author><author>Wen, F.</author><author>Zhang, P.</author><author>Tang, R.</author><author>Li, Q.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vesicular stomatitis virus is a potent agent for the treatment of malignant ascites</title><secondary-title>Oncology Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncology Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1573-1581</pages><volume>35</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/or.2015.4522</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cancer cells in ascites are usually exposed to a hypoxia tumor microenvironment and utilize enhanced glycolysis which produces energy and metabolizes nutrients to support proliferation. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an oncolytic virus that relies on the host cellular metabolism for replication. We tested the efficacy of VSV on peritoneal carcinomatosis and assessed VSV replication in cancer cells from ascites. BALB/c female mice bearing peritoneal H22 or MethA cells received an i.p. administration of 1x108 PFU VSV or 1x108 PFU equivalent of UV-inactivated VSV on day 10, 12 and 14 after incubation. Administration of VSV resulted in a significant inhibition of ascites formation and prolonged survival of the treated mice. The replication of VSV was obviously enhanced in the cancer cells from the ascites. Considering the central carbon metabolic pathways, cancer cells in the malignant ascites provided more exogenous glucose, glutamine and pyruvate after VSV infection due to its unregulated glycolytic activity and glutamine metabolism. Pharmacologically, inhibition of the glycolytic pathway and glutamine metabolism reduced VSV replication, and this inhibited replication was rescued by the addition of multiple tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. Our results demonstrated that metabolic adaptive processes in peritoneal carcinoma, such as high glycolytic activity and glutamine metabolism, favor VSV replication. These results suggest the clinical potency of VSV in the treatment of malignant ascites and provide new insights into the further exploration of the potential application of VSV in the treatment of hypoxia ascites cancer cells.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955443926&amp;doi=10.3892%2for.2015.4522&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ea499a6af21094b9e55d501d1758f25d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kahan, D.</author><author>McKenzie, T.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Physical Activity and Psychological Correlates During an After-School Running Club</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Health Education</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Health Education</full-title></periodical><pages>113-123</pages><volume>49</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/19325037.2017.1414646</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: After-school programs (ASPs) have the potential to contribute to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), but there is limited empirical evidence to guide their development and implementation. Purpose: This study assessed the replication of an elementary school running program and identified psychological correlates of children’s MVPA. Methods: We used pedometry to measure participant PA%, MVPA%, and MVPA% of PA during a 20-session alternating treatments design and examined associations between various psychological constructs and MVPA levels using odds ratios. Results: PA% (62.2% vs 76.1%, effect size [ES] = −0.65) was lower and MVPA% (33.3% vs 15.8%, ES = 0.75) and MVPA% of PA (53.6% vs 20.2%, ES = 0.91) were higher during game vs lap running conditions. The constructs of recognition, ego orientation, and expectancy beliefs distinguished between children with high and low MVPA. Discussion: The replication of results for MVPA with a different cohort provides evidence of program generalizability. Only game days met the ASP national recommendation for providing activities at an intensity of 50% MVPA% or greater. Translation to Health Education Practice: Running laps and running games both contribute to PA accrual, but they do so in different ways. ASP providers should weigh the demands and outcomes of each format. © SHAPE America.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042367025&amp;doi=10.1080%2f19325037.2017.1414646&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3259936fb5e6ec28c41d42b99620fac1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Camerer, C.F.</author><author>Dreber, A.</author><author>Forsell, E.</author><author>Ho, T.-H.</author><author>Huber, J.</author><author>Johannesson, M.</author><author>Kirchler, M.</author><author>Almenberg, J.</author><author>Altmejd, A.</author><author>Chan, T.</author><author>Heikensten, E.</author><author>Holzmeister, F.</author><author>Imai, T.</author><author>Isaksson, S.</author><author>Nave, G.</author><author>Pfeiffer, T.</author><author>Razen, M.</author><author>Wu, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating replicability of laboratory experiments in economics</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1433-1436</pages><volume>351</volume><number>6280</number><issue>6280</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.aaf0918</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The replicability of some scientific findings has recently been called into question.To contribute data about replicability in economics, we replicated 18 studies published in the American Economic Review and the Quarterly Journal of Economics between 2011 and 2014.

While a variety of potential replacement therapies are being explored, expansion of endogenous insulin-producing pancreatic islet β-cells remains an attractive strategy. β-cells have limited spontaneous regenerative activity; consequently, a crucial research effort is to develop a precise understanding of the molecular pathways that restrain β-cell growth and to identify drugs capable of overcoming these restraints. Herein an automated high-content image-based primary-cell screening method to identify β-cell replication-promoting small molecules is presented. Several, limitations of prior methodologies are surmounted. First, use of primary islet cells rather than an immortalized cell-line maximizes retention of in vivo growth restraints. Second, use of mixed-composition islet-cell cultures rather than a β-cell-line allows identification of both lineage-restricted and general growth stimulators. Third, the technique makes practical the use of primary islets, a limiting resource, through use of a 384-well format. Fourth, detrimental experimental variability associated with erratic islet culture quality is overcome through optimization of isolation, dispersion, plating and culture parameters. Fifth, the difficulties of accurately and consistently measuring the low basal replication rate of islet endocrine-cells are surmounted with optimized immunostaining parameters, automated data acquisition and data analysis; automation simultaneously enhances throughput and limits experimenter bias. Notable limitations of this assay are the use of dispersed islet cultures which disrupts islet architecture, the use of rodent rather than human islets and the inherent limitations of throughput and cost associated with the use of primary cells. Importantly, the strategy is easily adapted for human islet replication studies. This assay is well suited for investigating the mitogenic effect of substances on β-cells and the molecular mechanisms that regulate β-cell growth. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979937111&amp;doi=10.3791%2f54298&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=13a77906b8e79ceaffac26a5e45dac68</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bui, E.T.</author><author>Fazio, R.H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization of Evaluative Conditioning Toward Foods: Increasing Sensitivity to Health in Eating Intentions</title><secondary-title>Health Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health Psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>852-855</pages><volume>35</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1037/hea0000339</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: Evaluative conditioning (EC), the pairing of objects (conditioned stimuli; CS) with positive and negative unconditioned stimuli (US) in order to induce attitude change, has proven to be a viable method of changing attitudes toward foods and corresponding eating behaviors. Positively conditioning healthy foods and negatively conditioning unhealthy foods should result in healthier food choices. Of interest in the current research is the extent to which EC can generalize beyond the conditioned foods to entire dimensions underlying food judgment, such as health and taste. Method: The current research included 2 EC experiments configured in accord with the Implicit Misattribution Model (IMM; Jones, Fazio, &amp; Olson, 2009). Four healthy CS foods were paired with positive US and 4 unhealthy CS foods were paired with negative US. Participants then reported eating intentions for a variety of foods, including non-CS foods. Results: Experiment 1 demonstrated that conditioning a few exemplar food items increased sensitivity to health and decreased sensitivity to taste when judging a variety of additional foods. Experiment 2 replicated the generalization effect with regard to health sensitivity, but only when a task that preceded the EC procedure promoted, rather than interfered with, categorization of the CS foods by health. Conclusions: This research shows that EC can generalize to an entire dimension underlying food judgment and that this effect is facilitated by accessibility of the health dimension at the time of exposure to the EC pairings. © 2016 American Psychological Association.

This study was undertaken to quantify the transmission between animals and to estimate the infection reproduction ratio in a predominantly mixed crop-livestock system and in intensive commercial herd types. The transmission parameters were based on a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) epidemic model with environmental transmission and estimated using generalized linear models. The transmission parameters were estimated using a survival rate of infectious virus in the environment equal to 0·325 per day, a value based on the best-fitting statistical model. The transmission rate parameter between animals was 0·072 (95% CI 0·068-0·076) per day in the crop-livestock production system, whereas this transmission rate in intensive production system was 0·076 (95% CI 0·068-0·085) per day. The reproduction ratio (R) of LSD between animals in the crop-livestock production system was 1·07, whereas it was 1·09 between animals in the intensive production system. The calculated R provides a baseline against which various control options can be assessed for efficacy.

The Gotland Basin spawning ground is one of three main spawning areas of Baltic cod, Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758. The threshold water parameters for cod development are the salinity exceeding 11‰ and the oxygen level above 2 mL· L–1. Such conditions are only present when the 11‰ isohaline is above the 2 mL· L–1 isooxygen. In such situation the water volume between the isolines is called the “suitable reproduction volume”. When the position of the isolines is reversed, the salinity and the oxygen level of the water layer demarcated by them are below the required thresholds and as such the water is unsuitable for the cod development. We refer to it as the “unsuitable reproduction volume”. The main aim of the presently reported study was to examine whether variations in suitable and unsuitable reproduction habitat estimates could explain the fl uctuations in cod recruitment. Material and methods. The suitable and unsuitable reproduction volumes in the Gotland Basin were estimated based on single point observations at three oceanographic monitoring stations using the contouring software Balthypsograph. To test the spatial hydrological heterogeneity in the Gotland Basin we used 15 observations during 1969–1995 on four stations in each of two transects. The oceanographic monitoring and demersal trawl research survey data from 1974–2012 have been used in analyses. Results. The sufficient reproduction conditions in the southern Gotland Basin persisted only until 1981. In later decades the reproduction potential of the Gotland Basin has decreased. The latest major North Sea water infl ows in 1993 and 2003 in the Central Gotland Basin formed the suitable reproduction volume below the layers where cod eggs are fl oating. A significant relation between the recruit abundance and suitable and the unsuitable reproduction volumes was found only for the Southern Gotland Basin (P &lt; 0.03). Conclusions. We demonstrated that single-point estimates sufficiently quantify the reproduction conditions in the Gotland Basin and thus can be used for estimation of the reproduction volumes. The unsuitable reproduction volume concept can be used as an ecological indicator for egg survival probability in the Gotland Basin. However, it is too premature to re-define the concept of the suitable reproduction volume because it is applicable only to the Gotland spawning ground. © 2005, Scientific Society of Szczecin.

Without effective vaccines being available, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends the full depopulation of infected herds as the only strategy to eradicate B. suis outbreaks. Using data collected from 8 herds suffering natural swine brucellosis outbreaks, we assessed the efficacy of four control strategies: (i) oxytetracycline treatment only, as a default scenario, (ii) oxytetracycline treatment combined with skin testing and removal of positive animals, (iii) oxytetracycline treatment combined with serological testing (Rose Bengal test-RBT-and indirect ELISA -iELISA-) and removal of seropositive animals and (iv) oxytetracycline treatment combined with both serological (RBT/iELISA) and skin testing and removal of positive animals. A Susceptible-Infectious-Removal model was used to estimate the reproduction ratio (R) for each strategy. According to this model, the oxytetracycline treatment alone was not effective enough to eradicate the infection. However, this antibiotic treatment combined with diagnostic testing at 4-monthly intervals plus immediate removal of positive animals showed to be effective to eradicate brucellosis independent of the diagnostic test strategy used in an acceptable time interval (1-2 years), depending on the initial number of infected animals. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959920130&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.prevetmed.2016.01.033&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1009dcf3af32eac8405c43e7d65ad997</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McNeeley, S.</author><author>Warner, J.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication in criminology: A necessary practice</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Criminology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Criminology</full-title></periodical><pages>581-597</pages><volume>12</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1477370815578197</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although researchers acknowledge the importance of replication in building scientific knowledge, replication studies seem to be published infrequently. The present study examines the extent to which replications are conducted in criminology. We conduct a content analysis of the five most influential journals in criminology. We also compare the replication rate in criminology with that in the social sciences and natural sciences. The results show that replication research is rarely published in these disciplines. In criminology journals in particular, replication studies constitute just over 2 percent of the articles published between 2006 and 2010. Further, those replication studies that were published in criminology journals in that period tended to conflict with the original studies. These findings call into question the utility of empirical results published in criminology journals for developing theory and policy. Strategies for promoting replication research in criminology are suggested. © The Author(s) 2015.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947459469&amp;doi=10.1177%2f1477370815578197&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7a27f1400ee6904479de93f1f6dcf79c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Riaz, M.</author><author>King, J.</author><author>Slankas, J.</author><author>Williams, L.</author><author>Massacci, F.</author><author>Quesada-López, C.</author><author>Jenkins, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying the implied: Findings from three differentiated replications on the use of security requirements templates</title><secondary-title>Empirical Software Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Empirical Software Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>2127-2178</pages><volume>22</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10664-016-9481-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Identifying security requirements early on can lay the foundation for secure software development. Security requirements are often implied by existing functional requirements but are mostly left unspecified. The Security Discoverer (SD) process automatically identifies security implications of individual requirements sentences and suggests applicable security requirements templates. The objective of this research is to support requirements analysts in identifying security requirements by automating the suggestion of security requirements templates that are implied by existing functional requirements. We conducted a controlled experiment in a graduate-level security class at North Carolina State University (NCSU) to evaluate the SD process in eliciting implied security requirements in 2014. We have subsequently conducted three differentiated replications to evaluate the generalizability and applicability of the initial findings. The replications were conducted across three countries at the University of Trento, NCSU, and the University of Costa Rica. We evaluated the responses of the 205 total participants in terms of quality, coverage, relevance and efficiency. We also develop shared insights regarding the impact of context factors such as time, motivation and support, on the study outcomes and provide lessons learned in conducting the replications. Treatment group, using the SD process, performed significantly better than the control group (at p-value &lt;0.05) in terms of the coverage of the identified security requirements and efficiency of the requirements elicitation process in two of the three replications, supporting the findings of the original study. Participants in the treatment group identified 84 % more security requirements in the oracle as compared to the control group on average. Overall, 80 % of the 111 participants in the treatment group were favorable towards the use of templates in identifying security requirements. Our qualitative findings indicate that participants may be able to differentiate between relevant and extraneous templates suggestions and be more inclined to fill in the templates with additional support. Security requirements templates capture the security knowledge of multiple experts and can support the security requirements elicitation process when automatically suggested, making the implied security requirements more evident. However, individual participants may still miss out on identifying a number of security requirements due to empirical constraints as well as potential limitations on knowledge and security expertise. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006428056&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10664-016-9481-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a0080dbbd122ab89544ac080e2e61d12</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pulay, A.J.</author><author>Koller, J.</author><author>Nagy, L.</author><author>Molnár, M.J.</author><author>Réthelyi, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multilocus genetic analysis implicates neurodevelopment and immune system in the etiology of schizophrenia</title><secondary-title>Ideggyogyaszati Szemle</secondary-title><short-title>A szkizofrénia multilókusz genetikai vizsgálata az idegfejlödés és az immunrendszer zavarának oki szerepére utal(hat)</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ideggyogyaszati Szemle</full-title></periodical><pages>115-126</pages><volume>70</volume><number>3-4</number><issue>3-4</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.18071/isz.70.0115</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background - Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder of poorly understood etiology, characterized by high heritability, multifactorial inheritance and high heterogeneity. Multilocus associaton methods may reduce the genetic heterogeneity and improve the probability of replication between analyses. Objectives -The aims of our study were twofold: 1. To analyse genetic risk factors of schizophrenia by using multi- locus genetic tests. 2. To assess the replication probability attributable to the various multilocus tests. Subjects - Discovery set: case-parent trios of unaffected parents and affected probands with a DSM-IV schizophrenia diagnosis (n=16); replication set: schizophrenia cases and unaffected controls (n=5337). Methods -Associations of single nucleotide and indel markers were transferred to gene-And geneset-based associations, furthermore to geneset-enrichment tests and functional annotation cluster analyses in a two-staged designs. Associations with p&lt;0.1 from the discovery set were tested in the replication sample. Familywise p-value correction for multiple comparisons were performed during the replication step. Results -After correction for multiplicity, no significant association or enrichment were detected for gene-based nor canonical pathway analyses, but significant association of the 14q31 cytoband and enrichments of the 5q31 and Xql3 cytobands were found (pcorr: 0.002, 0.006 and 0.048, respectively). Functional annotation clustering yielded statistically significant enrichment scores for clusters of splicing/alternative splicing, neurodevelopment and embryonic development. Improvements in replication probabilty were found with increased test complexity (Prep: 0, 0.015, 0.21). Conclusions - Our results corroborate the involvement of neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and immune mechanisms in the etiology of schizophrenia. Also, our findings indicated improvement of replication probability by using multilocus genetic analyses.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018798805&amp;doi=10.18071%2fisz.70.0115&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=96617fd4500489991e9d265572478d42</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vera, J.</author><author>Brulez, A.-C.</author><author>Contraires, E.</author><author>Larochette, M.</author><author>Trannoy-Orban, N.</author><author>Pignon, M.</author><author>Mauclair, C.</author><author>Valette, S.</author><author>Benayoun, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors influencing microinjection molding replication quality</title><secondary-title>Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering</full-title></periodical><volume>28</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/1361-6439/aa9a4e</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In recent years, there has been increased interest in producing and providing high-precision plastic parts that can be manufactured by microinjection molding: gears, pumps, optical grating elements, and so on. For all of these applications, the replication quality is essential. This study has two goals: (1) fabrication of high-precision parts using the conventional injection molding machine; (2) identification of robust parameters that ensure production quality. Thus, different technological solutions have been used: cavity vacuuming and the use of a mold coated with DLC or CrN deposits. AFM and SEM analyses were carried out to characterize the replication profile. The replication quality was studied in terms of the process parameters, coated and uncoated molds and crystallinity of the polymer. Specific studies were processed to quantify the replicability of injection molded parts (ABS, PC and PP). Analysis of the Taguchi experimental designs permits prioritization of the impact of each parameter on the replication quality. A discussion taking into account these new parameters and the thermal and spreading properties on the coatings is proposed. It appeared that, in general, increasing the mold temperature improves the molten polymer fill in submicron features except for the steel insert (for which the presence of a vacuum is the most important factor). Moreover, the DLC coating was the best coating to increase the quality of the replication. This result could be explained by the lower thermal diffusivity of this coating. We noted that the viscosity of the polymers is not a primordial factor of the replication quality. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038633377&amp;doi=10.1088%2f1361-6439%2faa9a4e&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=327ece3a4ca1de7a3e4cb820d28246aa</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dempsey, I.</author><author>Valentine, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Special Education Outcomes and Young Australian School Students: A Propensity Score Analysis Replication</title><secondary-title>Australasian Journal of Special Education</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australasian Journal of Special Education</full-title></periodical><pages>68-86</pages><volume>41</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/jse.2017.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Using a second cohort of Australian school students, this study repeated the propensity score analysis reported by Dempsey, Valentine, and Colyvas (2016) that found that 2 years after receiving special education support, a group of infant grade students performed significantly less well in academic and social skills in comparison to matched groups of students who did not receive support.

A finding is elevated from single observation to scientific evidence when the procedures that were used to obtain it can be reproduced and the finding itself can be replicated. Recent replication attempts show that some high profile results - most notably in psychology, but in many other disciplines as well - cannot be replicated consistently. These replication attempts have generated a considerable amount of controversy, and the issue of whether direct replications have value has, in particular, proven to be contentious. However, much of this discussion has occurred in published commentaries and social media outlets, resulting in a fragmented discourse. To address the need for an integrative summary, we review various types of replication studies and then discuss the most commonly voiced concerns about direct replication. We provide detailed responses to these concerns and consider different statistical ways to evaluate replications. We conclude there are no theoretical or statistical obstacles to making direct replication a routine aspect of psychological science. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033378669&amp;doi=10.1017%2fS0140525X17001972&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4e327db6bc140ce52d463e3bc9bf79df</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Y.</author><author>Nonnemacher, M.R.</author><author>Alexaki, A.</author><author>Pirrone, V.</author><author>Banerjee, A.</author><author>Li, L.</author><author>Kilareski, E.</author><author>Wigdahl, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional Studies of CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Site Located Downstream of the Transcriptional Start Site</title><secondary-title>Clinical Medicine Insights: Pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Medicine Insights: Pathology</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1179555717694556</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Previous studies have identified a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site located downstream of the transcriptional start site (DS3). The role of the DS3 element with respect to HIV-1 transactivation by Tat and viral replication has not been characterized. We have demonstrated that DS3 was a functional C/EBPβ binding site and mutation of this site to the C/EBP knockout DS3-9C variant showed lower HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation by C/EBPβ. However, it was able to exhibit similar or even higher transcription levels by Tat compared to the parental LTR. C/EBPβ and Tat together further enhanced the transcription level of the parental LAI-LTR and DS3-9C LTR, with higher levels in the DS3-9C LTR. HIV molecular clone viruses carrying the DS3-9C variant LTR demonstrated a decreased replication capacity and delayed rate of replication. These results suggest that DS3 plays a role in virus transcriptional initiation and provides new insight into C/EBP regulation of HIV-1. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044505420&amp;doi=10.1177%2f1179555717694556&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=942319d40e90d994058d7cc13e57073c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kannan, P.</author><author>Sgammato, A.</author><author>Tannenbaum, R.J.</author><author>Katz, I.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the Consistency of Angoff-Based Cut Scores Using Subsets of Items Within a Generalizability Theory Framework</title><secondary-title>Applied Measurement in Education</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Measurement in Education</full-title></periodical><pages>169-186</pages><volume>28</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/08957347.2015.1042156</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Angoff method requires experts to view every item on the test and make a probability judgment. This can be time consuming when there are large numbers of items on the test. In this study, a G-theory framework was used to determine if a subset of items can be used to make generalizable cut-score recommendations. Angoff ratings (i.e., probability judgments) from previously conducted standard setting studies were used first in a re-sampling study, followed by D-studies. For the re-sampling study, proportionally stratified subsets of items were extracted under various sampling and test-length conditions. The mean cut score, variance components, expected standard error (SE) around the mean cut score, and root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) across 1,000 replications were estimated at each study condition. The SE and the RMSD decreased as the number of items increased, but this reduction tapered off after approximately 45 items. Subsequently, D-studies were performed on the same datasets. The expected SE was computed at various test lengths. Results from both studies are consistent with previous research indicating that between 40–50 items are sufficient to make generalizable cut score recommendations.

Methods: A HSV-1 UL7 mutant (UL7-MU) was constructed using the CRISPR-cas9 system. The replication rate and plaque morphology were used to analyze the biological characteristics of the wild-type (WT), UL7-MU and MU-complemented P1 viruses. The virulence of the viruses was evaluated in mice. Real-time RT-qPCR and ChIP assays were used to determine the expression levels of relevant genes. Results: The replication capacity of a recombinant virus (UL7-MU strain) was 10-fold lower than that of the WT strain. The neurovirulence and pathologic effect of the UL7-MU strain were attenuated in infected mice compared with the WT strain. In the latency model, the expression of latency-associated transcript (LAT) in the central nervous system (CNS) and trigeminal nerve was lower in UL7-MU-infected mice than in WT strain-infected mice. The transcription level of the immediate-early gene α-4 in UL7-MU-infected cells was reduced by approximately 2-fold compared with the clear transcriptional peak identified in WT strain-infected Vero cells within 7 h post-infection (p.i.). Conclusion: By modulating the transcription of the α-4 gene, UL7 may be involved in transcriptional regulation through its interaction with the transcript complex structure of the viral genome during HSV-1 infection. © 2016 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986903231&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12985-016-0600-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7c2e81417a560aee3f864733631944cb</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pino-Yanes, M.</author><author>Gignoux, C.R.</author><author>Galanter, J.M.</author><author>Levin, A.M.</author><author>Campbell, C.D.</author><author>Eng, C.</author><author>Huntsman, S.</author><author>Nishimura, K.K.</author><author>Gourraud, P.-A.</author><author>Mohajeri, K.</author><author>O'Roak, B.J.</author><author>Hu, D.</author><author>Mathias, R.A.</author><author>Nguyen, E.A.</author><author>Roth, L.A.</author><author>Padhukasahasram, B.</author><author>Moreno-Estrada, A.</author><author>Sandoval, K.</author><author>Winkler, C.A.</author><author>Lurmann, F.</author><author>Davis, A.</author><author>Farber, H.J.</author><author>Meade, K.</author><author>Avila, P.C.</author><author>Serebrisky, D.</author><author>Chapela, R.</author><author>Ford, J.G.</author><author>Lenoir, M.A.</author><author>Thyne, S.M.</author><author>Brigino-Buenaventura, E.</author><author>Borrell, L.N.</author><author>Rodriguez-Cintron, W.</author><author>Sen, S.</author><author>Kumar, R.</author><author>Rodriguez-Santana, J.R.</author><author>Bustamante, C.D.</author><author>Martinez, F.D.</author><author>Raby, B.A.</author><author>Weiss, S.T.</author><author>Nicolae, D.L.</author><author>Ober, C.</author><author>Meyers, D.A.</author><author>Bleecker, E.R.</author><author>Mack, S.J.</author><author>Hernandez, R.D.</author><author>Eichler, E.E.</author><author>Barnes, K.C.</author><author>Williams, L.K.</author><author>Torgerson, D.G.</author><author>Burchard, E.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide association study and admixture mapping reveal new loci associated with total IgE levels in Latinos</title><secondary-title>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1502-1510</pages><volume>135</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jaci.2014.10.033</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background IgE is a key mediator of allergic inflammation, and its levels are frequently increased in patients with allergic disorders. Objective We sought to identify genetic variants associated with IgE levels in Latinos. Methods We performed a genome-wide association study and admixture mapping of total IgE levels in 3334 Latinos from the Genes-environments &amp; Admixture in Latino Americans (GALA II) study. Replication was evaluated in 454 Latinos, 1564 European Americans, and 3187 African Americans from independent studies. Results We confirmed associations of 6 genes identified by means of previous genome-wide association studies and identified a novel genome-wide significant association of a polymorphism in the zinc finger protein 365 gene (ZNF365) with total IgE levels (rs200076616, P = 2.3 × 10-8). We next identified 4 admixture mapping peaks (6p21.32-p22.1, 13p22-31, 14q23.2, and 22q13.1) at which local African, European, and/or Native American ancestry was significantly associated with IgE levels. The most significant peak was 6p21.32-p22.1, where Native American ancestry was associated with lower IgE levels (P = 4.95 × 10-8). All but 22q13.1 were replicated in an independent sample of Latinos, and 2 of the peaks were replicated in African Americans (6p21.32-p22.1 and 14q23.2). Fine mapping of 6p21.32-p22.1 identified 6 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms in Latinos, 2 of which replicated in European Americans. Another single nucleotide polymorphism was peak-wide significant within 14q23.2 in African Americans (rs1741099, P = 3.7 × 10-6) and replicated in non-African American samples (P =.011). Conclusion We confirmed genetic associations at 6 genes and identified novel associations within ZNF365, HLA-DQA1, and 14q23.2. Our results highlight the importance of studying diverse multiethnic populations to uncover novel loci associated with total IgE levels. © 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941343274&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jaci.2014.10.033&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ed3fe490fa0db4c0505fdf19eebbdfb6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beelmann, A.</author><author>Malti, T.</author><author>Noam, G.G.</author><author>Sommer, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Innovation and integrity: Desiderata and future directions for prevention and intervention science</title><secondary-title>Prevention Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Prevention Science</full-title></periodical><pages>358-365</pages><volume>19</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11121-018-0869-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article summarizes essential implications of the papers within this special issue and discusses directions for future prevention and intervention research on conceptual issues, methodological and transfer-related challenges and opportunities. We identify a need to move from programs to principles in intervention research and encourage the implementation of research on potential mechanisms underlying intervention effectiveness. In addition, current methodological issues in intervention research are highlighted, including advancements in methodology and statistical procedures, extended outcome assessments, replication studies, and a thorough examination of potential biases. We further discuss transfer-related issues, for example the need for more research on the flexibility and adaptability of programs and intervention approaches as well as more general problems in knowledge translation reasoning the need for enhanced communication between practitioners, policy makers, and researchers. Finally, we briefly touch on the need to discuss the relation between single intervention programs, the mental health system, and changes of contextual conditions at the macro level. © Society for Prevention Research 2018.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040934785&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs11121-018-0869-6&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=735b875ed6ddd5590430a79f60ed3a3c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rose, N.</author><author>Andraud, M.</author><author>Bigault, L.</author><author>Jestin, A.</author><author>Grasland, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A commercial PCV2a-based vaccine significantly reduces PCV2b transmission in experimental conditions</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title></periodical><pages>3738-3745</pages><volume>34</volume><number>33</number><issue>33</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.06.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Transmission characteristics of PCV2 have been compared between vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs in experimental conditions. Twenty-four Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) piglets, vaccinated against PCV2 at 3 weeks of age (PCV2a recombinant CAP protein-based vaccine), were inoculated at 15 days post-vaccination with a PCV2b inoculum (6 ⋅ 105 TCID50), and put in contact with 24 vaccinated SPF piglets during 42 days post-inoculation. Those piglets were shared in six replicates of a contact trial involving 4 inoculated piglets mingled with 4 susceptible SPF piglets. Two replicates of a similar contact trial were made with non-vaccinated pigs. Non vaccinated animals received a placebo at vaccination time and were inoculated the same way and at the same time as the vaccinated group. All the animals were monitored twice weekly using quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA for serology until 42 days post-inoculation. The frequency of infection and the PCV2 genome load in sera of the vaccinated pigs were significantly reduced compared to the non-vaccinated animals. The duration of infectiousness was significantly different between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups (16.6 days [14.7;18.4] and 26.6 days [22.9;30.4] respectively). The transmission rate was also considerably decreased in vaccinated pigs (β = 0.09 [0.05–0.14] compared to β = 0.19 [0.11–0.32] in non-vaccinated pigs). This led to an estimated reproduction ratio of 1.5 [95% CI 0.8 – 2.2] in vaccinated animals versus 5.1 [95% CI 2.5 – 8.2] in non-vaccinated pigs when merging data of this experiment with previous trials carried out in same conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84990946937&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.vaccine.2016.06.005&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=200f3cae3d4b754d2edfd4c004e6ceae</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cobos, P.L.</author><author>Gutiérrez-Cobo, M.J.</author><author>Morís, J.</author><author>Luque, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dependent measure and time constraints modulate the competition between conflicting feature-based and rule-based generalization processes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory and Cognition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory and Cognition</full-title></periodical><pages>515-527</pages><volume>43</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1037/xlm0000335</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In our study, we tested the hypothesis that feature-based and rule-based generalization involve different types of processes that may affect each other producing different results depending on time constraints and on how generalization is measured. For this purpose, participants in our experiments learned cue-outcome relationships that followed the opposites rule: Single cues that signaled the same outcome (e.g., A-1/B-1) predicted the opposite outcome when presented in compound (e.g., AB-2). Some cues were only presented in compound during training (e.g., EF-1) to see if at test participants tended to generalize according to rule-based (i.e., E-2/F-2) or according to feature-based generalization (i.e., E-1/F-1). The generalization test used 2 different tasks: a predictive judgment task, and a cued-response priming task. In Experiment 1, participants' verbal ratings were consistent with rule-based generalization. However, participants' reaction times (RTs) in the cued-response priming task were consistent with feature-based generalization. Experiment 2 replicated the results from Experiment 1, and it also provided evidence consistent with feature-based or rule-based generalization depending on whether a short stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA; 200 ms) or a long SOA (1300 ms), respectively, was used in the priming task. Our results are interpreted as supporting the idea that feature-based generalization process relies on fast, associative processes, whereas rule-based generalization is slow and depends on executive control resources. The latter generalization process would inhibit the former when enough time and resources are available. Otherwise, feature-based generalization would take control of responses. © 2016 American Psychological Association.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995529409&amp;doi=10.1037%2fxlm0000335&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=447b5e9e4ce449b06911252478126f2c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuramatsu, J.B.</author><author>Gerner, S.T.</author><author>Schellinger, P.D.</author><author>Glahn, J.</author><author>Endres, M.</author><author>Sobesky, J.</author><author>Flechsenhar, J.</author><author>Neugebauer, H.</author><author>Jüttler, E.</author><author>Grau, A.</author><author>Palm, F.</author><author>Röther, J.</author><author>Michels, P.</author><author>Hamann, G.F.</author><author>Hüwel, J.</author><author>Hagemann, G.</author><author>Barber, B.</author><author>Terborg, C.</author><author>Trostdorf, F.</author><author>Bäzner, H.</author><author>Roth, A.</author><author>Wöhrle, J.</author><author>Keller, M.</author><author>Schwarz, M.</author><author>Reimann, G.</author><author>Volkmann, J.</author><author>Müllges, W.</author><author>Kraft, P.</author><author>Classen, J.</author><author>Hobohm, C.</author><author>Horn, M.</author><author>Milewski, A.</author><author>Reichmann, H.</author><author>Schneider, H.</author><author>Schimmel, E.</author><author>Fink, G.R.</author><author>Dohmen, C.</author><author>Stetefeld, H.</author><author>Witte, O.</author><author>Günther, A.</author><author>Neumann-Haefelin, T.</author><author>Racs, A.E.</author><author>Nueckel, M.</author><author>Erbguth, F.</author><author>Kloska, S.P.</author><author>Dörfler, A.</author><author>Köhrmann, M.</author><author>Schwab, S.</author><author>Huttner, H.B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Anticoagulant reversal, blood pressure levels, and anticoagulant resumption in patients with anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage</title><secondary-title>JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>824-836</pages><volume>313</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jama.2015.0846</electronic-resource-num><abstract>IMPORTANCE: Although use of oral anticoagulants (OACs) is increasing, there is a substantial lack of data on how to treat OAC-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of anticoagulation reversal and blood pressure (BP) with hematoma enlargement and the effects of OAC resumption. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study at 19 German tertiary care centers (2006-2012) including 1176 individuals for analysis of long-term functional outcome, 853 for analysis of hematoma enlargement, and 719 for analysis of OAC resumption. EXPOSURES: Reversal of anticoagulation during acute phase, systolic BP at 4 hours, and reinitiation of OAC for long-term treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency of hematoma enlargement in relation to international normalized ratio (INR) and BP. Incidence analysis of ischemic and hemorrhagic events with or without OAC resumption. Factors associated with favorable (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3) vs unfavorable functional outcome. RESULTS: Hemorrhage enlargement occurred in 307 of 853 patients (36.0%). Reduced rates of hematoma enlargement were associated with reversal of INR levels &lt;1.3 within 4 hours after admission (43/217 [19.8%]) vs INR of ≥1.3 (264/636 [41.5%]; P &lt; .001) and systolic BP &lt;160 mm Hg at 4 hours (167/504 [33.1%]) vs ≥160 mm Hg (98/187 [52.4%]; P &lt; .001). The combination of INR reversal &lt;1.3 within 4 hours and systolic BP of &lt;160 mm Hg at 4 hours was associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement (35/193 [18.1%] vs 220/498 [44.2%] not achieving these values; OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19-0.42; P &lt; .001) and lower rates of in-hospital mortality (26/193 [13.5%] vs 103/498 [20.7%]; OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37-0.95; P = .03). OAC was resumed in 172 of 719 survivors (23.9%). OAC resumption showed fewer ischemic complications (OAC: 9/172 [5.2%] vs no OAC: 82/547 [15.0%]; P &lt; .001) and not significantly different hemorrhagic complications (OAC: 14/172 [8.1%] vs no OAC: 36/547 [6.6%]; P = .48). Propensity-matched survival analysis in patients with atrial fibrillation who restarted OAC showed a decreased HR of 0.258 (95% CI, 0.125-0.534; P &lt; .001) for long-term mortality. Functional long-term outcome was unfavorable in 786 of 1083 patients (72.6%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with OAC-associated ICH, reversal of INR &lt;1.3 within 4 hours and systolic BP &lt;160 mm Hg at 4 hours were associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement, and resumption of OAC therapy was associated with lower risk of ischemic events.

Replication studies are critical for building a cumulative body of research knowledge. This article discusses and provides a typology of different types of replications, compares replications with other approaches to cumulating knowledge, and provides guidelines toward producing high-quality replication studies. The articles in this Special Issue provide examples of replication studies in strategic management. Managerial summary: Research studies sometimes draw implications for managerial practice. A single empirical study, however, is specific to a particular context, relies on a particular set of data, and uses a particular research design. As a consequence, a single study cannot establish whether the findings generalize to a different context and whether the research design is robust to alternative approaches. Replication studies can help to establish the range of applicability of prior studies and better support what implications can be drawn for managerial practice.

We conducted a review of replication rates in special education journals similar to the review conducted by Makel et al. in this issue. Unknowingly conducting independent reviews allowed for an unexpected opportunity to examine how two teams of researchers attempted to replicate a previously published study and explore similarities and differences between the outcomes. In our review, we identified 70 replication studies published between 1997 and 2013, indicating that 0.41% of published articles in special education journals are replication studies. Similar to findings reported by Makel et al., our review indicates that most replications are successful and that successful replications are more likely when author overlap occurs. Although there are similar patterns in the two data sets, an examination of exact agreement on article inclusion revealed an agreement rate of 15.2%.

Materials and Methods: Data on 355 Jersey crossbred cattle maintained at the Post-graduate Research Institute in Animal Sciences, Kattupakkam, Tamil Nadu, distributed over 30 years (1985 to 2014). The effect of various non-genetic factors including the period of birth, season of birth, period of calving, season of calving and parity were analyzed through leastsquares analyses using univariate general linear model. The different (co)variance components for calculation of genetic parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood method by fitting an animal model. Results: The overall least-squares means (±standard error) of age at first service, age at first calving, weight at first calving, service period, calving interval, dry period, and number of services per conception were 848.06±9.72 days, 1204±12.20 days, 289.81±1.71 kg, 210.01±6.41 days, 489.12±6.45 days, 137.96±5.58 days, 2.50±0.07, respectively. Period of calving had either significant (p &lt; 0.05) or highly significant (p &lt; 0.01) effect on all reproduction traits studied except service period, calving interval, and dry period. Number of services per conception was affected by season of calving. Parity had significant influence (p &lt; 0.05) or highly significant (p &lt; 0.01) influence on all the traits studied except service period and dry period. Heritability estimates of age at first service, age at first calving, weight at first calving, service period, calving interval, dry period, and number of services per conception were 0.299, 0.220, 0.017, 0.142, 0.222, 0.177, and 0.042, respectively. The estimates of repeatability for service period, calving interval, dry period, and number of services per conception were 0.219, 0.234, 0.420, and 0.001, respectively. Conclusions: The reproduction performances of Jersey × Red Sindhi crossbreds were lower when compared to the earlier reports on Jersey crossbreds. Heritability and repeatability values were also low to moderate, indicating limited scope for improvement through selection.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006137632&amp;doi=10.14202%2fvetworld.2016.1012-1017&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7a3c527d2880baa9f0b52f2f43f5496a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mu, D.</author><author>Cuevas, A.</author><author>Yang, L.</author><author>Hu, H.</author><author>Xing, X.</author><author>Mao, B.</author><author>Wang, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Understanding the reproducibility of crowd-reported security vulnerabilities</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 27th USENIX Security Symposium</secondary-title></titles><pages>919-936</pages><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Today's software systems are increasingly relying on the "power of the crowd" to identify new security vulnerabilities. And yet, it is not well understood how reproducible the crowd-reported vulnerabilities are. In this paper, we perform the first empirical analysis on a wide range of real-world security vulnerabilities (368 in total) with the goal of quantifying their reproducibility. Following a carefully controlled workflow, we organize a focused group of security analysts to carry out reproduction experiments. With 3600 man-hours spent, we obtain quantitative evidence on the prevalence of missing information in vulnerability reports and the low repro-ducibility of the vulnerabilities. We find that relying on a single vulnerability report from a popular security forum is generally difficult to succeed due to the incomplete information. By widely crowdsourcing the information gathering, security analysts could increase the reproduction success rate, but still face key challenges to troubleshoot the non-reproducible cases. To further explore solutions, we surveyed hackers, researchers, and engineers who have extensive domain expertise in software security (N=43). Going beyond Internet-scale crowd-sourcing, we find that, security professionals heavily rely on manual debugging and speculative guessing to infer the missed information. Our result suggests that there is not only a necessity to overhaul the way a security forum collects vulnerability reports, but also a need for automated mechanisms to collect information commonly missing in a report. © 2018 Proceedings of the 27th USENIX Security Symposium.

ORF1 is predicted to encode a replication-associated protein (Rep) essential for replication of viral DNA. In some studies, PCV1 replicated more efficiently in PK-15 cells than PCV2 was elucidated. PCV1 compared with PCV2; there is some amino acids' deficiency on Rep protein. To identify whether the above amino acids deletion affects the replication of PCV1 and PCV2, we constructed three double copy clones by overlap extension PCR. The 2PCV2(vV) clone deleted the valine of Rep protein in the backbone of PCV2 genome. The 2PCV2(dSGR) clone inserted serine, glycine and arginine of Rep protein successively in the backbone of PCV2 genome. The 2PCV2(dSGR&amp;vV) clone inserted serine, glycine and arginine as well as deleted the valine of Rep protein in the backbone of PCV2 genome. These clones we constructed with amino acid mutations and parental DNA clones were all transfected in PK-15 cells that free of PCV contamination, and their growth characteristics in vitro were determined and compared, to evaluating the replication of the mutant infectious DNA clones. Our results showed that the double copy infectious clones with amino acid mutations could be rescued in vitro. The 2PCV2(vV) replicated more efficiently than parental viruses 2PCV2 and 2PCV1 but the replicated ability of 2PCV2(dSGR) and 2PCV2(dSGR&amp;vV) is attenuated than parental viruses 2PCV2 and 2PCV1. We can determine the valine is the important amino acid that cause PCV1 replicated more efficiently in PK-15 cells than PCV2 primarily. These findings are benefit for exploring the mechanisms of viral replication in pigs and important implications for PCV2 vaccine development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042944170&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.micpath.2018.02.045&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2ef58a41c61ba49ca83c65049e3eac08</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aichner, T.</author><author>Coletti, P.</author><author>Forza, C.</author><author>Perkmann, U.</author><author>Trentin, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of Subcultural Differences on Country and Product Evaluations: A Replication Study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Global Marketing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Global Marketing</full-title></periodical><pages>115-127</pages><volume>29</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/08911762.2015.1138012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article validates the results of a study by Laroche, Papadopoulos, Heslop, and Bergeron (2003).

However, one of the restrictions the use this variable is associated the adoption of the estimation technique, since there are different forms of calculation. Thus, the objective was to compare the cover fractional of soil cultivated with Urochloa ruziziensis and Urochloa spp., using three measurement techniques: visual evaluation, evaluation by intercept or transect and evaluation by photographic image. For this, six experiments were conducted in the field, in randomized block design. The experiment 1, 2 and 3 was formed by the species of Urochloa ruziziensis and composed of three treatments, represented by the three measuring techniques (visual evaluation, evaluation by transect and evaluation by photographic image), with eight replications. The experiment 4, 5 and 6 had factorial arrangement 2 x 3, the factor A was formed of two species of Urochloa (Urochloa ruziziensis and Urochloa spp. cv. Mulato II) and the factor B by the three measuring techniques (visual evaluation, evaluation by transect and evaluation by photographic image), with four replications. The measures of fractional of cover soil were made at 30, 60 and 90 days after sowing. Was found that the greater the uniformity of soil cover by forage plants, closest are the values of fractional of vegetation cover obtained by the three estimation techniques. The measurement techniques of visual and to transect of the fraction of soil cover were considered similar, and the efficiency of the evaluation by photographic image depend on the individual calibration of each image. © 2015 Sociedade Brasileira da Ciencia das Plantas Daninha.

METHODS: Seventeen healthy male subjects who did not regularly compete in overhand sports and had no history of glenohumeral complaints took part in the study. Force reproduction was measured in the dominant shoulder. A target force had to be reproduced in three consecutive trials before and after a fatigue protocol. Maximal voluntary contraction was assessed to determine the target force. Measured data before and after fatigue were analyzed as well as error scores to examine the effect of fatigue. RESULTS: Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a significant influence only in the testing direction. No difference was found with the target value before or after the fatiguing repetitions. The inter-trial intra-class correlation coefficient showed high reliability.

Two polypropylenes with different melt flow rates (MFR) were used throughout this study. The used removable mold insert was textured with a femtosecond laser. Replication of these periodic structures, called ripples, is thus investigated. Despite different MFR, we show that the viscosities of the two polymers at the investigated temperatures and injection shear rates are similar. The reproducibility of the injected molded samples and the texture of the mold were analyzed. We propose a specific methodology to quantify the reproducibility quality replicas. The latter introduces morphological parameters such as anisotropy rate, power density, etc. A difference between the two replicas was noticeable. Based on rheological analysis, the viscosity was ruled out as the origin of this difference. Other properties were identified as the source such as the chain length and the stress relaxation time. Their impact on the replication quality was investigated and found interesting. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946096148&amp;doi=10.1088%2f0960-1317%2f25%2f11%2f115027&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=418863fd12d6b272a68972cdfd4ed5b6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biava, M.</author><author>Caglioti, C.</author><author>Castilletti, C.</author><author>Bordi, L.</author><author>Carletti, F.</author><author>Colavita, F.</author><author>Quartu, S.</author><author>Nicastri, E.</author><author>Iannetta, M.</author><author>Vairo, F.</author><author>Liuzzi, G.</author><author>Taglietti, F.</author><author>Ippolito, G.</author><author>Capobianchi, M.R.</author><author>Lalle, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Persistence of ZIKV-RNA in the cellular fraction of semen is accompanied by a surrogate-marker of viral replication.

Recent studies highlighted a preferential association of ZIKV with the cellular fraction (CF) of different specimen types. Our aim was to evaluate the presence of ZIKV-RNA in different body fluids, focusing on semen specimens to assess the ZIKV-RNA content in either the unfractionated sample, its CF or seminal plasma (SP). In addition, to establish if the presence of ZIKV genome was associated with active virus replication, we measured the levels of negative-strand ZIKV-RNA. ZIKV total-RNA was detected in blood, urine and unfractionated semen, and neg-RNA in semen CF and SP samples longitudinally collected from two ZIKV-positive men followed at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "L. Spallanzani", Italy. In both patients, ZIKV total-RNA was detected in CF with ct values always lower than in the corresponding unfractionated samples, and was observed even in the CF from negative unfractionated semen samples. In Patient 2, neg-RNA was also detected in CF, suggesting ongoing viral replication. Our results demonstrate higher clinical sensitivity of CF as compared to whole semen testing, emphasizing the need to extend ZIKV-RNA testing to CF, to rule out virus presence and the possible risk of sexual transmission. © 2018 by EDIMES - Edizioni Internazionali Srl.

The authors of the review, however, noted considerable differences across the rubrics when addressing the generalization of findings. One critical finding is that the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) review process does not capture details needed for report readers to evaluate generalization. This conclusion is reasonable if considering only the WWC’s SCD design standards. It is important to note that these standards are not used in isolation, and thus generalization details cannot be fully understood without also considering the review protocols and a tool called the WWC SCD review guide. Our purpose in this commentary is to clarify how the WWC review procedures gather information on generalization criteria and to describe a threshold for judging how much evidence is available. It is important to clarify how the system works so that the SCD research community understands the standards, which in turn might facilitate use of future WWC reports and possibly influence both the conduct and the reporting of SCD studies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947493818&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10864-015-9224-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f87834ce78e1e53d70849dd1408a3c1a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vuistiner, P.</author><author>Rousson, V.</author><author>Henry, H.</author><author>Lescuyer, P.</author><author>Boulat, O.</author><author>Gaspoz, J.-M.</author><author>Mooser, V.</author><author>Vollenweider, P.</author><author>Waeber, G.</author><author>Cornuz, J.</author><author>Paccaud, F.</author><author>Bochud, M.</author><author>Guessous, I.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A population-based model to consider the effect of seasonal variation on serum 25(OH)D and Vitamin D status</title><secondary-title>BioMed Research International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioMed Research International</full-title></periodical><volume>2015</volume><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2015/168189</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background. We elaborated a model that predicts the centiles of the 25(OH)D distribution taking into account seasonal variation. Methods. Data from two Swiss population-based studies were used to generate (CoLaus) and validate (Bus Santé) the model. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by ultra high pressure LC-MS/MS and immunoassay. Linear regression models on square-root transformed 25(OH)D values were used to predict centiles of the 25(OH)D distribution. Distribution functions of the observations from the replication set predicted with the model were inspected to assess replication. Results. Overall, 4,912 and 2,537 Caucasians were included in original and replication sets, respectively. Mean (SD) 25(OH)D, age, BMI, and % of men were 47.5 (22.1) nmol/L, 49.8 (8.5) years, 25.6 (4.1) kg/m2, and 49.3% in the original study. The best model included gender, BMI, and sin-cos functions of measurement day. Sex- and BMI-specific 25(OH)D centile curves as a function of measurement date were generated. The model estimates any centile of the 25(OH)D distribution for given values of sex, BMI, and date and the quantile corresponding to a 25(OH)D measurement. Conclusions. We generated and validated centile curves of 25(OH)D in the general adult Caucasian population. These curves can help rank vitamin D centile independently of when 25(OH)D is measured. © 2015 Philippe Vuistiner et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941623016&amp;doi=10.1155%2f2015%2f168189&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e97cc91033a51350551821e90c1b5356</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ragkhitwetsagul, C.</author><author>Paixao, M.</author><author>Adham, M.</author><author>Busari, S.</author><author>Krinke, J.</author><author>Drake, J.H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Searching for configurations in clone evaluation - A replication study</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</secondary-title></titles><pages>250-256</pages><volume>9962 LNCS</volume><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-319-47106-8_20</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Clone detection is the process of finding duplicated code within a software code base in an automated manner.

We apply the framework to 14 releases of Mockito, a Java mocking framework. We observe that the optimised parameters outperform the tools’ default parameters in term of clone agreement by 19.91% to 66.43 %. However, the framework gives undesirable results in term of clone quality. EvaClone either maximises or minimises a number of clones in order to achieve the highest agreement resulting in more false positives or false negatives introduced consequently. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989868679&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-47106-8_20&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3137109e142ed8ce480c36ead2444e72</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Waller, L.</author><author>Walter, H.</author><author>Kruschwitz, J.D.</author><author>Reuter, L.</author><author>Müller, S.</author><author>Erk, S.</author><author>Veer, I.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the replicability, specificity, and generalizability of connectome fingerprints</title><secondary-title>NeuroImage</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NeuroImage</full-title></periodical><pages>371-377</pages><volume>158</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.07.016</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Establishing reliable, robust, and unique brain signatures from neuroimaging data is a prerequisite for precision psychiatry, and therefore a highly sought-after goal in contemporary neuroscience. Recently, the procedure of connectome fingerprinting, using brain functional connectivity profiles as such signatures, was shown to be able to accurately identify individuals from a group of 126 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). However, the specificity and generalizability of this procedure were not tested. In this replication study, we show both for the original and an extended HCP data set (n = 900 subjects), as well as for an additional data set of more commonly acquired imaging quality (n = 84) that (i) although the high accuracy can be replicated for the larger HCP 900 data set, accuracy is (ii) lower for standard neuroimaging data, and, that (iii) connectome fingerprinting may not be specific enough to distinguish between individuals. In addition, both accuracy and specificity are projected to drop considerably as the size of a data set increases. Although the moderate-to-high accuracies do suggest there is a portion of unique variance, our results suggest that connectomes may actually be quite similar across individuals. This outcome may be relevant to how precision psychiatry could benefit from inferences based on functional connectomes. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85024373556&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.neuroimage.2017.07.016&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=77770181c4a969dc8bc6298d76f1560c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rajini, A.</author><author>Revathy, K.</author><author>Chitrikha, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Toxicity and reproductive effect of combination pesticide to daphnia magna</title><secondary-title>Indian Journal of Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Indian Journal of Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-5</pages><volume>9</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.17485/ijst/2016/v9i3/76609</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Daphnia magna is ubiquitous link in ecological food chain; they are small planktonic crustacean used in ecotoxicological acute tests and chronic reproduction studies. Daphnia species are very sensitive to xenobiotics and very low concentrations will affect their survival. The objective is to investigate the toxicity and reproductive effect of Daphnia magna exposed to different concentrations of combination pesticide in M4 medium in accordance to OECD 211 guideline and in exposure water. To maintain the water hardness within the range in the exposure water as per the OECD guideline reverse osmosis water and drinking well water was blended 1:1 ratio. Twenty one days semi-static exposure was conducted with 10 daphnia held individually in each treatment and control. Daphnids were exposed to 0.0000134, 0.000134, 0.00134, 0.0134, 0.134, 1.34 and 13.4 μg/L of Chlorpyrifos 50% + Cypermethrin 5% EC. 10 μL of alga and yeast were fed with for daphnia of water and only alga was provided M4 medium during the semi-static 48 hour medium change. Agilent QQQ GC-MS/MS, Electron Impact Ionization mode was used for active content analysis. Stock solution of 13.4 μg/L was analyzed for its active content chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. At 0 hour it was 89.7%, 87.5% and at 48 hour it was 85.3%, 72.4%, respectively. 0.0000134 μg/L was below limit of quantification level. Statistical analysis was performed with ECOSTATS program version 2012.06.03 (SAS Version 9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA, 2002-2010). EC50 calculated was 0.012 μg/L for M4 medium and 0.003 μg/L for exposure water at the end of 21 days. Parental mortality of daphnia and reproduction rate decline of off-springs collected in M4 medium and exposure water was found to be dose dependent. Significant change (P &lt; 0.05) in off-spring reproduction was observed in M4 medium and exposure water by ANOVA Student-Newman-Keuls test. Based on the EC50 it is concluded that the pesticide is toxic to daphnids exposed in water than M4 medium exposure. Pesticide mixture effects and its interactions within mixtures is an area of concern to public and regulatory authorities, hence the combined actions of pesticides need to be addressed in the risk assessment process since mixtures of these chemicals may cause higher toxicity effects than those expected from the single compounds. Endocrine disrupting chemicals are compounds that alter the normal functioning of the endocrine system of both wildlife and humans and the tested pesticide active ingredient is considered as endocrine disruptor no reliable data is available on the reproduction effect of the combination pesticide and this experiment throws light that exposure water can also be used to assess contamination of pesticide like M4 medium which is used regularly in ecotoxicological studies for pesticide toxicity assessment.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958175799&amp;doi=10.17485%2fijst%2f2016%2fv9i3%2f76609&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d99c8e6c8a533b3f5aa471ed184e08f3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Esbensen, K.H.</author><author>Wagner, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sampling quality assessment: The replication experiment</title><secondary-title>Spectroscopy Europe</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Spectroscopy Europe</full-title></periodical><pages>20-25</pages><volume>28</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Kim H.

Pusa Swami in green house. Five Pi levels (250, 500, 750 and 1000 eggs) were used during experiment. Nematode reproduction was assessed by determining the number of galls, egg-masses,eggs per root system, and reproduction rateper root system. Egg-masses on Phloxine B stained roots were quantified by using stereomicroscopeand root systems were rated for galling and egg mass presence on a 0 to 5 scale where 0 = no gall or egg masses, 1 = 1-2, 2 = 3-10, 3 = 11-30, 4 = 31-100, and 5 = &gt;100 galls or egg masses per root system. Nematode reproduction was directly proportional to initial population density (Pi). Reproduction rate (Pf/Pi, where Pf = final number of eggs/initial egg density) increased proportionately with increased Pi. Foliage growth (cm) had inverse relation to Pi whereas root growth (g), gall and egg-mass indices were significantly increased. Our results show that root weight is poor parameter to assess the effects of root knot nematode to correlate with foliage growth. © 2016, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.

We sought to examine how variations in structural and functional brain networks relate to depressive symptoms in premanifest HD and healthy controls. Brain networks were constructed using diffusion tractography (70 preHD and 81 controls) and resting state fMRI (92 preHD and 94 controls) data. A sub-network associated with depression was identified in a data-driven fashion and network-based statistics was used to investigate which specific connections correlated with depression scores. A replication analysis was then performed using data from a separate study. Correlations between depressive symptoms with increased functional connectivity and decreased structural connectivity were seen for connections in the default mode network (DMN) and basal ganglia in preHD. This study reveals specific connections in the DMN and basal ganglia that are associated with depressive symptoms in preHD.

A recent genomewide analysis of Trypanosoma brucei, the etiological agent of sleeping sickness, localized its replication origins to the boundaries ofmultigenic transcription units. To better understand genomic replication in this organism, we examined replication by single molecule analysis of replicated DNA. We determined the average speed of replication forks of procyclic and bloodstream form cells and we found that T. brucei DNA replication rate is similar to rates seen in other eukaryotes. We also analyzed the replication dynamics of a central region of chromosome 1 in procyclic forms. We present evidence for replication terminating within the central part of the chromosome and thus emanating from both sides, suggesting a previously unmapped origin toward the 5' extremity of chromosome 1. Also, termination is not at a fixed location in chromosome 1, but is rather variable. Importantly, we found a replication origin located near an ORC1/CDC6 binding site that is detected after replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea treatment, suggesting it may be a dormant origin activated in response to replicative stress. Collectively, our findings support the existence of more replication origins in T. brucei than previously appreciated. © The Author(s) 2015.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937604501&amp;doi=10.1093%2fnar%2fgku1389&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3f433fd7ade129e633f1b7805384f5a9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jabin, P.-E.</author><author>Miroshnikov, A.</author><author>Young, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cellulose biodegradation models; An example of cooperative interactions in structured populations</title><secondary-title>ESAIM: Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ESAIM: Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis</full-title></periodical><pages>2289-2318</pages><volume>51</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1051/m2an/2017021</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We introduce various models for cellulose bio-degradation by micro-organisms. Those models rely on complex chemical mechanisms, involve the structure of the cellulose chains and are allowed to depend on the phenotypical traits of the population of micro-organisms. We then use the corresponding models in the context of multiple-trait populations. This leads to classical, logistic type, reproduction rates limiting the growth of large populations but also, and more surprisingly, limiting the growth of populations which are too small in a manner similar to the effects seen in populations requiring cooperative interactions (or sexual reproduction). This study thus offers a striking example of how some mechanisms resembling cooperation can occur in structured biological populations, even in the absence of any actual cooperation. © EDP Sciences, SMAI 2017.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038434214&amp;doi=10.1051%2fm2an%2f2017021&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9b29875eb4f5022790c4a91b38434234</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Perfito, N.</author><author>Tsui, R.</author><author>Iorns, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Practicalities of conducting replication studies</title><secondary-title>Drug Discovery World</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Drug Discovery World</full-title></periodical><pages>60-63</pages><volume>18</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The first results for the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology offer insights into the time and cost of conducting replication studies in preclinical cancer biology.While many agree that developing a therapeutic should not be pursued unless grounded in reproducible preclinical results, the costs of replication have, to date, not been considered when such studies are funded.With this first estimate of the resources required, the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology lays the foundation for developing a research funding structure that may provide appropriate incentives for completing replication studies.

This is facilitated by recording velocity time signals of the original simulation and computing time traces of vortex particles to be seeded into the secondary simulation near its upstream domain boundary. The proposed Flow Reproduction Method (FRM) thus allows us to re-create the flow field, without the need to simulate the underlying physics responsible for the flow features. A natural field of application is the re-creation of wakes from flows past bluff bodies of arbitrarily complex geometry, the resolution of which is computationally expensive. The recording is performed on a sampling system of the velocity field. Reproduction of the sampled simulation is then performed by inserting vortex particles in defined positions and time intervals into the secondary simulation. This proceeds in a smaller domain with the advantage of significantly reduced computational cost. In the simulations presented here, wake flows of upstream cylinders are reproduced. Convergence studies are performed to validate the FRM. The quality of flow reproduction is assessed and quantified. The computational efficiency of the reproduction simulation is enhanced additionally by using different adaptive numerical techniques. The method is then applied to fluid-structure interaction simulations of a wake buffeting problem. Good agreement is found between the dynamic response quantities when comparing original simulations and those with reproduced flows, whereby the latter are performed up to five times faster. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959018873&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jweia.2016.02.003&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e3a3a0d2a7506c557d2c643987378309</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Drifke, M.A.</author><author>Tiger, J.H.</author><author>Wierzba, B.C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using behavioral skills training to teach parents to implement three-step prompting: A component analysis and generalization assessment</title><secondary-title>Learning and Motivation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Learning and Motivation</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>57</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.lmot.2016.12.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Noncompliance is a common childhood behavior problem that has been treated effectively using three-step prompting and differential reinforcement of compliance. Researchers have successfully taught parents to implement this intervention package using behavioral skills training (BST). Although effective, BST is an intensive teaching strategy and the generality of the effects of training on parent and child behavior have not been assessed. The current study conducted a component analysis of the elements of BST (written instructions, modeling, and rehearsal with performance feedback) to determine the sufficient and necessary elements of training needed to teach parents to implement three-step prompting and DRA. Further, we assessed generalization of parents’ skills across multiple instructional contexts with their children. The results indicated that the full BST package was necessary for parents to reach mastery levels of correct implementation, but training generalized across untargeted tasks. © 2016</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007028712&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.lmot.2016.12.001&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d5bf611231c63305fbab917ecce9c946</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tao, Y.</author><author>Yuan, P.</author><author>Song, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Error analysis of regularized least-square regression with Fredholm kernel</title><secondary-title>Neurocomputing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neurocomputing</full-title></periodical><pages>237-244</pages><volume>249</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.neucom.2017.03.076</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Learning with Fredholm kernel has attracted increasing attention recently since it can effectively utilize the data information to improve the prediction performance.

The JCPyV genome is composed of an early region and a late region, which are physically separated by the non-coding control region (NCCR). The DNA sequence of the NCCR distinguishes two forms of JCPyV, the designated archetype and the prototype, which resulted from a rearrangement of the archetype sequence. To date, the cell culture systems for propagating JCPyV archetype have been very limited in their availability and robustness. Prior to this study, it was demonstrated that JCPyV archetype DNA replicates in COS-7 simian kidney cells expressing SV40 TAg and COS-7 cells expressing HIV-1 Tat. Based on these observations, the present study was conducted to reproduce an in vitro model in COS-7 cells transfected with the JCPyV archetype strain in order to study JCPyV DNA replication and analyze NCCR rearrangements during the viral life cycle. The efficiency of JCPyV replication was evaluated by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) and by hemagglutination (HA) assay after transfection. In parallel, sequence analysis of JCPyV NCCR was performed. JCPyV efficiently replicated in kidney-derived COS-7 cells, as demonstrated by a progressive increase in viral load and virion particle production after transfection. The archetypal structure of NCCR was maintained during the viral cycle, but two characteristic point mutations were detected 28 days after transfection. This model is a useful tool for analyzing NCCR rearrangements during in vitro replication in cells that are sites of viral persistence, such as tubular epithelial cells of the kidney. © 2017, The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028977905&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00705-017-3542-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d5813121aaf9feab15db35353e59a239</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martino, D.J.</author><author>Ashley, S.</author><author>Koplin, J.</author><author>Ellis, J.</author><author>Saffery, R.</author><author>Dharmage, S.C.</author><author>Gurrin, L.</author><author>Matheson, M.C.</author><author>Kalb, B.</author><author>Marenholz, I.</author><author>Beyer, K.</author><author>Lee, Y.-A.</author><author>Hong, X.</author><author>Wang, X.</author><author>Vukcevic, D.</author><author>Motyer, A.</author><author>Leslie, S.</author><author>Allen, K.J.</author><author>Ferreira, M.A.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomewide association study of peanut allergy reproduces association with amino acid polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1</title><secondary-title>Clinical and Experimental Allergy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical and Experimental Allergy</full-title></periodical><pages>217-223</pages><volume>47</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/cea.12863</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Genetic variants for IgE-mediated peanut allergy are yet to be fully characterized and to date only one genomewide association study (GWAS) has been published. Objective: To identify genetic variants associated with challenge-proven peanut allergy. Methods: We carried out a GWAS comparing 73 infants with challenge-proven IgE-mediated peanut allergy against 148 non-allergic infants (all ~ 1 year old). We tested a total of 3.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as imputed HLA alleles and amino acids. Replication was assessed by de novo genotyping in a panel of additional 117 cases and 380 controls, and in silico testing in two independent GWAS cohorts. Results: We identified 21 independent associations at P ≤ 5 × 10−5 but were unable to replicate these. The most significant HLA association was the previously reported amino acid variant located at position 71, within the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRB1 (P = 2 × 10−4). Our study therefore reproduced previous findings for the association between peanut allergy and HLA-DRB1 in this Australian population. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Genetic determinants for challenge-proven peanut allergy include alleles at the HLA-DRB1 locus. © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009508353&amp;doi=10.1111%2fcea.12863&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9a4c1c8b2d49c1814b4f1f1f6d9b0def</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zeng, X.</author><author>Vonk, J.M.</author><author>de Jong, K.</author><author>Xu, X.</author><author>Huo, X.</author><author>Boezen, H.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>No convincing association between genetic markers and respiratory symptoms: Results of a GWA study</title><secondary-title>Respiratory Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Respiratory Research</full-title></periodical><volume>18</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12931-016-0495-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Respiratory symptoms are associated with accelerated lung function decline, and increased hospitalization and mortality rates in the general population. Although several environmental risk factors for respiratory symptoms are known, knowledge on genetic risk factors is lacking. We aim to identify genetic variants associated with respiratory symptoms by genome-wide association (GWA) analyses. Methods: We conducted the first GWA study on cough, dyspnea and phlegm among 7,976 participants in the LifeLines I cohort and used the LifeLines II cohort (n = 5,260) and the Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen cohort (n = 1,529) for replication. Results: We identified 50 SNPs that were assessed for replication. Rs16918212, located in the alpha-2-macroglobulin pseudogene 1 (A2MP1), was associated with cough in both the identification (odds ratio (OR) = 0.72, p = 5.41 × 10-5) and the meta-analyzed replication cohorts (OR = 0.83, p = 0.033). No other significant replicated associations were found. Conclusions: Given that only 1 out of 50 SNPs showed significant replication (i.e. 2%) we conclude that we did not find a convincing association between genetic markers and respiratory symptoms. Since, environmental exposures are important risk factors for respiratory symptoms, the next step is to perform a genome-wide interaction (GWI) study to identify genetic susceptibility loci for respiratory symptoms in interaction with known harmful environmental exposures. © 2017 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008625444&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12931-016-0495-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dc3bc316d965c6ce5110f5f3ff2cfa3e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olorisade, B.K.</author><author>Brereton, P.</author><author>Andras, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility of studies on text mining for citation screening in systematic reviews: Evaluation and checklist</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biomedical Informatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biomedical Informatics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>73</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jbi.2017.07.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Context Independent validation of published scientific results through study replication is a pre-condition for accepting the validity of such results. In computation research, full replication is often unrealistic for independent results validation, therefore, study reproduction has been justified as the minimum acceptable standard to evaluate the validity of scientific claims. The application of text mining techniques to citation screening in the context of systematic literature reviews is a relatively young and growing computational field with high relevance for software engineering, medical research and other fields. However, there is little work so far on reproduction studies in the field. Objective In this paper, we investigate the reproducibility of studies in this area based on information contained in published articles and we propose reporting guidelines that could improve reproducibility. Methods The study was approached in two ways. Initially we attempted to reproduce results from six studies, which were based on the same raw dataset. Then, based on this experience, we identified steps considered essential to successful reproduction of text mining experiments and characterized them to measure how reproducible is a study given the information provided on these steps. 33 articles were systematically assessed for reproducibility using this approach. Results Our work revealed that it is currently difficult if not impossible to independently reproduce the results published in any of the studies investigated. The lack of information about the datasets used limits reproducibility of about 80% of the studies assessed. Also, information about the machine learning algorithms is inadequate in about 27% of the papers. On the plus side, the third party software tools used are mostly free and available. Conclusions The reproducibility potential of most of the studies can be significantly improved if more attention is paid to information provided on the datasets used, how they were partitioned and utilized, and how any randomization was controlled. We introduce a checklist of information that needs to be provided in order to ensure that a published study can be reproduced. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025143405&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jbi.2017.07.010&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=11ac5d14a66a490160b83632a3f8b474</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Molla, W.</author><author>Frankena, K.</author><author>Gari, G.</author><author>de Jong, M.C.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Field study on the use of vaccination to control the occurrence of lumpy skin disease in Ethiopian cattle</title><secondary-title>Preventive Veterinary Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive Veterinary Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>34-41</pages><volume>147</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.08.019</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The current study was carried out in central and North-western parts of Ethiopia to assess the efficacy of Kenyan sheep pox virus strain vaccine (KS1 O-180) against natural lumpy skin disease (LSD) infection under field conditions by estimating its effect on the transmission and severity of the disease. For this study, an LSD outbreak was defined as the occurrence of at least one LSD case in a specified geographical area. An observational study was conducted on a total of 2053 (1304 vaccinated and 749 unvaccinated) cattle in 339 infected herds located in 10 sub-kebeles and a questionnaire survey was administered to 224 herd owners. Over 60% of the herd owners reported that the vaccine has a low to very low effect in protecting animals against clinical LSD; almost all of them indicated that the vaccine did not induce any adverse reactions. In the unvaccinated group of animals 31.1% were diagnosed with LSD while this was 22.5% in the vaccinated group (P &lt; 0.001). Severity of the disease was significantly reduced in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated animals (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49; 0.96). Unvaccinated infected animals were more likely (predicted fraction = 0.89) to develop moderate and severe disease than vaccinated infected animals (predicted fraction = 0.84). LSD vaccine efficacy for susceptibility was estimated to be 0.46 (i.e. a susceptibility effect of 0.54) while the infectiousness effect of the vaccine was 1.83. In other words, the vaccine reduces the susceptibility by a factor of two and increases infectiousness by approximately the same amount. LSD transmission occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated animals, the estimated reproduction ratio (R) was 1.21 in unvaccinated animals compared to 1.19 in vaccinated ones, and not significantly different. In conclusion, KS1 O-180 vaccination, as applied currently in Ethiopia, has poor efficacy in protecting cattle populations against LSD, neither by direct clinical protection nor by reducing transmission, and this signifies the urgent need to either improve the quality of the vaccine or to develop potent alternative vaccines that will confer good protection against LSD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028572308&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.prevetmed.2017.08.019&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d30da8a40938e705b310bf93e29c05fd</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rypuła, K.</author><author>Kumala, A.</author><author>Płoneczka-Janeczko, K.</author><author>Lis, P.</author><author>Karuga-Kuźniewska, E.</author><author>Dudek, K.</author><author>Całkosiński, I.</author><author>Kuźnik, P.</author><author>Chorbiński, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Occurrence of reproductive disorders in pig herds with and without Chlamydia suis infection – statistical analysis of breeding parameters</title><secondary-title>Animal Science Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal Science Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>817-824</pages><volume>89</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/asj.13000</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Chlamydiae are frequently encountered Gram-negative intracellular eubacteria that can cause clear manifestations or clinically asymptomatic disorders. C. suis and other chlamydia are primarily isolated in cases of reproductive disorders. This study was performed to estimate the impact of Chlamydia suis infection on reproduction in sows by analyzing reproduction rates and breeding parameters. The test was conducted on first generation (F1) pigs from Polish Landrace (PL) × Polish Large White (PLW). Sixty-four herds were investigated and 500 vaginal swabs were collected. Isolation of DNA was carried out directly from the swabs. All samples were analyzed for Chlamydia suis by real-time PCR with a locked nucleic acid (LNA)-containing probe. To analyze the impact of chlamydia infection on reproductive parameters, evaluation questionnaires were used. Reproductive problems were found in 77.3% of the farms tested. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that in the farms with 10 up to 120 sows, there were higher reproductive problems with chlamydia infection than in smaller and bigger pig farms. The most common problems were estrus repetition, which was reported by 57.81% of the surveyed farms, and the birth of dead piglets, which was reported by 31.25% of the investigated pig farms. Abortions, which were reported by 28.12% of the surveyed farms, were the least common reproductive disorders. © 2018 Japanese Society of Animal Science</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043581881&amp;doi=10.1111%2fasj.13000&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b23ea91d6b7c1c3559eed6e5a4454386</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson, K.A.</author><author>Wetmore, S.D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conformational Flexibility of the Benzyl-Guanine Adduct in a Bypass Polymerase Active Site Permits Replication: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title><secondary-title>Chemical Research in Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical Research in Toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>2013-2022</pages><volume>30</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/acs.chemrestox.7b00179</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases play key roles in replicating DNA that contains nucleobase addition products (adducts), there are many unknowns about their function. The present work gains indispensable structural insights from molecular dynamics simulations on the replication of O6-benzyl-guanine (Bz-dG) prior to bond formation during dCTP insertion opposite the adduct by Dpo4. When combined with previous X-ray crystal structures of the Bz-dG extension complex, molecular details are now available for each stage during a single TLS replication cycle for this carcinogenic lesion. Our calculations illustrate that Bz-dG preferentially adopts an intercalated bulky moiety orientation in the Dpo4 preinsertion complex, which stabilizes the complex through Bz-dG interactions with the previously replicated 3′-base pair and positions the carcinogenic group in the dNTP binding site. Nevertheless, the maintained inherent flexibility of Bz-dG due to a stark lack of interactions with the polymerase or template DNA allows the bulky moiety to adopt a major groove position opposite an incoming dCTP in an orientation that is conducive for the experimentally observed nonmutagenic bypass. Comparison of Bz-dG and canonical dG replication clarifies that the experimentally observed decrease in dCTP binding affinity and replication efficiency upon adduct formation is likely caused by a combination of factors, including the required template nucleotide conformational change and destabilized template-dCTP hydrogen bonding. Although additional aspects of the replication process, such as the impact of the adduct on the nucleotidyl-transfer reaction, may also be important for fully rationalizing experimental replication data and must be considered in future work, the present contribution emphasizes the importance of considering the effect of DNA damage on the early stages of the TLS process. © 2017 American Chemical Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034608347&amp;doi=10.1021%2facs.chemrestox.7b00179&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f7473728c07fdef70ba1c9ba93e05e80</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gounelas, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Free curves on varieties</title><secondary-title>Documenta Mathematica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Documenta Mathematica</full-title></periodical><pages>287-308</pages><volume>21</volume><number>2016</number><issue>2016</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>We study various generalisations of rationally connected varieties, allowing the connecting curves to be of higher genus.

Although the global rate of replication decreases, mammalian cells can respond to replication stress by activating new replication origins. We demonstrate that a moderate level of stress induced by inhibitors of topoisomerase I, commencing in early, mid or late S-phase, induces activation of new sites of replication located within or in the immediate vicinity of the original replication factories; only in early S some of these new sites are also activated at a distance greater than 300 nm. Under high stress levels very few new replication sites are activated; such sites are located within the original replication regions. There is a large variation in cellular response to stress – while in some cells the number of replication sites increases even threefold, it decreases almost twofold in other cells. Replication stress results in a loss of PCNA from replication factories and a twofold increase in nuclear volume. These observations suggest that activation of new replication origins from the pool of dormant origins within replication cluster under conditions of mild stress is generally restricted to the original replication clusters (factories) active at a time of stress initiation, while activation of distant origins and new replication factories is suppressed. © 2015 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943791752&amp;doi=10.1080%2f15384101.2015.1064566&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=63df26b0820efca3d6a516c4fc521cb3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Albrecht, E.C.</author><author>Khetani, M.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Environmental impact on young children's participation in home-based activities</title><secondary-title>Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology</full-title></periodical><pages>388-394</pages><volume>59</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/dmcn.13360</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aim: To test the effect of child, family, and environmental factors on young children's participation in home-based activities. Method: Caregivers of young children were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling. Participants were 395 caregivers of children (222 males, 173 females) aged from 1 month to 5 years and 11 months. Demographic items and the home section of the Young Children's Participation and Environment Measure were administered online, followed by completion of the daily activities, mobility, and social/cognitive domains of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test by telephone interview. Results: A structural equation model fitted the data well (comparative fit index=0.91) and explained 31.2% of the variance in perceived environmental support and 42.5% of the variance in home involvement. Functional limitations and performance had an indirect effect on young children's participation through their effect on perceived environmental support. Specifically, fewer functional limitations and higher task performance were associated with greater environmental support, which in turn predicted higher levels of home involvement. Interpretation: Results suggest the importance of a young child's functional abilities and task performance on caregiver perceptions of environmental support at home, and the impact of environmental support on a child's participation in home-based activities during the early childhood period. Results warrant replication with more diverse samples to evaluate model generalizability. © 2016 The Authors.

Here, we apply a novel statistical algorithm called Covariate-Modulated Mixture Modeling (CM3), which incorporates auxiliary information (heterozygosity, total linkage disequilibrium, genomic annotations, pleiotropy) for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to enable more accurate estimation of replication probabilities, conditional on the observed test statistic (“z-score”) of the SNP. We use a multiple logistic regression on z-scores to combine information from auxiliary information to derive a “relative enrichment score” for each SNP. For each stratum of these relative enrichment scores, we obtain nonparametric estimates of posterior expected test statistics and replication probabilities as a function of discovery z-scores, using a resampling-based approach that repeatedly and randomly partitions meta-analysis sub-studies into training and replication samples. We fit a scale mixture of two Gaussians model to each stratum, obtaining parameter estimates that minimize the sum of squared differences of the scale-mixture model with the stratified nonparametric estimates. We apply this approach to the recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of SCZ (n = 82,315), obtaining a good fit between the model-based and observed effect sizes and replication probabilities. We observed that SNPs with low enrichment scores replicate with a lower probability than SNPs with high enrichment scores even when both they are genome-wide significant (p &lt; 5x10-8). There were 693 and 219 independent loci with model-based replication rates ≥80% and ≥90%, respectively. Compared to analyses not incorporating relative enrichment scores, CM3 increased out-of-sample yield for SNPs that replicate at a given rate. This demonstrates that replication probabilities can be more accurately estimated using prior enrichment information with CM3. © 2016 Wang et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958730027&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1005803&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f1114d7734396808eeebdb1aa45afaaf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alves, M.L.</author><author>Gonçalves, F.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparing the development of identity and oddity relations using olfactory stimuli in rats</title><secondary-title>Acta Comportamentalia</secondary-title><short-title>Comparação entre a formação de relações de identidade e singularidade com estímulos olfativos em ratos</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Comportamentalia</full-title></periodical><pages>399-415</pages><volume>26</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Identity and oddity matching are relations derived from conditional discrimination processes that can be studied through matching-to-sample procedures. Generalized matching happens when the subject’s response is controlled by these relations even when novel stimuli are presented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the moment when the identity and oddity relations are generalized, considering how many pairs of stimuli are needed for demonstrating generalization. Six male Wistar rats were trained on an oddity matching-to-sample procedure, and four were trained on an identity matching-to-sample. The olfactory stimuli were cups filled with scented sand in which the rats should dig to obtain a sugar pellet according to either the identity or oddity contingency. The experiment was divided into three phases, each having the training of one pair of stimuli and, after meeting the training criteria, a generalization test with novel stimuli. For this experiment, generalization is considered if the subject matched consistently according to the trained relation in at least 91,67% of the trials during the last testing session of each phase. The experiment ended when generalization was demonstrated in any of the three phases. The applied training showed to be more effective for oddity than for identity relations since the oddity group learned the trained relations faster and five of the rats were able to demonstrate generalization according to the defined testing criteria. Also, within the oddity group, there were rats that demonstrated generalization with less training than three pairs of stimuli, indicating that training with a large number of stimuli is not necessary to show generalized oddity relations. For the identity group, the number of training sessions was higher and only one rat met the testing criteria. Another problem addressed in this study is the effect of the contingency used during testing sessions over the subject’s performance. Tests under extinction decreased the choice response rate after a few trials. Tests under an undifferentiated reinforcement contingency solved this problem, however, they don’t eliminate the possibility of discrimination between training and testing sessions, what also could impair the evaluation of generalization. The results indicate the need for further investigations on better ways to evaluate generalization and on the difference in the acquisition of the oddity and identity relations. © 2018 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.All Rights Reserved.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057995251&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a2ed83797d1b24c4bd990efd23d1b915</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luo, X.</author><author>Stavrakakis, N.</author><author>Penninx, B.W.</author><author>Bosker, F.J.</author><author>Nolen, W.A.</author><author>Boomsma, D.I.</author><author>de Geus, E.J.</author><author>Smit, J.H.</author><author>Snieder, H.</author><author>Nolte, I.M.</author><author>Hartman, C.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does refining the phenotype improve replication rates?

One possible reason is phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. The present study replicated genetic associations with MDD as defined in DSM-IV and with a more narrowly defined MDD subtype with a chronic and severe course. We first conducted a systematic review of genetic association studies on MDD published between September 2007 and June 2012 to identify all reported candidate genes. Genetic associations were then tested for all identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the entire genes using data from the GAIN genome-wide association study (MDD: n=1,352; chronic MDD subsample: n=225; controls: n= 1,649). The 1,000 Genomes database was used as reference for imputation. From 157 studies identified inthe literature, 81 studies reported significant associations with MDD, involving 245 polymorphisms in 97 candidate genes, from which we were able to investigate 185 SNPs in 89 genes. We replicated nine candidate SNPs in eight genes for MDD and six in five genes for chronic MDD. However, these were not more than expected by chance. At gene level, we replicated 18 genes for MDD and 17 genes for chronic MDD, both significantly more than expected by chance. We showed that replication rates were improved for MDD compared to a previous, highly similar, replication study based on studies published before 2007. Effect sizes of the SNPs and replication rates of the candidate genes were improved in the chronic subsample compared to the full sample. Nonetheless, replication rates were still poor. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958241084&amp;doi=10.1002%2fajmg.b.32396&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=382eb8f6788cdb1a8779a5daab0cb53e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, L.</author><author>Boland, M.R.</author><author>Miotto, R.</author><author>Tatonetti, N.P.</author><author>Dudley, J.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replicating Cardiovascular Condition-Birth Month Associations</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>6</volume><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep33166</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Independent replication is vital for study findings drawn from Electronic Health Records (EHR). This replication study evaluates the relationship between seasonal effects at birth and lifetime cardiovascular condition risk. We performed a Season-wide Association Study on 1,169,599 patients from Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) to compute phenome-wide associations between birth month and CVD. We then evaluated if seasonal patterns found at MSH matched those reported at Columbia University Medical Center. Coronary arteriosclerosis, essential hypertension, angina, and pre-infarction syndrome passed phenome-wide significance and their seasonal patterns matched those previously reported. Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and chronic myocardial ischemia had consistent patterns but were not phenome-wide significant. We confirm that CVD risk peaks for those born in the late winter/early spring among the evaluated patient populations. The replication findings bolster evidence for a seasonal birth month effect in CVD.

In this approach, original articles (i.e., parent studies) were selected via a stratified, random sampling procedure. Next, we examined all articles that referenced the parent articles (i.e., child studies) to determine the extent and nature of the replication of the original studies. Seventy-five percent of the parent studies were replicated by at least one child study. Across all parent studies, there were 39 replication child studies. Although there was a high overall replication rate, there were a limited number of conceptual replications, and no direct replication studies were identified. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2016.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977545940&amp;doi=10.1177%2f0741932516646081&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0d0229e943508fcda860d493a55d6220</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, J.</author><author>Yan, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproduction and community dynamics of staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina) in a coal-gangue area</title><secondary-title>Shengtai Xuebao</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Shengtai Xuebao</full-title></periodical><pages>195-199</pages><volume>36</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chnaes.2016.04.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Coal mining has caused severe damages to local environment, such as vegetation destruction and decrease in species diversity, which poses a great challenge for sustainable development. Ecological restoration, aiming to increase plant coverage and soil nutrients in coal-mine areas, is of great significance for improving environment quality. The restoration effort at the mineral resource-rich Gujiao coal mine is an example of ecological reconstruction in Shanxi Province. Staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina) was used as one of the main plant species for the ecological restoration in Gujiao. We surveyed staghorn sumac communities at four different restoration stages in a coal-gangue area in 2008 and 2009. The relationship between species diversity index and various environmental factors was analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient. Based on the investigation of vegetation and soil properties, the following parameters were analyzed: reproduction of staghorn sumac; dynamics of community structure; plant species diversity; and soil condition. The results showed that significant changes in community structure, species composition, and diversity occurred during a 12 years of restoration period. Pioneer species such as Artemisia scoparia and Setaria viridis played dominant roles at the early stage of restoration. However, these pioneer species were replaced by neutral species such as Poa sphondylodes and Bothriochloa ischaemum 5–8 years later. Community coverage increased quickly because of a high reproduction rate of staghorn sumac, leading to a vertical decrease in light intensity from the canopy to the forest floor. Meanwhile, species numbers in the herb layer decreased substantially. Due to vigorous sprouting reproduction, staghorn sumac colonized new habitats and expanded its population rapidly. Staghorn sumac became an exclusive edificator of the community 12 years later, and other species were greatly suppressed and nearly disappeared. Although soil organic matter, total N content, and available P content increased slightly during the restoration period, soil nutrients were still at a low level according to the soil fertility classification standards of the Second National Soil Survey in the 1980s. Therefore, the improvement to the soil condition was very limited. Pearson correlation suggested that soil fertility was a main factor influencing species diversity at the early stage of restoration, while light intensity became a leading factor after the canopy was closed. The vigorous sprouting reproduction of staghorn sumac was beneficial for increasing vegetation coverage of the coal-gangue area during a short time period. However, in the long term, staghorn sumac suppressed not only other species but also its own sprouts, resulting in high risks of degradation to the plant community. Therefore, caution should be taken when staghorn sumac is extensively planted for ecological reconstruction. Vegetation coverage, species diversity, and succession tendency should be used as main indices in an evaluation of ecological restoration. Moreover, our results suggest that low nutrient content is a disadvantage for vegetation restoration. Therefore, it is necessary to increase soil nutrients in ecological reconstruction in coal-gangue areas. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062334201&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.chnaes.2016.04.006&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c400ea851ed4e5a4c8530d521119bd47</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eid, F.-E.</author><author>Elhefnawi, M.</author><author>Heath, L.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DeNovo: Virus-host sequence-based protein-protein interaction prediction</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>1144-1150</pages><volume>32</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btv737</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Motivation Can we predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of a novel virus with its host? Three major problems arise: the lack of known PPIs for that virus to learn from, the cost of learning about its proteins and the sequence dissimilarity among viral families that makes most methods inapplicable or inefficient. We develop DeNovo, a sequence-based negative sampling and machine learning framework that learns from PPIs of different viruses to predict for a novel one, exploiting the shared host proteins. We tested DeNovo on PPIs from different domains to assess generalization. Results: By solving the challenge of generating less noisy negative interactions, DeNovo achieved accuracy up to 81 and 86% when predicting PPIs of viral proteins that have no and distant sequence similarity to the ones used for training, receptively. This result is comparable to the best achieved in single virus-host and intra-species PPI prediction cases. Thus, we can now predict PPIs for virtually any virus infecting human. DeNovo generalizes well; it achieved near optimal accuracy when tested on bacteria-human interactions. © 2015 The Author.

Analysing opportunistic capture–recapture data is often done by discretizing time intervals or summarizing data, but without taking into account the continuous time process of the state and/or the capture. To deal with non-constant time-intervals, continuous time closed capture–recapture models have been proposed by Yip, Huggins, and Lin (), Hwang and Chao (), Schofield, Barker, and Gelling () for estimating population size. More recently, a continuous time Cormack–Jolly–Seber model has been proposed by Fouchet, Santin-Janin, Sauvage, Yoccoz, and Pontier () to reduce bias in survival rates, and a two-state process has been proposed by Choquet, Garnier, Awuve, and Besnard () to estimate reproduction rates and survival rates of young within a season. The aim of the current study is to demonstrate how an approach based on a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP) (Freed &amp; Shepp,) allows, in a similar way to a multistate model, to model opportunistic data, using several states. To this end, several multistate models were rewritten as MMPP models, showing, the potential for this approach to address the ecological questions as multistate models, but using an extended data framework. In particular, it is a useful framework for dealing with data that has unordered levels of uncertainty. The methods were illustrated using simulations and analysis of data on the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). © 2018 The Author.

With aphasia therapy aiming to promote change in everyday communication, there is a temptation to “fish” for any evidence of improvement; multiple tasks, elicitation methods, and measures may be used to identify any change that might then be attributed to therapy. Examining the evidence about generalisation will allow us to develop our theoretical understanding of change following aphasia intervention and strengthen our ability to form robust predictions for generalisation that can be tested. Aims: We explore what is meant by generalisation, considering it within the broader context of impact of intervention. We propose a framework focusing on linguistic generalisation at the levels of word, sentence, and connected speech. The discussion draws on the therapy literature for spoken production, exploring single-word therapies for nouns and verbs, sentence production therapies, and discourse therapies. Main Contribution: This article introduces a framework to conceptualise and describe generalisation within level, i.e., change to untreated stimuli within the same linguistic level as the focus of treatment, and across level, i.e., change at a different linguistic level to the focus of treatment. The existing evidence base for spoken production is reviewed using the framework, considering our current knowledge, the predictions we are able to make, and areas for future focus. Conclusions: There is an urgent need for further research in this area. While within-level generalisation has often been addressed systematically, there have been more limited attempts to systematically define, predict, and measure generalisation across linguistic levels. This has resulted in a limited evidence base from which to make decisions regarding when and how to best facilitate generalisation and where and how to best measure generalisation. We propose it is time to stop fishing for change in an opportunistic way and to develop a greater understanding of the relationship between change at the different linguistic levels of words, sentences, and connected speech. We need to use theory and evidence to predict change (selecting the right “pond” within which to fish) and identify valid and reliable ways to measure both targeted and generalised therapy effects (selecting the right “bait”). © 2015 Taylor &amp; Francis.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940962753&amp;doi=10.1080%2f02687038.2015.1027169&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=12e75c3859385ca1bd864feca1d5a51d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Plavén-Sigray, P.</author><author>Matheson, G.J.</author><author>Gustavsson, P.</author><author>Stenkrona, P.</author><author>Halldin, C.</author><author>Farde, L.</author><author>Cervenka, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Is dopamine D1 receptor availability related to social behavior?

So far, only one study has focused on the dopamine D1-receptor (D1-R), finding a positive correlation with the trait social desirability, which is characterized by low dominant and high affiliative behavior, while physical aggression showed a negative correlation. The aim of the present study was to replicate these previous findings using a new independent sample of subjects. Materials and methods: Twenty-six healthy males were examined with the radioligand [11C]SCH-23390, and completed the Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP) which includes measures of social desirability and physical trait aggression. The simplified reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference region was used to calculate BPND values in the whole striatum and limbic striatum. The two regions were selected since they showed strong association between D1-R availability and personality scores in the previous study. Pearson's correlation coefficients and replication Bayes factors were then employed to assess the replicability and robustness of previous results. Results: There were no significant correlations (all p values &gt; 0.3) between regional BPND values and personality scale scores. Replication Bayes factors showed strong to moderate evidence in favor no relationship between D1-receptor availability and social desirability (striatum BF01 = 12.4; limbic striatum BF01 = 7.2) or physical aggression scale scores (limbic striatum BF01 = 3.3), compared to the original correlations. Discussion: We could not replicate the previous findings of associations between D1-R availability and either pro- or antisocial behavior as measured using the SSP. Rather, there was evidence in favor of failed replications of associations between BPND and scale scores. Potential reasons for these results are restrictive variance in both PET and personality outcomes due to high sample homogeneity, or that the previous findings were false positives. © 2018 Plavén-Sigray et al.

Replication is a common validation method in GWASs. We regard an association as true finding when it shows significance in both primary and replication studies. A question worth pondering is what is the probability of a primary association (i.e. a statistically significant association in the primary study) being validated in the replication study? This article systematically reviews the answers to this question from different points of view. As Bayesian methods can help us integrate out the uncertainty about the underlying effect of the primary association, we will mainly focus on the Bayesian view in this article. We refer the Bayesian replication probability as the replication rate (RR). We further describe an estimation method for RR, which makes use of the summary statistics from the primary study. We can use the estimated RR to determine the sample size of the replication study and to check the consistency between the results of the primary study and those of the replication study.We describe an R-package to estimate and apply RR in GWASs. Simulation and real data experiments show that the estimated RR has good prediction and calibration performance. We also use these data to demonstrate the usefulness of RR.

The aim of this study was to assess potential biomarkers to predict outcomes for people with IPF. Methods PROFILE is a large prospective longitudinal cohort of treatment-naive patients with IPF. We adopted a two-stage discovery and validation design using patients from the PROFILE cohort. For the discovery analysis, we examined 106 patients and 50 age and sex matched healthy controls from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and the Royal Brompton Hospital. We did an unbiased, multiplex immunoassay assessment of 123 biomarkers. We further investigated promising novel markers by immunohistochemical assessment of IPF lung tissue. In the validation analysis, we examined samples from 206 people with IPF from among the remaining 212 patients recruited to PROFILE Central England. We used the samples to attempt to replicate the biomarkers identified from the discovery analysis by use of independent immunoassays for each biomarker. We investigated the predictive power of the selected biomarkers to identify individuals with IPF who were at risk of progression or death. The PROFILE studies are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01134822 (PROFILE Central England) and NCT01110694 (PROFILE Royal Brompton Hospital). Findings In the discovery analysis, we identified four serum biomarkers (surfactant protein D, matrix metalloproteinase 7, CA19-9, and CA-125) that were suitable for replication. Histological assessment of CA19-9 and CA-125 suggested that these proteins were markers of epithelial damage. Replication analysis showed that baseline values of surfactant protein D (46·6 ng/mL vs 34·6 ng/mL, p=0·0018) and CA19-9 (53·7 U/mL vs 22·2 U/mL; p&lt;0·0001) were significantly higher in patients with progressive disease than in patients with stable disease, and rising concentrations of CA-125 over 3 months were associated with increased risk of mortality (HR 2·542, 95% CI 1·493–4·328, p=0·00059). Interpretation We have identified serum proteins secreted from metaplastic epithelium that can be used to predict disease progression and death in IPF.

The evaluation of generalization result is a key issue in the field of automated map generalization. This paper proposes a road density partition method for the evaluation of road selection. The method first creates the Voronoi diagram of road intersections and endpoints, and then uses the Getis-ord Gi∗ statistic to identify the statistically significant (at the confidence level of 95%) spatial clusters of high values and low values of Voronoi cells' areas. Finally, the method merges the neighboring Voronoi cells corresponding to those clusters. The road network of Wuhan at the levels of 15, 13 and 11 of the Google Maps was used as experimental data to evaluate the road network selection result of the proposed method. The experiment result showed that the road density partitioning with the proposed method generally well reflects the road network density in each area and contrast between different areas before and after road selection. Meanwhile, the proposed method was proved to be superior to the grid density method. © 2015 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962449166&amp;doi=10.1109%2fGEOINFORMATICS.2015.7378650&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=618340b2363cd0c0cf6793f2c79d2fd8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heid, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 2008 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP): A visual arts replication study</title><secondary-title>Arts Education Policy Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arts Education Policy Review</full-title></periodical><pages>73-86</pages><volume>117</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/10632913.2015.1007405</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The 2008 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Arts Assessment was administered to selected 8th grade students throughout the nation, and in 2009 the results from that administration were publicly reported. In the spring of 2010, building on the format and structure of the 2008 national assessment, the researcher administered a self-portrait test locally to 166 students across three regions in a small southeastern state. In replicating the content and process as closely as possible given the publicly available resources, the purpose of this study was to compare the reported 2008 NAEP self-portrait scores with the results of the 2010 replication study self-portrait scores. Specifically, given that all schools in this small state are required to have dedicated art teachers for K–8 schools, a requirement not typical in all states, the researcher sought to understand the degree to which the local performance mirrored the national scores. After confirming that this study met the requirements to be considered a replication study, the researcher determined that based on comparative results from the 2008 NEAP test and 2010 replication assessment, there was evidence that supported having a stand-alone art teacher in K–8 schools. In fact, the researcher affirmed that early and consistent exposure to art and art making is consistent with a student's positive performance on NAEP Arts Assessments. © 2016 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041678401&amp;doi=10.1080%2f10632913.2015.1007405&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=11e1c18c72cb85019b17a46526d0c77f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Graff, M.</author><author>Emery, L.S.</author><author>Justice, A.E.</author><author>Parra, E.</author><author>Below, J.E.</author><author>Palmer, N.D.</author><author>Gao, C.</author><author>Duan, Q.</author><author>Valladares-Salgado, A.</author><author>Cruz, M.</author><author>Morrison, A.C.</author><author>Boerwinkle, E.</author><author>Whitsel, E.A.</author><author>Kooperberg, C.</author><author>Reiner, A.</author><author>Li, Y.</author><author>Rodriguez, C.J.</author><author>Talavera, G.A.</author><author>Langefeld, C.D.</author><author>Wagenknecht, L.E.</author><author>Norris, J.M.</author><author>Taylor, K.D.</author><author>Papanicolaou, G.</author><author>Kenny, E.</author><author>Loos, R.J.F.</author><author>Chen, Y.-D.I.</author><author>Laurie, C.</author><author>Sofer, T.</author><author>North, K.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic architecture of lipid traits in the Hispanic community health study/study of Latinos</title><secondary-title>Lipids in Health and Disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lipids in Health and Disease</full-title></periodical><volume>16</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12944-017-0591-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Despite ethnic disparities in lipid profiles, there are few genome-wide association studies investigating genetic variation of lipids in non-European ancestry populations. In this study, we present findings from genetic association analyses for total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and triglycerides in a large Hispanic/Latino cohort in the U.S., the Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). Methods: We estimated a heritability of approximately 20% for each lipid trait, similar to previous estimates in Europeans. To search for novel lipid loci, we performed conditional association analysis in which the statistical model was adjusted for previously reported SNPs associated with any of the four lipid traits. SNPs that remained genome-wide significant (P &lt; 5 × 10-8) after conditioning on known loci were evaluated for replication. Results: We identified eight potentially novel lipid signals with minor allele frequencies &lt;1%, none of which replicated. We tested previously reported SNP-trait associations for generalization to Hispanics/Latinos via a statistical framework. The generalization analysis revealed that approximately 50% of previously established lipid variants generalize to HCHS/SOL based on directional FDR r-value &lt; 0.05. Some failures to generalize were due to lack of power. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that many loci associated with lipid levels are shared across populations. © 2017 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031109774&amp;doi=10.1186%2fs12944-017-0591-6&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=28116adbafe1e9e594ac249377274978</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oliveira, R.J.P.</author><author>Gatiboni, L.C.</author><author>Brunetto, G.</author><author>Miquelluti, D.J.</author><author>Valicheski, R.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Response of beet fertilization with nitrogen, sulfur and micronutrients in a Cambisol</title><secondary-title>Horticultura Brasileira</secondary-title><short-title>Resposta da beterraba a adubação com nitrogênio, enxofre e micronutrientes em um Cambissolo Háplico</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Horticultura Brasileira</full-title></periodical><pages>63-68</pages><volume>35</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/S0102-053620170110</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There are few studies in Brazil aiming to calibrate fertilization of macro and micronutrients for beet in Southern Brazil. Two experiments were carried out, one in the field and another in a greenhouse with the objectives: a) under field conditions, to access the response of beet to nitrogen (N) in the presence or absence of a single rate of sulfur (S), boron (B), zinc (Zn) and molybdenum (Mo); b) in a greenhouse experiment to evaluate the response of plants to S, B, Zn and Mo. The experiment 1 was carried out in a Cambisol with 270 g/kg clay and 33 g/kg organic matter. Treatments were N rates (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg/ha N) in presence or absence of fertilization with S, Zn, B and Mo in dosages of 50; 2; 1 and 0.01 kg/ ha, respectively, in a 5×2 factorial design with randomized blocks and four replications. In experiment 2 we used the same soil of experiment 1, in a greenhouse in pots of 3.0 kg soil. Six treatments were tested: (control, addition of S, of B, of Zn, or of Mo and addition of S, Zn, B and Mo) in a completely randomized design with five replications. The rates of nutrients were the same as used in experiment 1, while the remaining nutrients (P and K) were added in all treatments following the technical recommendations for the crop. At 60 days after transplantation, the plants of both experiments were collected and separated in leaves and roots for the determination of fresh and dry matter and determination of N, S, B and Zn in plant tissue. We observed a significant effect for factor N on plants reaching maximum productivity with the application of 100 kg/ha N in the presence of S, Zn, B and Mo, whose addition nearly doubled the production of roots. The experiment in the greenhouse showed that sulfur was the nutrient, after N, responsible for increasing the production observed in experiment 1. © 2017, Sociedade de Olericultura do Brasil.

It combines effect-size estimation with hypothesis testing, assessing the extent to which the replication results are consistent with an effect size big enough to have been detectable in the original study.

Its benefits include the following: (a) differentiating “unsuccessful” replication attempts (i.e., studies yielding p &gt;.05) that are too noisy from those that actively indicate the effect is undetectably different from zero, (b) “protecting” true findings from underpowered replications, and (c) arriving at intuitively compelling inferences in general and for the revisited replications in particular. © The Author(s) 2015</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930587816&amp;doi=10.1177%2f0956797614567341&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0bd657b200ec774ba5936be3b480ceeb</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stewart, R.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conditional choice with a vacuous second tier</title><secondary-title>Synthese</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Synthese</full-title></periodical><pages>219-243</pages><volume>193</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11229-015-0754-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper studies a generalization of rational choice theory. I briefly review the motivations that Helzner gives for his conditional choice construction (2013). Then, I focus on the important class of conditional choice functions with vacuous second tiers. This class is interesting for both formal and philosophical reasons. I argue that this class makes explicit one of conditional choice’s normative motivations in terms of an account of neutrality advocated within a certain tradition in decision theory. The observations recorded—several of which are generalizations of central results in the standard theory of rational choice—are intended to provide further insight into how conditional choice generalizes the standard account and are offered as additional evidence of the fruitfulness of the conditional choice framework. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957848671&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs11229-015-0754-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4bef964aedfd6a8de0d5876454437b86</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kang, Y.B.</author><author>Rawat, S.</author><author>Duchemin, N.</author><author>Bouchard, M.</author><author>Noh, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human liver sinusoid on a chip for hepatitis B virus replication study</title><secondary-title>Micromachines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Micromachines</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/mi8010027</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We have developed a miniature human liver (liver-sinusoid-on-a-chip) model using a dual microchannel separated by a porous membrane. Primary human hepatocytes and immortalized bovine aortic endothelial cells were co-cultured on opposite sides of a microporous membrane in a dual microchannel with continuous perfusion. Primary human hepatocytes in this system retained their polygonal morphology for up to 26 days, while hepatocytes cultured in the absence of bovine aortic endothelial cells lost their morphology within a week. In order to demonstrate the utility of our human-liver-sinusoid-on-a-chip, human hepatocytes in this system were directly infected by Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). Expression of the HBV core antigen was detected in human hepatocytes in the microchannel system. HBV replication, measured by the presence of cell-secreted HBV DNA, was also detected. Importantly, HBV is hepatotropic, and expression of HBV RNA transcripts is dependent upon expression of hepatocyte-specific factors. Moreover, HBV infection requires expression of the human-hepatocyte-specific HBV cell surface receptor. Therefore, the ability to detect HBV replication and Hepatitis B core Antigen (HBcAg) expression in our microfluidic platform confirmed that hepatocyte differentiation and functions were retained throughout the time course of our studies. We believe that our human-liver-sinusoid-on-a-chip could have many applications in liver-related research and drug development. © 2017 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011258193&amp;doi=10.3390%2fmi8010027&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=71a235749bb59efea30a32eeba2b1152</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Czyżowski, P.</author><author>Karpiński, M.</author><author>Goleman, M.</author><author>Drozd, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quality of individual roe deer males (Capreolus capreolus L.) during the 5-month-long hunting season: Possible impact on the reproduction rate</title><secondary-title>Polish Journal of Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Polish Journal of Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>291-296</pages><volume>63</volume><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3161/15052249PJE2015.63.2.013</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this study was to assess changes in parameters (body weight, fat stores, antler weight, serum creatinine level) describing the condition of individual roe deer males (Capreolus capreolus) in subsequent months of the hunting season. The idea was if the current timing of the buck hunting season affects the quality of specimens obtained from the population, which may result in distorting its reproduction-related processes. The study included 443 carcasses of bucks harvested in the Lublin region (Central Poland) from 2006 to 2011. The average carcass weight in May and June was significantly higher than in the other months. Perirenal fat weight and the kidney fat index (KFI) decreased with the progression of the hunting season. With regard to the average level of serum creatinine in blood, there was no definite trend in the variation of this parameter during the hunting season. However, a significantly higher average antler weight was observed in May compared to June. The shooting of a large number of bucks in the first weeks of the hunting season may cause the elimination of the best individuals in the habitat, which have established and maintained their territory and are fully prepared for reproduction. This results in a complete disruption of the social structure of the local deer population. A solution to this problem could be uniform distribution of volume harvested during the whole hunting season or postponing the hunting season for bucks until September, when the estrus season has finished, and the strongest males have passed on their valuable genes to the population. © 2015, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The patients were all men who have sex with men (MSM) and inhabited several metropolitan areas of Japan, suggesting that the recombinant strains may be circulating among high-risk groups such as MSM. Here, we investigated the genomic structure and virological properties of the HBV/G/A2 strains. Methods: Complete genome sequences of the isolates were determined and phylogenetically analyzed. Replication efficiency of HBV/G/A2 was investigated by transfecting plasmids containing 1.24-fold viral genome. The in vivo viral kinetics of HBV/G/A2 were investigated using chimeric mice with humanized livers. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the four strains were almost identical (&gt;99.7% homologous). The preS2/S region of these strains was highly homologous to that of genotype A2 and the remaining region was almost identical to that of genotype G, reflecting inter-genotypic recombination. Interestingly, in all four cases, genotype A was co-infected as a minor population. In vitro analysis revealed that HBV/G/A2 had a low replication rate. Although detectable viremia was not measurable following the inoculation of HBV/G/A2 into chimeric mice, subsequent superinfection of HBV genotype A greatly enhanced HBV/G/A2 replication and viral spread. Conclusion: We found that four cases of HBV/G/A2 recombinant among MSM patients in the metropolitan areas of Japan, and HBV/A co-infections are required for its efficient replication. High-risk groups such as MSM should be carefully tested for infection of genotype G-derived variants. © 2015 The Japan Society of Hepatology</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977650409&amp;doi=10.1111%2fhepr.12612&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7094d2277acf1a27ba59cd4498fe8ae4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Solari, M.</author><author>Vegas, S.</author><author>Juristo, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Content and structure of laboratory packages for software engineering experiments</title><secondary-title>Information and Software Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information and Software Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>64-79</pages><volume>97</volume><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.infsof.2017.12.016</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Context: Experiment replications play a central role in the scientific method. Although software engineering experimentation has matured a great deal, the number of experiment replications is still relatively small. Software engineering experiments are composed of complex concepts, procedures and artefacts. Laboratory packages are a means of transferring knowledge among researchers to facilitate experiment replications. Objective: This paper investigates the experiment replication process to find out what information is needed to successfully replicate an experiment. Our objective is to propose the content and structure of laboratory packages for software engineering experiments. Method: We evaluated seven replications of three different families of experiments. Each replication had a different experimenter who was, at the time, unfamiliar with the experiment. During the first iterations of the study, we identified experimental incidents and then proposed a laboratory package structure that addressed these incidents, including document usability improvements. We used the later iterations to validate and generalize the laboratory package structure for use in all software engineering experiments. We aimed to solve a specific problem, while at the same time looking at how to contribute to the body of knowledge on laboratory packages. Results: We generated a laboratory package for three different experiments. These packages eased the replication of the respective experiments. The evaluation that we conducted shows that the laboratory package proposal is acceptable and reduces the effort currently required to replicate experiments in software engineering. Conclusion: We think that the content and structure that we propose for laboratory packages can be useful for other software engineering experiments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039859341&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.infsof.2017.12.016&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1e34d44da07b1ff01646525dbd713ab1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Premkumar, R.</author><author>Anand, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Secured permutation and substitution based image encryption algorithm for medical security applications</title><secondary-title>Journal of Medical Imaging and Health Informatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Medical Imaging and Health Informatics</full-title></periodical><pages>2012-2018</pages><volume>6</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1166/jmihi.2016.1966</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Privacy is a vital issue in transmitting or getting the advanced pictures over people in general systems. Picture encryption is a superior answer for accomplish a high security. In recent years, quantities of strategies have been proposed in the writing for picture encryption. The restriction of conventional cipher methods is insecurity upon known plain image attack and their development of the picture is not delicate to changes in plain picture. We proposed an efficient Secured Asymmetric Image Cipher (SAIC) Algorithm in which a secret key of variable size is used. Initially, two different keys are generated by using KG algorithm. One key is utilized for encryption and another is utilized for unscrambling process. By using the encryption key, the original image is scrambled by mixing process. The partially encrypted picture is isolated into element squares and the pieces are further prepared by key dependent permutation and substitution process to get the resultant encrypted image. The decrypted picture is gotten by processing the encrypted image through inverse substitution, inverse permutation and inverse mixing process using the decryption key. Experimental result shows that original image is independent than the encrypted image (NPCR &gt; 99.99%, UACI &gt; 36.7%, DR &gt; 97%). The proposed method is easy to execute, computationally secure and has high encryption rate.

Method: Undergraduate participants played a computer game requiring them to learn which stimuli (beans) would increase/decrease their points. Later, participants classified the valence of game beans and novel ones varying in resemblance to game beans. The weighting bias in attitude generalization was estimated as the average response to novel beans, controlling for game bean learning. We examined whether this bias related to judgments of hypothetical situations concerning interpersonal relationships (Study 1), threat assessment (Study 2), risk propensities (Study 3), and risk behavior (Study 6). We also assessed whether valence weighting is specifically predictive of novel situations (Studies 4 and 5). Finally, we explored participants' ability to self-report their weighting bias (Study 7). Results: Valence weighting in attitude generalization was related to judgments of novel situations and risk behavior. The performance-based measure did not correlate with responses to various questionnaires related to valence weighting. Conclusions: There is a fundamental individual difference associated with valence weighting, resulting in the relation between two processes unrelated in content, but sharing the essential characteristic of valence weighting-attitude generalization and evaluation of novel situations. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875495467&amp;doi=10.1111%2fj.1467-6494.2012.00800.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8ce54904225f779796c61d488ef0175f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olsson, J.A.</author><author>Berg, O.</author><author>Nordström, K.</author><author>Dasgupta, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eclipse period of R1 plasmids during downshift from elevated copy number: Nonrandom selection of copies for replication</title><secondary-title>Plasmid</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plasmid</full-title></periodical><pages>191-198</pages><volume>67</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.plasmid.2012.01.007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The classical Meselson-Stahl density-shift method was used to study replication of pOU71, a runaway-replication derivative of plasmid R1 in . Escherichia coli. The miniplasmid maintained the normal low copy number of R1 during steady growth at 30. °C, but as growth temperatures were raised above 34. °C, the copy number of the plasmid increased to higher levels, and at 42. °C, it replicated without control in a runaway replication mode with lethal consequences for the host. The eclipse periods (minimum time between successive replication of the same DNA) of the plasmid shortened with rising copy numbers at increasing growth temperatures (. Olsson et al., 2003). In this work, eclipse periods were measured during downshifts in copy number of pOU71 after it had replicated at 39 and 42. °C, resulting in 7- and 50-fold higher than normal plasmid copy number per cell, respectively. Eclipse periods for plasmid replication, measured during copy number downshift, suggested that plasmid R1, normally selected randomly for replication, showed a bias such that a newly replicated DNA had a higher probability of replication compared to the bulk of the R1 population. However, even the unexpected nonrandom replication followed the copy number kinetics such that every generation, the plasmids underwent the normal inherited number of replication, . n, independent of the actual number of plasmid copies in a newborn cell. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859004315&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.plasmid.2012.01.007&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a6b5cc65f859652c9ee966ac23324daf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pednekar, V.</author><author>Weerasooriya, S.</author><author>Jasti, V.P.</author><author>Basu, A.K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutagenicity and genotoxicity of (5′ s)-8,5′-cyclo-2′- deoxyadenosine in escherichia coli and replication of (5′ s)-8,5′-cyclopurine-2′-deoxynucleosides in vitro by dna polymerase iv, exo-free klenow fragment, and dpo4</title><secondary-title>Chemical Research in Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical Research in Toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>200-210</pages><volume>27</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/tx4002786</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reactive oxygen species generate many lesions in DNA, including R and S diastereomers of 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyadenosine (cdA) and 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyguanosine (cdG). Herein, the result of replication of a plasmid containing S-cdA in Escherichia coli is reported. S-cdA was found mutagenic and highly genotoxic. Viability and mutagenicity of the S-cdA construct were dependent on functional pol V, but mutational frequencies (MFs) and types varied in pol II-and pol IV-deficient strains relative to the wild-type strain. Both S-cdA → T and S-cdA → G substitutions occurred in equal frequency in wild-type E. coli, but the frequency of S-cdA → G dropped in pol IV-deficient strain, especially when being SOS induced. This suggests that pol IV plays a role in S-cdA → G mutations. MF increased significantly in pol II-deficient strain, suggesting pol II's likely role in error-free translesion synthesis. Primer extension and steady-state kinetic studies using pol IV, exo-free Klenow fragment (KF (exo-)), and Dpo4 were performed to further assess the replication efficiency and fidelity of S-cdA and S-cdG. Primer extension by pol IV mostly stopped before the lesion, although a small fraction was extended opposite the lesion. Kinetic studies showed that pol IV incorporated dCMP almost as efficiently as dTMP opposite S-cdA, whereas it incorporated the correct nucleotide dCMP opposite S-cdG 10-fold more efficiently than any other dNMP. Further extension of each lesion containing pair, however, was very inefficient. These results are consistent with the role of pol IV in S-cdA → G mutations in E. coli. KF (exo -) was also strongly blocked by both lesions, but it could slowly incorporate the correct nucleotide opposite them. In contrast, Dpo4 could extend a small fraction of the primer to a full-length product on both S-cdG and S-cdA templates. Dpo4 incorporated dTMP preferentially opposite S-cdA over the other dNMPs, but the discrimination was only 2-to 8-fold more proficient. Further extension of the S-cdA:T and S-cdA:C pair was not much different. For S-cdG, conversely, the wrong nucleotide, dTMP, was incorporated more efficiently than dCMP, although one-base extension of the S-cdG:T pair was less efficient than the S-cdG:C pair. S-cdG, therefore, has the propensity to cause G → A transition, as was reported to occur in E. coli. The results of this study are consistent with the strong replication blocking nature of S-cdA and S-cdG, and their ability to initiate error-prone synthesis by Y-family DNA polymerases. © 2014 American Chemical Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894260933&amp;doi=10.1021%2ftx4002786&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=047875b2e4323c3c9fbc29976035009f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luo, H.</author><author>Guo, M.</author><author>Xie, Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Object selection in map generalization using geosocial network data: A case study in Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>Geomatica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomatica</full-title></periodical><pages>83-93</pages><volume>69</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5623/cig2015-106</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In map generalization, determining which objects are to be selected is a challenging task in the selection operation. Decisions surrounding object selection depend on object semantics and spatial context. The advent of geosocial network services, such as Foursquare and Twitter, provides an evaluation system for physical space. These services have generated a wealth of geographic information that can reflect human mobility and urban dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to use the geographic information from geosocial networks as a reference for map generalization and subsequently transform the semantic-based selection operator into a simple statistical method. Analysing this geographic information quantitatively and acquiring the value of each object is the key of this research. The present study has organized an investigation using data from a geosocial network service, named Jiepang in Wuhan, China. The experiment was conducted by adopting spatial analysis and heavy-tailed distribution, which consisted of the following steps: first, semi-variance modelling was conducted for the distance threshold, to measure the magnitude of the effect of spatial dependence; a buffer analysis was then completed using a radius of this distance threshold and inverse distance weighting was applied to calculate the value of the geographic object; last, a head/tail division rule, a new principle based on heavy-tailed distribution, was used to select objects at different levels of detail. Though it is difficult to evaluate map generalization, the result demonstrates a different map. Furthermore, for a better understanding of the result, the method used in this study is compared to OpenStreetMap and essential differences between the two are discussed. This study successfully demonstrates that geosocial network data can be used as important criteria for object selection. © 2015, (publisher).

The presence of sufficient description of the intervention in each trial to allow its reproduction elsewhere was evaluated. Descriptive analyses were carried out. Despite reference to a detailed procedures manual in the majority of trials, these manuals were not easily accessible, limiting the replication of studies.

Hence, we develop a phylodynamic method that enables the joint estimation of epidemiological parameters and phylogenetic history. Based on a compartmental susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, this method provides separate information on incidence and prevalence of infections. Detailed information on the interaction of host population dynamics and evolutionary history can inform decisions on how to contain or entirely avoid disease outbreaks. We apply our birth-death SIR method to two viral datasets. First, five HIV type 1 clusters sampled in the UK between 1999 and 2003 are analysed. The estimated basic reproduction ratios range from 1.9 to 3.2 among the clusters. All clusters show a decline in the growth rate of the local epidemic in the middle or end of the 1990s. The analysis of a hepatitis C virus genotype 2c dataset shows that the local epidemic in the Córdoban city Cruz del Eje originated around 1906 (median), coinciding with an immigration wave from Europe to central Argentina that dates from 1880 to 1920. The estimated time of epidemic peak is around 1970. © 2014 The Authors.

The three farmlets (each of 53 ha) included one (farmlet B) subjected to 'typical' district management consisting of moderate levels of inputs and a target stocking rate of 7.5 dse/ha, with flexible grazing management across eight paddocks. A second farmlet (A) was managed in a similar fashion to farmlet B with respect to number of paddocks and grazing management, but modified by high rates of pasture renovation and higher levels of soil fertility, with a target stocking rate of 15 dse/ha. The third farmlet (C) was managed at the same level of moderate inputs as farmlet B but employed intensive rotational grazing over 37 paddocks and also had a high target stocking rate of 15 dse/ha. The experiment was conducted over 6.5 years from July 2000 to December 2006. In spite of the fact that target levels of stocking rate were chosen at the beginning of the experiment, stocking rate, together with fat scores and reproduction were treated as emergent properties of each farmlet system. Joining took place in April-May and lambing occurred in September-October of each year. Over the first 2 years of the experiment, there were few differences among farmlets in ewe fat scores or reproductive performance. From 2003 onwards, while the percentage of ewes pregnant was similar between farmlets, the average proportion of multiple births (ewes scanned in late July, with twins) was 30%, 16% and 12%, respectively, on farmlets A-C. However, lamb losses were greater on farmlet A, with average lamb mortalities recorded on farmlets A-C of 29%, 10% and 19%, respectively. Over the duration of the experiment, ewes on farmlets A and B were more often above a fat score level of 3, and less often below 2.5, than were ewes from farmlet C. Differences among farmlet ewes in fat score were found to be significant in 7 of the total of 13 assessments over the duration of the experiment. A generalised additive model applied to whole-farmlet data showed that green digestible herbage, legume herbage, stocking rate, the amount of supplement fed and especially the proportion of each farmlet grazed at any one time all influenced fat scores of ewes. While fat scores and conception rates tended to be highest on farmlet A, farmlet B had slightly better reproductive outcomes due to less lambing losses, whereas ewes on farmlet C tended to have somewhat lower fat scores and levels of reproduction. These farmlet-scale findings highlighted the importance for livestock managers to focus not only on grazing management, stocking rate and stock density during lambing, but also on the availability of sufficient green, and especially legume herbage, and the difficulty of overcoming a deficit in quality herbage with supplementation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884572947&amp;doi=10.1071%2fAN12440&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c7dc91379fd9b57d1779c67fdb12b281</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Y.</author><author>Li, W.</author><author>Wang, J.</author><author>Bi, J.</author><author>Su, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determination of rutin in cigarette tobacco, filters, mainstream smoke and burned ash of different branded cigarettes by high performance liquid chromatography</title><secondary-title>Molecules</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecules</full-title></periodical><pages>3751-3760</pages><volume>17</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/molecules17043751</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Tobacco consists of at least 3,800 chemical constituents. Among them, rutin is an important polyphenolic secondary metabolite in tobacco, which has positive actions such as antiallergic, anti-inflammatory and vasoactive, antitumor, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-protozoal properties. A high performance liquid chromatography method was used to analyze rutin in tobacco and filters, mainstream smoke, and burned ash of ten varieties of cigarettes made in China. The chromatographic analysis was performed on a Hypersil ODS2 column with a gradient elution of acetonitrile and water at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Detection was carried out at 350 nm using a photodiode array detector. The calibration curves for the determination of analytes showed good linearity over the investigated ranges (R 2 &gt; 0.9998). Precision and reproducibility were evaluated by six replicated analyses, and the R.S.D. values were less than 0.59% and 1.53%. The recoveries were between 98.47 and 100.84%. Under the optimized conditions, namely 45 mL/g of solvent to solid ratio, 30 min of extraction time and 200 W of ultrasound power, the concentrations of rutin in tobacco and filter, mainstream smoke, burned ash of different brands cigarettes were 10.20-63.98, 0.10-0.32, 0.06-0.16 and 0 μg/per cigarette, respectively. © 2012 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860261895&amp;doi=10.3390%2fmolecules17043751&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=19d1f1bdf46006c6bcd06864e6f112bd</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sardanyés, J.</author><author>Martínez, F.</author><author>Daròs, J.-A.</author><author>Elena, S.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamics of alternative modes of RNA replication for positive-sense RNA viruses</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</full-title></periodical><pages>768-776</pages><volume>9</volume><number>69</number><issue>69</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rsif.2011.0471</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We propose and study nonlinear mathematical models describing the intracellular time dynamics of viral RNA accumulation for positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Our models consider different replication modes ranging between two extremes represented by the geometric replication (GR) and the linear stamping machine replication (SMR). We first analyse a model that quantitatively reproduced experimental data for the accumulation dynamics of both polarities of turnip mosaic potyvirus RNAs.We identify a non-degenerate transcritical bifurcation governing the extinction of both strands depending on three key parameters: the mode of replication (α), the replication rate (r) and the degradation rate (δ) of viral strands. Our results indicate that the bifurcation associatedwitha generically takes place when the replication mode is closer to the SMR, thus suggesting that GR may provide viral strands with an increased robustness against degradation. This transcritical bifurcation, which is responsible for the switching from an active to an absorbing regime, suggests a smooth (i.e. second-order), absorbing-state phase transition. Finally, we also analyse a simplified model that only incorporates asymmetry in replication tied to differential replication modes. © 2011 The Royal Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859388856&amp;doi=10.1098%2frsif.2011.0471&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6973b632204f05e03216c287c3a3d6a2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Deeley, S.T.</author><author>Love, A.W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Longitudinal analysis of the emotion self-confidence model of suicidal ideation in adolescents</title><secondary-title>Advances in Mental Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Mental Health</full-title></periodical><pages>34-45</pages><volume>12</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5172/jamh.2013.12.1.34</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To explain the emergence of suicidal ideation within an individual we developed the emotion self-confidence model of suicidal ideation (ESC-SI Model). The model proposes that, when faced with the stressor of negative emotionality, an individual with low expectations for coping with or changing the negative emotionality (low emotion self-confidence) is more likely to consider suicidal ideation. A preliminary study in adolescents supported this hypothesis. The present paper investigated the model more fully; following up 71 adolescents 2.2-3.7 years later. The main aims were to: (a) provide further validation of the ESC-SI Model through replication; (b) evaluate stability and change in key variables over time; (c) assess the causal hypothesis that emotion self-confidence appraisals would predict later suicidal ideation. Cross-sectional analysis replicated results obtained at baseline, supporting the model. Longitudinal analysis showed negative emotionality to be moderately stable, emotion self-confidence highly stable, and suicidal ideation highly variable, over time. Baseline emotion self-confidence did not explain unique variance in later suicidal ideation, failing to establish a causal relationship over this time frame. Links between emotion self-confidence and suicidal ideation were strongest during concurrent observations; a future focus on specific emotional experiences is recommended. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893184766&amp;doi=10.5172%2fjamh.2013.12.1.34&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8bb532a9797ac2eb452715c967780332</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leng, S.</author><author>Do, K.</author><author>Yingling, C.M.</author><author>Picchi, M.A.</author><author>Wolf, H.J.</author><author>Kennedy, T.C.</author><author>Feser, W.J.</author><author>Baron, A.E.</author><author>Franklin, W.A.</author><author>Brock, M.V.</author><author>Herman, J.G.</author><author>Baylin, S.B.</author><author>Byers, T.</author><author>Stidley, C.A.</author><author>Belinsky, S.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Defining a gene promoter methylation signature in sputum for lung cancer risk assessment</title><secondary-title>Clinical Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>3387-3395</pages><volume>18</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3049</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: To evaluate the methylation state of 31 genes in sputum as biomarkers in an expanded nested, case-control study from the Colorado cohort, and to assess the replication of results from the most promising genes in an independent case-control study of asymptomatic patients with stage I lung cancer from New Mexico. Experimental Design: Cases and controls from Colorado and New Mexico were interrogated for methylation of up to 31 genes using nested, methylation-specific PCR. Individual genes and methylation indices were used to assess the association between methylation and lung cancer with logistic regression modeling. Results: Seventeen genes with ORs of 1.4 to 3.6 were identified and selected for replication in the New Mexico study. Overall, the direction of effects seen in New Mexico was similar to Colorado with the largest increase in case discrimination (ORs, 3.2-4.2) seen for the PAX5α, GATA5, and SULF2 genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves generated from seven-gene panels from Colorado and New Mexico studies showed prediction accuracy of 71% and 77%, respectively. A 22-fold increase in lung cancer risk was seen for a subset of New Mexico cases with five or more genes methylated. Sequence variants associated with lung cancer did not improve the accuracy of this gene methylation panel. Conclusions: These studies have identified and replicated a panel of methylated genes whose integration with other promising biomarkers could initially identify the highest risk smokers for computed tomographic screening for early detection of lung cancer. ©2012 AACR.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862572356&amp;doi=10.1158%2f1078-0432.CCR-11-3049&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c49ba42d4937097a8cccaf1ed18d573b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parker, G.</author><author>Fletcher, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 'real world' utility of a web-based bipolar disorder screening measure: A replication study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Affective Disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Affective Disorders</full-title></periodical><pages>276-283</pages><volume>150</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jad.2013.04.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background We previously reported high acceptance of the Mood Swings Questionnaire (MSQ) bipolar disorder screening measure, as well as improved outcomes for those completing the test, leading to this independent replication study. Methods Individuals accessing the web-based MSQ provided baseline and 3-month follow-up data assessing depression and hypo/manic severity, quality of life and overall functioning, while we evaluated any subsequent actions. A total of 670 participants scoring above MSQ cut-off but not previously diagnosed as having a bipolar disorder were studied, with three principal sample sub-sets derived: 141 who 'took no action', 394 who took action but did not receive a confirmed clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and 135 who took action and had a bipolar diagnosis confirmed by their health professional. Results As reported in the initial study, the MSQ was viewed as informative by participants. All three sample sub-sets improved on key study measures - with those receiving a confirmed bipolar diagnosis (and thus most likely to have management plans modified) reporting the greatest improvement. Limitations Web-based recruitment risked an unrepresentative sample of individuals with bipolar disorder; sample members may have been biased by high levels of cooperativeness; the MSQ's psychometric properties in community web-based samples remain unestablished. Conclusions Results were strikingly consistent with those quantified in the initial study. Findings - including high acceptance and a superior outcome for those who had a bipolar diagnosis clinically confirmed following a 'positive' screen - provide further support for the 'real world' utility of the MSQ screening measure for bipolar disorder. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84882927846&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jad.2013.04.006&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f8c0faf46c1fc5aaafa1d5cb9565b0fa</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yong, Y.G.</author><author>Gao, Q.Z.</author><author>Liu, Q.X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The influences of new paper surface efficiency on printing quality</title><secondary-title>Applied Mechanics and Materials</secondary-title></titles><pages>374-378</pages><volume>477-478</volume><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.477-478.374</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Paper surface efficiency (PSE), a paper property integrating gloss and absorbency, can be used to evaluate color reproduction after the interaction of paper and ink.

The hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) procedures seem to produce alterations of the immune status. Interest in immunosuppression has increased due to the poliomavirus BK (BKV) infection. Our study evaluated the prevalence of BKV infection in ESRD-RRT patients and viral replication on HD or PD. From 2006 to 2011 we selected 58 patients (34 males) in ESRD-RRT for inclusion in our study. BKV replication was evaluated by qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In ESRD-RRT patients, the prevalence of BKV replication on plasma was 21%. We identified two groups of patients according to the dialysis procedure: 36 patients on HD (HD group) and 22 on PD (PD group). BKV replication in the HD group was 33% (12 of 36) versus 0% (0 of 22) in the PD group. Different age, number of months on RRT, and preserved diuresis was observed in the HD versus PD groups. With our results we can speculate that BKV infection in ESRD-RRT patients is linked to factors involved in the uremia-related immune dysfunction but also to specific mechanisms related to the different RRTs. PD is an option that could be associated with a better transplant outcome for patients undergoing kidney transplantation. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866307442&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.transproceed.2012.06.021&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4b7ac09015136143ddea773db14bf554</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alonso-Perez, E.</author><author>Suarez-Gestal, M.</author><author>Calaza, M.</author><author>Ordi-Ros, J.</author><author>Balada, E.</author><author>Bijl, M.</author><author>Papasteriades, C.</author><author>Carreira, P.</author><author>Skopouli, F.N.</author><author>Witte, T.</author><author>Endreffy, E.</author><author>Marchini, M.</author><author>Migliaresi, S.</author><author>Sebastiani, G.D.</author><author>Santos, M.J.</author><author>Suarez, A.</author><author>Blanco, F.J.</author><author>Barizzone, N.</author><author>Pullmann, R.</author><author>Ruzickova, S.</author><author>Lauwerys, B.R.</author><author>Gomez-Reino, J.J.</author><author>Gonzalez, A.</author><author>Liz, M.</author><author>Schmidt, R.E.</author><author>Kappou-Rigatou, I.</author><author>Scorza, R.</author><author>Kovacs, A.</author><author>Balada, E.</author><author>Kallenberg, C.G.</author><author>Vinagre, F.</author><author>Dostal, C.</author><author>Mavromati, M.</author><author>D'Alfonso, S.</author><author>Gutierrez, C.</author><author>Rego, I.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Further Evidence of Subphenotype Association with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Susceptibility Loci: A European Cases Only Study</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0045356</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) shows a spectrum of clinical manifestations that complicate its diagnosis, treatment and research. This variability is likely related with environmental exposures and genetic factors among which known SLE susceptibility loci are prime candidates. The first published analyses seem to indicate that this is the case for some of them, but results are still inconclusive and we aimed to further explore this question. Methods: European SLE patients, 1444, recruited at 17 centres from 10 countries were analyzed. Genotypes for 26 SLE associated SNPs were compared between patients with and without each of 11 clinical features: ten of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria (except ANAs) and age of disease onset. These analyses were adjusted for centre of recruitment, top ancestry informative markers, gender and time of follow-up. Overlap of samples with previous studies was excluded for assessing replication. Results: There were three new associations: the SNPs in XKR6 and in FAM167A-BLK were associated with lupus nephritis (OR = 0.76 and 1.30, Pcorr = 0.007 and 0.03, respectively) and the SNP of MECP2, which is in chromosome X, with earlier age of disease onset in men. The previously reported association of STAT4 with early age of disease onset was replicated. Some other results were suggestive of the presence of additional associations. Together, the association signals provided support to some previous findings and to the characterization of lupus nephritis, autoantibodies and age of disease onset as the clinical features more associated with SLE loci. Conclusion: Some of the SLE loci shape the disease phenotype in addition to increase susceptibility to SLE. This influence is more prominent for some clinical features than for others. However, results are only partially consistent between studies and subphenotype specific GWAS are needed to unravel their genetic component. © 2012 Alonso-Perez et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866856647&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0045356&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7bbb6ba9d04f748629a125100a609293</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hamdeni, C.</author><author>Hamrouni, T.</author><author>Ben Charrada, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>New evaluation criterion of file replicas placement for replication strategies in data grids</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - 2014 9th International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing, 3PGCIC 2014</secondary-title></titles><pages>1-8</pages><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/3PGCIC.2014.29</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Data grids provide distributed resources for dealing with large scale applications generating huge volume of data that require to be efficiently managed, shared and analyzed. Data replication is a useful technique to solve these tasks since it allows minimizing data access time through creating many replicas and storing them in appropriate locations. Several replication strategies have been proposed in the literature. The main idea of our work is to propose a new aspect of the evaluation of replication strategies which is the quality assessment of replicas placement in the data grid. In this paper, we prove the influence of the distribution of replicas through sites on the evaluation results. We then show the importance of evaluating the quality of the replicas distribution in data grids. © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937551505&amp;doi=10.1109%2f3PGCIC.2014.29&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a1cb39c188604ed7cf5fa68d26cdeaa3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wright, T.S.</author><author>Wolery, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Roadside Instruction in Teaching Youth With Visual Impairments Street Crossings</title><secondary-title>Journal of Special Education</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Special Education</full-title></periodical><pages>46-58</pages><volume>48</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0022466912453770</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A single-participant multiple probe design across participants was used to evaluate the effectiveness of verbal rehearsal and graduated guidance to teach youth who were blind how to cross the street.

Distinction between healthy controls and diseased subjects data using RS fMRI is more useful in light of the fact that certain patients suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders may be unable to perform the tasks specified for acquisition. Specifically the neurologic disorder that we consider is ET for the reason that fMRI of this disorder is least explored and hence, functionally affected regions of this disease is not clearly known. Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) feature for healthy controls and ET patients was extracted as a mapping to brain function during resting state. One sample t-test was performed for both normal and patient data and regions with significant ReHo values were procured for both the data. The t-test maps respective to the two data groups, consisting of clusters with significant ReHo values, were used as masks respectively on ReHo maps of each of the groups. These masked ReHo maps were used as features as input to a linear classifier. The performance of the proposed scheme for classification of Healthy controls and ET was evaluated and the resulting generalization rate of the classifier was 100% for a dataset consisting of 11 samples in both the groups. The performance of the proposed masking technique remains to be evaluated with a dataset consisting of a large number of samples for ET and Healthy controls. © 2014 SPIE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902095852&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.2043952&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e9e56d08a7cc8c795dae88d0f6abe6bd</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>González-Barahona, J.M.</author><author>Robles, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the reproducibility of empirical software engineering studies based on data retrieved from development repositories</title><secondary-title>Empirical Software Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Empirical Software Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>75-89</pages><volume>17</volume><number>1-2</number><issue>1-2</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10664-011-9181-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Among empirical software engineering studies, those based on data retrieved from development repositories (such as those of source code management, issue tracking or communication systems) are specially suitable for reproduction. However their reproducibility status can vary a lot, from easy to almost impossible to reproduce. This paper explores which elements can be considered to characterize the reproducibility of a study in this area, and how they can be analyzed to better understand the type of reproduction studies they enable or obstruct. One of the main results of this exploration is the need of a systematic approach to asses the reproducibility of a study, due to the complexity of the processes usually involved, and the many details to be taken into account. To address this need, a methodology for assessing the reproducibility of studies is also presented and discussed, as a tool to help to raise awareness about research reproducibility in this field. The application of the methodology in practice has shown how, even for papers aimed to be reproducible, a systematic analysis raises important aspects that render reproduction difficult or impossible. We also show how, by identifying elements and attributes related to reproducibility, it can be better understood which kind of reproduction can be done for a specific study, given the description of datasets, methodologies and parameters it uses. © 2011 The Author(s).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857372534&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10664-011-9181-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8e17569d2a9e6701a6218a68767fd88e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heller, R.</author><author>Yekutiel, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replicability analysis for genome-wide association studies</title><secondary-title>Annals of Applied Statistics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Applied Statistics</full-title></periodical><pages>481-498</pages><volume>8</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1214/13-AOAS697</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The paramount importance of replicating associations is well recognized in the genome-wide associaton (GWA) research community, yet methods for assessing replicability of associations are scarce. Published GWA studies often combine separately the results of primary studies and of the follow-up studies. Informally, reporting the two separate meta-analyses, that of the primary studies and follow-up studies, gives a sense of the replicability of the results. We suggest a formal empirical Bayes approach for discovering whether results have been replicated across studies, in which we estimate the optimal rejection region for discovering replicated results. We demonstrate, using realistic simulations, that the average false discovery proportion of our method remains small. We apply our method to six type two diabetes (T2D) GWA studies. Out of 803 SNPs discovered to be associated with T2D using a typical meta-analysis, we discovered 219 SNPs with replicated associations with T2D. We recommend complementing a meta-analysis with a replicability analysis for GWA studies. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2014.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898039973&amp;doi=10.1214%2f13-AOAS697&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f9ed74238195d38926303182c6f81b6f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, I.J.</author><author>Kim, B.</author><author>Hwang, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An approach for the uncertainty evaluation of the overall result from replications of measurement: Separately combining individual uncertainty components according to their 'systematic' and 'random' effects</title><secondary-title>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society</full-title></periodical><pages>1057-1060</pages><volume>35</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5012/bkcs.2014.35.4.1057</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In our previous articles, an approach has been proposed for the evaluation of the uncertainty of overall result from multiple measurements. In the approach, uncertainty sources were classified into two groups: the first including those giving same 'systematic' effect on each individual measurement and the second including the others giving 'random' effect on each individual measurement and causing a variation among individual measurement results. The arithmetic mean of the replicated measurements is usually assigned as the value for the overall result. Uncertainty of the overall result is determined by separately evaluating and combining an overall uncertainty from sources of the 'systematic' effect and another overall uncertainty from sources of the 'random' effect. This conceptual approach has been widely adopted in chemical metrology society. In this study, further logical proof with more detailed mathematical expressions is provided on the approach.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898659366&amp;doi=10.5012%2fbkcs.2014.35.4.1057&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3fd122f19dc5522ff9ed8b6d886b9f06</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>da Silva, A.P.</author><author>Lopes, J.F.</author><author>de Paula, V.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RNA interference inhibits herpes simplex virus type 1 isolated from saliva samples and mucocutaneous lesions</title><secondary-title>Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>441-444</pages><volume>18</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bjid.2014.01.011</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of RNA interference to inhibit herpes simplex virus type-1 replication in vitro. For herpes simplex virus type-1 gene silencing, three different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the herpes simplex virus type-1 UL39 gene (sequence si-UL 39-1, si-UL 39-2, and si-UL 39-3) were used, which encode the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, an essential enzyme for DNA synthesis. Herpes simplex virus type-1 was isolated from saliva samples and mucocutaneous lesions from infected patients. All mucocutaneous lesions' samples were positive for herpes simplex virus type-1 by real-time PCR and by virus isolation; all herpes simplex virus type-1 from saliva samples were positive by real-time PCR and 50% were positive by virus isolation. The levels of herpes simplex virus type-1 DNA remaining after siRNA treatment were assessed by real-time PCR, whose results demonstrated that the effect of siRNAs on gene expression depends on siRNA concentration. The three siRNA sequences used were able to inhibit viral replication, assessed by real-time PCR and plaque assays and among them, the sequence si-UL 39-1 was the most effective. This sequence inhibited 99% of herpes simplex virus type-1 replication. The results demonstrate that silencing herpes simplex virus type-1 UL39 expression by siRNAs effectively inhibits herpes simplex virus type-1 replication, suggesting that siRNA based antiviral strategy may be a potential therapeutic alternative. © 2014.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904037080&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.bjid.2014.01.011&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0422e48fc8eb3c1e8d1c06cb5fdc8387</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sakofsky, C.J.</author><author>Grogan, D.W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endogenous mutagenesis in recombinant Sulfolobus plasmids</title><secondary-title>Journal of Bacteriology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Bacteriology</full-title></periodical><pages>2776-2785</pages><volume>195</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JB.00223-13</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Low rates of replication errors in chromosomal genes of Sulfolobus spp. demonstrate that these extreme thermoacidophiles can maintain genome integrity in environments with high temperature and low pH. In contrast to this genetic stability, we observed unusually frequent mutation of the β-D-glycosidase gene (lacS) of a shuttle plasmid (pJlacS) propagated in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. The resulting Lac- mutants also grew faster than the Lac Lac+ parent, thereby amplifying the impact of the frequent lacS mutations on the population. We developed a mutant accumulation assay and corrections for the effects of copy number and differential growth for this system; the resulting measurements and calculations yielded a corrected rate of 5.1×10-4 mutational events at the lacS gene per plasmid replication. Analysis of independent lacS mutants revealed three types of mutations: (i) G.Cto- A.T transitions, (ii) slipped-strand events, and (iii) deletions. These mutations were frequent in plasmid-borne lacS expressed at a high level but not in single-copy lacS in the chromosome or at lower levels of expression in a plasmid. Substitution mutations arose at only two of 12 potential priming sites of the DNA primase of the pRN1 replicon, but nearly all these mutations created nonsense (chain termination) codons. The spontaneous mutation rate of plasmid-borne lacS was 175-fold higher under high-expression than under low-expression conditions. The results suggest that important DNA repair or replication fidelity functions are impaired or overwhelmed in pJlacS, with results analogous to those of the "transcription-associated mutagenesis" seen in bacteria and eukaryotes. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879997238&amp;doi=10.1128%2fJB.00223-13&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=54e6818222869c30412b1175a433585f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guang, H.-M.</author><author>Wang, H.-X.</author><author>Wang, Q.-L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Introduction of EMA guideline for non-clinical testing of pediatric drugs in juvenile animals</title><secondary-title>Chinese Journal of New Drugs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese Journal of New Drugs</full-title></periodical><pages>2862-2864+2873</pages><volume>22</volume><number>24</number><issue>24</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>This document introduces the EMA guideline on non-clinical safety evaluation of medicinal products for pediatric use, providing the needs and roles of juvenile animal tests.

Objective: To investigate the impact of established MS genetic risk variants on MS phenotypes, in well-characterized MS cohorts. Methods: Norwegian MS patients (n = 639) and healthy controls (n = 530) were successfully genotyped for 61 established MS-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Data including and excluding Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) markers were summed to a MS Genetic Burden (MSGB) score. Study replication was performed in a cohort of white American MS patients (n = 1997) and controls (n = 708). Results: The total human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and the non-HLA MSGB scores were significantly higher in MS patients than in controls, in both cohorts (P 10 -22). MS patients, with and without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands (OCBs), had a higher MSGB score than the controls; the OCB-positive patients had a slightly higher MSGB than the OCB-negative patients. An early age at symptom onset (AAO) also correlated with a higher MSGB score, in both cohorts. Conclusion: The MSGB score was associated with specific clinical MS characteristics, such as OCBs and AAO. This study underlines the need for well-characterized, large cohorts of MS patients, and the usefulness of summarizing multiple genetic risk factors of modest effect size in genotype-phenotype analyses.© The Author(s) 2013.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899048957&amp;doi=10.1177%2f1352458513506503&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=aafe06b81b797f8aef59341938734a92</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, L.</author><author>Guilbert, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quality assessment in river network generalisation by preserving the drainage pattern</title><secondary-title>International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives</secondary-title></titles><pages>81-86</pages><volume>40</volume><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The drainage pattern of a river network is the arrangement in which a stream erodes the channels of its network of tributaries. It can reflect the geographical characteristics of a river network to a certain extent, because it depends on the topography and geology of the land. Whether in cartography or GIS, hydrography is one of the most important feature classes to generalise in order to produce representations at various levels of detail. Cartographic generalisation is an intricate process whereby information is selected and represented on a map at a certain scale, not necessarily preserving all geographical or other cartographic details. There are many methods for river network generalisation, but the generalized results are always inspected by expert cartographers visually. This paper proposes a method that evaluates the quality of a river network generalisation by assessing if drainage patterns are preserved. This method provides a quantitative value that estimates the membership of a river network in different drainage patterns. A set of geometric indicators describing each pattern are presented and the membership of a network is defined based on fuzzy logic. For each pattern, the fuzzy set membership is given by a defined IF-THEN rule composed of several indicators and logical operators. Assessing the quality of a generalisation is done by comparing and analysing the value before and after the network generalisation. This assessment method is tested with several river network generalisation methods on different sets of networks and results are analysed and discussed.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929087180&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=179ec064df532c3fe099afdc82be5f77</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lucas, J.W.</author><author>Morrell, K.</author><author>Posard, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Considerations on the 'Replication Problem' in Sociology</title><secondary-title>American Sociologist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Sociologist</full-title></periodical><pages>217-232</pages><volume>44</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12108-013-9176-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We re-examine the so-called "replication problem" in sociology-a scarcity of published studies dedicated to reproducing findings from prior research. We do this in part by considering the larger epistemological traditions of the natural sciences and humanities. We make three primary arguments: that (1) replication studies are more prevalent than is commonly perceived, (2) calls for and discussions of replication do not attend enough to issues of theory, and (3) we should reconsider as a discipline how we evaluate replications. In developing this third argument, we draw on the concept of episteme, discussing two epistemes that concurrently exist in sociology: the scientific project and the aesthetic object. The former overlaps with approaches to knowledge growth in the natural sciences, the latter with the humanities. We propose that sociology is situated between these extremes, presenting unique challenges for replication research. In particular, nuanced considerations of replications in sociology foreclose any simplistic accounts of a replication problem in the discipline. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878476127&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs12108-013-9176-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=cbf8acd8a58a9b1ae08cf8ba173a11e5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Byford, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The validity and responsiveness of the EQ-5D measure of health-related quality of life in an adolescent population with persistent major depression</title><secondary-title>Journal of Mental Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Mental Health</full-title></periodical><pages>101-110</pages><volume>22</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3109/09638237.2013.779366</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background Despite a preference for economic evaluations to measure outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years, generic measures of outcome are rarely used in mental health research involving young people.Aims To explore the validity and responsiveness of the EQ-5D measure of health-related quality of life in adolescents with major depression.Method Data came from a clinical trial involving adolescents with persistent major depression (n = 199). Construct validity was tested using socio-demographic constructs and baseline clinical outcome scores. To assess convergent validity, correlation between EQ-5D and clinical outcome scores was tested. To assess responsiveness, the mean change in EQ-5D scores of participants categorised as improved versus not improved on clinical outcome measures was tested.Results Significant differences in mean EQ-5D score were found for co-morbidity and three of four severity measures but not gender, age, treatment history or suicide attempts. Mean EQ-5D scores were significantly correlated with all clinical outcome measures, although relationships were moderate or weak. A change in mean EQ-5D score was significantly related to clinical assessments of improvement on all outcome measures.Conclusions Results provide initial evidence to support the relevance of the EQ-5D in adolescents with major depression, but this evidence is weak.

The Ca concentration in bronchial epithelial cells is an important factor for bronchoconstriction. Human annexin A4 (ANXA4) is predominantly expressed in the secretory epithelia in the lung, stomach, intestine, and kidney. Furthermore, translocation and induction of ANXA4 have been observed in human Ca-depleted neutrophils. To investigate the association between annexin A4 polymorphisms and the risk of AERD, we have genotyped 21 variants from 102 AERD subjects and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) controls. Logistic analyses controlling for sex, smoking status, and atopy as covariates were performed to estimate the association between the annexin A4 polymorphisms and AERD. Among these variants, 8 polymorphisms (rs2168116, rs4853017, rs6546547, rs13428251, rs7577864, rs7559354, rs7588022, and rs3816491) and 2 haplotypes (ANXA4-ht3 and ANXA4-ht5) were significantly associated with the risk of AERD. One common polymorphism in intron 11, rs3816491, showed the strongest association signal with susceptibility to aspirin-AERD even after multiple testing corrections (OR=0.57; 95% confidence interval 0.40-0.83; P=0.003; P=0.045 in the codominant model). Although further functional evaluations of replication studies in larger cohorts are required, our findings suggest that the annexin A4 could have susceptibility for AERD.

Experiments were established in a naturally infested onion field during two consecutive years (2012–2013). Nematode population development was followed at the beginning and end of the experiment. The reproduction rate was also calculated. Onion yield and the representative average diameter and length of the onion cultivar bulbs were determined. Yield parameters of six onion varieties were compared on nematicide-treated and untreated control plots in the experiments. Nematode populations significantly decreased in the nematicide-treated plots at the beginning of the experiment during both growing seasons. The average population density of D. dipsaci was 104 individuals/100 g dry soil in the first year and 68 individuals/100 g dry soil in the second year of the experiment. The initial and final nematode populations were significantly positively correlated with Betapanko, Pan88, and Local variety1 cultivars, whereas they were negatively correlated with the Valenciana cultivar during the first year. This suggests that Betapanko, Pan88, and Local variety1 were susceptible to D. dipsaci, whereas the Valenciana cultivar could have some resistance. The overall reproduction rate of D. dipsaci was negatively correlated with initial population density and was primarily &lt;1, which presumably represented a downward trend in nematode reproduction due to environmental conditions at the end of the experiment in September. Betapanko and Pan88 were susceptible varieties, and stem and bulb nematode caused yield losses of up to 12.93% and 15.33%, respectively; these varieties were considered intolerant. The yield of Local variety1 was positively related with initial nematode population density and it was categorized as tolerant to D. dipsaci. © TÜBİTAK.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928985564&amp;doi=10.3906%2ftar-1404-133&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8febf5ea3ae3839235c2678f3975de20</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pomaville, F.M.</author><author>Kladopoulos, C.N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of behavioral speech therapy on speech sound production with adults who have cochlear implants</title><secondary-title>Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research</full-title></periodical><pages>531-541</pages><volume>56</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1044/1092-4388(2012/12-0017)</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: In this study, the authors examined the treatment efficacy of a behavioral speech therapy protocol for adult cochlear implant recipients. Method: The authors used a multiple-baseline, across-behaviors and -participants design to examine the effectiveness of a therapy program based on behavioral principles and methods to improve the production of target speech sounds in 3 adults with cochlear implants. The authors included probe items in a baseline protocol to assess generalization of target speech sounds to untrained exemplars. Pretest and posttest scores from the Arizona Articulation Proficiency Scale, Third Revision (Arizona-3; Fudala, 2000) and measurement of speech errors during spontaneous speech were compared, providing additional measures of target behavior generalization. Results: The results of this study provided preliminary evidence supporting the overall effectiveness and efficiency of a behavioral speech therapy program in increasing percent correct speech sound production in adult cochlear implant recipients. The generalization of newly trained speech skills to untrained words and to spontaneous speech was demonstrated.

Generation of these parameters is of great importance in a manufacturing setting, where they can aid in the estimation of product quality, quantity, and fermentation time of the manufacturing process. Specifically, budding percentages can be used to estimate the reproduction rate of yeast populations, which directly correlates with metabolism of polysaccharides and bioethanol production, and can be monitored to maximize production of bioethanol during fermentation. The traditional method involves manual counting using a hemacytometer, but this is time-consuming and prone to human error. In this study, we developed a novel automated method for the quantification of yeast budding percentages using Cellometer image cytometry. The automated method utilizes a dual-fluorescent nucleic acid dye to specifically stain live cells for imaging analysis of unique morphological characteristics of budding yeast. In addition, cell cycle analysis is performed as an alternative method for budding analysis. We were able to show comparable yeast budding percentages between manual and automated counting, as well as cell cycle analysis. The automated image cytometry method is used to analyze and characterize corn mash samples directly from fermenters during standard fermentation. Since concentration, viability, and budding percentages can be obtained simultaneously, the automated method can be integrated into the fermentation quality assurance protocol, which may improve the quality and efficiency of beer and bioethanol production processes. © 2013 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878240315&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10295-013-1263-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=177bbe214c140c6e3a6d6cbc6726936d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soto, J.C.</author><author>Clavijo, M.J.</author><author>Filgueira, J.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Floral evaluation and reproduction capacity of Dianthus caryophyllus cultivars for a breeding program</title><secondary-title>Acta Horticulturae</secondary-title></titles><pages>429-432</pages><volume>1000</volume><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.17660/ActaHortic.2013.1000.59</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Carnation growers in the whole world, have to face the problem of decreasing revenues, due to the most important disease in this crop, the rot vascular disease. The most effective way to solve the problem is to find resistant carnation varieties, thus, this research presents the floral evaluation related to gynoecium and androecium and the reproduction capacity useful for breeding four carnation varieties, two of them resistant varieties and two cultivars, all of them obtained thought a breeding program. Direct and reciprocal crosses were made between all materials in order to establish in which crosses produced viable F1 seeds. As a result, the reproduction capacity of the six parents produced a total of 809 seeds from nine successful crosses. Also, the floral opening stage II to collect mature and viable pollen was established. It was found that 'Kaly', 'Candy' and 'UM503' were the best parent to receive pollen and 'M226' was the best pollen donator. On the other hand, 'Lady Green' was poor in both as donor and acceptor in order to yield viable carnation seeds.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883013691&amp;doi=10.17660%2fActaHortic.2013.1000.59&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=861964fb23df7e78c67c14450875d488</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martens, B.K.</author><author>Werder, C.S.</author><author>Hier, B.O.</author><author>Koenig, E.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fluency Training in Phoneme Blending: A Preliminary Study of Generalized Effects</title><secondary-title>Journal of Behavioral Education</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Behavioral Education</full-title></periodical><pages>16-36</pages><volume>22</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10864-012-9159-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We examined the generalized effects of training children to fluently blend phonemes of words containing target vowel teams on their reading of trained and untrained words in lists and passages.

A multiple probe design across vowel teams revealed generalized increases in oral reading accuracy for target words presented in both lists and passages for all 3 students on 2 vowel teams and for 1 student on all 3 vowel teams.

Successful replication attempts increase researchers' confidence in the presence of an effect, whereas failed replication attempts induce skepticism and doubt. However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attempt results in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes we propose a novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of 2 competing hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic and holds that the effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis that postulates a zero effect size, H0 :δ0. The 2nd hypothesis is that of the proponent and holds that the effect is consistent with the one found in the original study, an effect that can be quantified by a posterior distribution. Hence, the 2nd hypothesis-the replication hypothesis-is given by Hr :δ ~"posterior distribution from original study." The weighted-likelihood ratio between H0 and Hr quantifies the evidence that the data provide for replication success and failure. In addition to the new test, we present several other Bayesian tests that address different but related questions concerning a replication study. These tests pertain to the independent conclusions of the separate experiments, the difference in effect size between the original experiment and the replication attempt, and the overall conclusion based on the pooled results. Together, this suite of Bayesian tests allows a relatively complete formalization of the way in which the result of a replication attempt alters our knowledge of the phenomenon at hand. The use of all Bayesian replication tests is illustrated with 3 examples from the literature. For experiments analyzed using the t test, computation of the new replication test only requires the t values and the numbers of participants from the original study and the replication study. © 2014 American Psychological Association.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905094316&amp;doi=10.1037%2fa0036731&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=46748b16a53ed38ad23ac8fd10c2b8d7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Falcomata, T.S.</author><author>Wacker, D.P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Use of Strategies for Programming Generalization During Functional Communication Training: A Review of the Literature</title><secondary-title>Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities</full-title></periodical><pages>5-15</pages><volume>25</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10882-012-9311-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We conducted a review of the literature pertaining to Functional Communication Training (FCT) and the principles and tactics for programming generalization. Ten studies of FCT and generalization were identified, analyzed, and summarized using the framework provided by Stokes and Osnes (Behavior Therapist 20:337-355, 1989) that detailed principles and tactics programming generalization. In addition to the tactic of recruiting natural consequences which is inherent to FCT, several studies evaluated additional strategies for programming generalization during FCT including modification of maladaptive consequences, reinforcement of occurrences of generalization, training sufficient stimulus exemplars, programming common physical stimuli, and programming common social stimuli. The results of these studies suggest that a) FCT and the tactic of recruiting natural consequences is sometimes sufficient to produce generalization but not in every case, and b) generalization of the treatment effects of FCT can be enhanced through the use of specific tactics for programming generalization. Overall, the results of this review suggest that a relatively small number of studies of FCT have systematically evaluated generalization. Thus, future research should continue to evaluate specific strategies for programming generalization with FCT. This includes combining procedures such as recruiting natural consequences with other strategies outlined by Stokes and Osnes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84873736635&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10882-012-9311-3&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3749956ba7c0fdbf88748ea6b27de521</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, M.</author><author>Zhang, X.</author><author>Han, Z.</author><author>Chen, X.</author><author>Yang, L.</author><author>Sheng, Y.</author><author>Wen, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Construction of a novel oncolytic adenoviral vector and its biological characteristics</title><secondary-title>Oncology Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncology Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>798-804</pages><volume>29</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/or.2012.2140</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this study, we aimed to construct an effective and safe oncolytic adenoviral vector for cancer treatment with gene therapy. First, the promoter of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERTp), adenovirus early region 1a gene (E1A) and thymidine kinase gene of human herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1-TK) were amplified by using PCR from genomic DNA of 293A cells and wild-type HSV-1 (wHSV-1). These specially-prepared elements were inserted into an adenoviral shuttle vector in the opposite and the same directions of left inverted terminal repeat (L-ITR), respectively, to construct pENTR-E1A-IRES-TK-hTERTp (pEITH) and pENTR-hTERTp-E1A-IRES-TK (pHEIT). LR reaction between adenoviral shuttle vectors (pEITH and pHEIT) and the backbone vector DEST was carried out to establish adenoviral expression vectors pAd-E1A-IRES-TK-hTERTp (pAd-EITH) and pAd-hTERTp-E1A-IRES-TK (pAd-HEIT). Recombinant adenovirus Ad-EITH and Ad-HEIT were produced by transfecting 293A cells and purified for the subsequent studies of titer measurement, replication capability with and without acyclovir (ACV) and antitumor ability with and without ganciclovir (GCV) to evaluate the biological characteristics. Adenoviral shuttle vectors pEITH and pHEIT and expression vectors pAd-EITH and pAd-HEIT were successfully constructed, and recombinant adenoviruses Ad-EITH and Ad-HEIT with high titer were produced. The results of replication and cytotoxicity assays showed that Ad-EITH and Ad-HEIT replicated in the hTERTp (+) human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE and expressed the TK gene effectively leading to the death of tumor cells. In addition, there were still some Ad-HEIT particles replicating in the hTERTp (-) human osteosarcoma U-2OS cells and human lung HFL-1 fibroblasts compared to Ad-EITH which was hardly able to replicate in U-2OS and HFL-1 cells. In addition, we also observed an interesting phenomenon, that the replication of Ad-EITH could be inhibited by antiviral drug ACV on account of the expression of HSV-1-TK gene making Ad-EITH sensitive to ACV. In conclusion, a novel oncolytic adenoviral vector Ad-EITH was produced which can be used for cancer-specific and efficient viral replication, and its safety is potentially improved as replication can be inhibited by ACV in vitro.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872792429&amp;doi=10.3892%2for.2012.2140&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=afce68ca2891d336a5a78e31de29e11f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, J.</author><author>Bondalapati, K.</author><author>Glover, K.</author><author>Berzonsky, W.</author><author>Jenkins, J.N.</author><author>McCarty, J.C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic analysis without replications: Model evaluation and application in spring wheat</title><secondary-title>Euphytica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Euphytica</full-title></periodical><pages>447-458</pages><volume>190</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10681-012-0835-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genetic data collected from various plant breeding and genetic studies may not be replicated in field designs although field variation is always present. In this study, we addressed this problem using spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) trial data collected from two locations. There were no intralocation replications and an extended additive-dominance (AD) model was used to account for field variation. We numerically evaluated the data from simulations and estimated the variance components. For demonstration purposes we also analyzed three agronomic traits from the actual spring wheat data set. Results showed that these data could be effectively analyzed using an extended AD model, which was more comparable to a conventional AD model. Actual data analysis revealed that grain yield was significantly influenced by systematic field variation. Additive effects were significant for all traits and dominance effects were significant for plant height and time-to-flowering. Genetic effects were predicted and used to demonstrate that most spring wheat lines developed by the South Dakota State University breeding program (SD lines) exhibited good general combining ability effects for yield improvement. Thus, this study provides a general framework to appropriately analyze data in situations where field crop data are collected from non-replicated designs. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875429131&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10681-012-0835-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4f8941e856764b1195ed580e0146cf7e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rose, N.</author><author>Hervé, S.</author><author>Eveno, E.</author><author>Barbier, N.</author><author>Eono, F.</author><author>Dorenlor, V.</author><author>Andraud, M.</author><author>Camsusou, C.</author><author>Madec, F.</author><author>Simon, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamics of influenza a virus infections in permanently infected pig farms: Evidence of recurrent infections, circulation of several swine influenza viruses and reassortment events</title><secondary-title>Veterinary Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary Research</full-title></periodical><volume>44</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1297-9716-44-72</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Concomitant infections by different influenza A virus subtypes within pig farms increase the risk of new reassortant virus emergence. The aims of this study were to characterize the epidemiology of recurrent swine influenza virus infections and identify their main determinants. A follow-up study was carried out in 3 selected farms known to be affected by repeated influenza infections. Three batches of pigs were followed within each farm from birth to slaughter through a representative sample of 40 piglets per batch. Piglets were monitored individually on a monthly basis for serology and clinical parameters. When a flu outbreak occurred, daily virological and clinical investigations were carried out for two weeks. Influenza outbreaks, confirmed by influenza A virus detection, were reported at least once in each batch. These outbreaks occurred at a constant age within farms and were correlated with an increased frequency of sneezing and coughing fits. H1N1 and H1N2 viruses from European enzootic subtypes and reassortants between viruses from these lineages were consecutively and sometimes simultaneously identified depending on the batch, suggesting virus co-circulations at the farm, batch and sometimes individual levels. The estimated reproduction ratio R of influenza outbreaks ranged between 2.5 [1.9-2.9] and 6.9 [4.1-10.5] according to the age at infection-time and serological status of infected piglets. Duration of shedding was influenced by the age at infection time, the serological status of the dam and mingling practices. An impaired humoral response was identified in piglets infected at a time when they still presented maternally-derived antibodies. © 2013 Rose et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883277308&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1297-9716-44-72&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2d725f80570f2ae18416ad394e8e941f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wojciechowski, P.T.</author><author>Kobus, T.</author><author>Kokocinski, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Model-driven comparison of state-machine-based and deferred-update replication schemes</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems</secondary-title></titles><pages>101-110</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/SRDS.2012.44</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper, we analyze and experimentally compare state-machine-based and deferred-update (or transactional) replication, both relying on atomic broadcast. We define a model that describes the upper and lower bounds on the execution of concurrent requests by a service replicated using either scheme. The model is parametrized by the degree of parallelism in either scheme, the number of processor cores, and the type of requests. We analytically compared both schemes and a non-replicated service, considering a bcast- and request-execution-dominant workloads. To evaluate transactional replication experimentally, we developed Paxos STM - -a novel fault-tolerant distributed software transactional memory with programming constructs for transaction creation, abort, and retry. For state-machine-based replication, we used JPaxos. Both systems share the same implementat ion of atomic broadcast based on the Paxos algorithm. We present the results of performance evaluation of both replication schemes, and a non-replicated (thus prone to failures) service, considering various workloads. The key result of our theoretical and experimental work is that neither system is superior in all cases.

A previous study using cultured keratinocytes revealed that genome replication of one HPV type is inhibited by co-existence of the genome of another HPV type, suggesting that replication interference occurs between different HPV types when co-infected; however, molecular mechanisms underlying inter-type replication interference have not been fully explored. Methods. Replication interference between two most prevalent HPV types, HPV16 and HPV18, was examined in HPV-negative C33A cervical carcinoma cells co-transfected with genomes of HPV16 and HPV18 together with expression plasmids for E1/E2 of both types. Levels of HPV16/18 genome replication were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Physical interaction between HPV16/18 E1s was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation assays in the cell lysates. Results: The replication of HPV16 and HPV18 genomes was suppressed by co-expression of E1/E2 of heterologous types. The interference was mediated by the heterologous E1, but not E2. The oligomerization domain of HPV16 E1 was essential for HPV18 replication inhibition, whereas the helicase domain was dispensable. HPV16 E1 co-precipitated with HPV18 E1 in the cell lysates, and an HPV16 E1 mutant Y379A, which bound to HPV18 E1 less efficiently, failed to inhibit HPV18 replication. Conclusions: Co-infection of a single cell with both HPV16 and HPV18 results in replication interference between them, and physical interaction between the heterologous E1s is responsible for the interference. Heterooligomers composed of HPV16/18 E1s may lack the ability to support HPV genome replication. © 2014 Mori et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892769746&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1743-422X-11-11&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f79de9738ae9f08675b8abafdfe7a4a4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Okasha, T.A.</author><author>El Sheikh, M.M.</author><author>El Missiry, A.A.</author><author>El Missiry, M.A.</author><author>El Serafi, D.</author><author>El Kholy, S.</author><author>Abdel Aziz, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cognitive functions in euthymic Egyptian patients with bipolar disorder: Are they different from healthy controls?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Affective Disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Affective Disorders</full-title></periodical><pages>14-21</pages><volume>166</volume><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jad.2014.04.051</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background There is marked interest to research neurocognitive functions in bipolar disorder during euthymia. Consequently we aimed to study cognitive functions in euthymic bipolar patients and factors affecting them. Methods It is a cross sectional case-control study of 60 euthymic bipolar patients and 30 matched healthy controls. They were subjected to: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders, (SCID-I) to ascertain clinical diagnosis, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) to validate euthymia. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) for general intellectual abilities, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) for memory, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) for executive functions, Continuous Performance Test (CPT) for attention and impulsivity, and an information sheet gathering patient data. Results Bipolar patients had statistically significant lower mean IQ scores in all WAIS subscales (p=0.000), significantly lower memory abilities especially digit span and visual memory, higher impulsivity and inattention (p=0.000) but no significant difference in response time by CPT. They displayed significantly lower executive performance on WCST. Patients' years of education correlated positively with IQ. Hospital admission, number, type of episodes and total number of episodes affected memory functions. Hospital admission and number of hypomanic episodes correlated with attention and impulsivity. Previous hospitalization correlated with executive functions. Conclusions Euthymic bipolar patients exhibit cognitive deficits, which correlated with clinical variables as number, type of episodes and previous hospitalization, this knowledge could help minimize cognitive impairments for future patients. Limitations The small sample size, cross sectional design and lack of premorbid cognitive assessment limit generalization of findings. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901346249&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jad.2014.04.051&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=95eea28d8d16595b3e9af9a3b8065765</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Žaltauskaite, J.</author><author>Miškelyte, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antimicrobial personal care products effects in the terrestrial environment</title><secondary-title>Fresenius Environmental Bulletin</secondary-title></titles><pages>2859-2864</pages><volume>23</volume><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Triclosan (TCS) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antifungal agent and it is a common constituent of household and personal care products. TCS widespread use has resulted in its introduction into environment and has raised concerns regarding possible adverse effects on terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Earthworm Eisenia fetida was chosen as representative organism to evaluate the impact of TCS on soil organisms. Adult E. fetida were exposed to 10-750 mg/kg of triclosan for 8 weeks. The impact on survival, growth and reproduction was evaluated. TCS had low acute toxicity to adults, though subchronic exposure severely affected the survival of earthworms (8-week LC50 252.88±86.84 mg kg-1). None of the tested TCS concentrations evoked earthworm weight loss during the experiment, but the earthworms treated with TCS grew slower and this resulted in lower weight at the end of the experiment. Reproduction was shown to be the most susceptible endpoint to TCS exposure. Cocoon production in the soils spiked with 500-750 mg kg-1 was reduced by 90% in comparison with control group.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927726553&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=be3e0d41bac29b7c45c1a615b0268e36</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olm, C.</author><author>Zsély, I.G.</author><author>Pálvölgyi, R.</author><author>Varga, T.</author><author>Nagy, T.</author><author>Curran, H.J.</author><author>Turányi, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of the performance of several recent hydrogen combustion mechanisms</title><secondary-title>Combustion and Flame</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Combustion and Flame</full-title></periodical><pages>2219-2234</pages><volume>161</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.combustflame.2014.03.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A large set of experimental data was accumulated for hydrogen combustion: ignition measurements in shock tubes (770 data points in 53 datasets) and rapid compression machines (229/20), concentration-time profiles in flow reactors (389/17), outlet concentrations in jet-stirred reactors (152/9) and flame velocity measurements (631/73) covering wide ranges of temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio. The performance of 19 recently published hydrogen combustion mechanisms was tested against these experimental data, and the dependence of accuracy on the types of experiment and the experimental conditions was investigated. The best mechanism for the reproduction of ignition delay times and flame velocities is Kéromnès-2013, while jet-stirred reactor (JSR) experiments and flow reactor profiles are reproduced best by GRI3.0-1999 and Starik-2009, respectively. According to the reproduction of all experimental data, the Kéromnès-2013 mechanism is currently the best, but the mechanisms NUIG-NGM-2010, ÓConaire-2004, Konnov-2008 and Li-2007 have similarly good overall performances. Several clear trends were found when the performance of the best mechanisms was investigated in various categories of experimental data. Low-temperature ignition delay times measured in shock tubes (below 1000K) and in RCMs (below 960K) could not be well-predicted. The accuracy of the reproduction of an ignition delay time did not change significantly with pressure and equivalence ratio. Measured H2 and O2 concentrations in JSRs could be better reproduced than the corresponding H2O profiles. Large differences were found between the mechanisms in their capability to predict flow reactor data. The reproduction of the measured laminar flame velocities improved with increasing pressure and total diluent concentration, and with decreasing equivalence ratio. Reproduction of the flame velocities measured using the flame cone method, the outwardly propagating spherical flame method, the counterflow twin-flame technique, and the heat flux burner method improved in this order. Flame cone method data were especially poorly reproduced. The investigation of the correlation of the simulation results revealed similarities of mechanisms that were published by the same research groups. Also, simulation results calculated by the best-performing mechanisms are more strongly correlated with each other than those of the weakly performing ones, indicating a convergence of mechanism development. An analysis of sensitivity coefficients was carried out to identify reactions and ranges of conditions that require more attention in future development of hydrogen combustion models. The influence of poorly reproduced experiments on the overall performance was also investigated. © 2014 The Combustion Institute.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905491892&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2014.03.006&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8ece3852939b5ba6c0316519c56882de</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Solari, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying experimental incidents in software engineering replications</title><secondary-title>International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement</secondary-title></titles><pages>213-222</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ESEM.2013.26</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Empirical Software Engineering community is taking a growing interest in replicating experiments, but replications still pose a challenge for researchers. To be able to do better replications, we require detailed knowledge of what happens when a replication is performed. This article introduces a procedure for empirically evaluating replications designed to identify experimental incidents. The evaluation employs a qualitative method to analyze interviews with the principal investigator and other sources of information. We evaluated five replications of the same experiment run by different experimenters at different sites. We identified 49 incident types that occurred between 1 and 4 times across the evaluated replications. Although the replications were conducted within an experimentation network which was set up with collaborative instruments, we identified incidents in all the experimental activities. If experimenters know which incidents are likely to occur in replications, they will be able to focus on the identified problems and improve the replications that they perform. This report is a first step to create and improve experiment communication instruments such as laboratory packages. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893318797&amp;doi=10.1109%2fESEM.2013.26&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=29f55e22573db3bfda346c2584cc8869</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, L.</author><author>Chen, X.</author><author>Shi, Y.</author><author>Zhou, B.</author><author>Du, C.</author><author>Liu, Y.</author><author>Han, S.</author><author>Yin, J.</author><author>Peng, B.</author><author>He, X.</author><author>Liu, W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>miR-27a suppresses EV71 replication by directly targeting EGFR</title><secondary-title>Virus Genes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virus Genes</full-title></periodical><pages>373-382</pages><volume>49</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11262-014-1114-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a major causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease, has broken out several times and was accompanied by neurological disease. microRNAs, a class of small non-coding RNAs that are approximately 20 nucleotides long, play important roles in the regulation of various biological processes, including antiviral defense. However, the roles of miRNAs in EV71 replication and pathogenesis are not well understood. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-27a was significantly decreased in EV71-infected cells. Interestingly, the over-expression of miR-27a could inhibit EV71 replication, as measured by virus titration, qPCR, and Western blotting. We identified EGFR mRNA is a bona fide target of miR-27a by computational analysis and luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, miR-27a could decrease EGFR expression, as measured by qPCR and Western blotting. Moreover, the inhibition of EGFR expression by miR-27a decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, which facilitate EV71 replication. These results suggest that miR-27a may have antiviral activity against EV71 by inhibiting EGFR. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84911022509&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs11262-014-1114-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=df0d4b4866d25248e3e0634c687ebcda</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stier, A.</author><author>Reichert, S.</author><author>Massemin, S.</author><author>Bize, P.</author><author>Criscuolo, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Constraint and cost of oxidative stress on reproduction: Correlative evidence in laboratory mice and review of the literature</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Zoology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Zoology</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1742-9994-9-37</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: One central concept in evolutionary ecology is that current and residual reproductive values are negatively linked by the so-called cost of reproduction. Previous studies examining the nature of this cost suggested a possible involvement of oxidative stress resulting from the imbalance between pro- and anti-oxidant processes. Still, data remain conflictory probably because, although oxidative damage increases during reproduction, high systemic levels of oxidative stress might also constrain parental investment in reproduction. Here, we investigated variation in oxidative balance (i.e. oxidative damage and antioxidant defences) over the course of reproduction by comparing female laboratory mice rearing or not pups.Results: A significant increase in oxidative damage over time was only observed in females caring for offspring, whereas antioxidant defences increased over time regardless of reproductive status. Interestingly, oxidative damage measured prior to reproduction was negatively associated with litter size at birth (constraint), whereas damage measured after reproduction was positively related to litter size at weaning (cost).Conclusions: Globally, our correlative results and the review of literature describing the links between reproduction and oxidative stress underline the importance of timing/dynamics when studying and interpreting oxidative balance in relation to reproduction. Our study highlights the duality (constraint and cost) of oxidative stress in life-history trade-offs, thus supporting the theory that oxidative stress plays a key role in life-history evolution. © 2012 Stier et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84871525993&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1742-9994-9-37&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fad368cfabcf1af5fba04b3b07da216a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ferretti, A.C.</author><author>Joyce, G.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Kinetic properties of an RNA enzyme that undergoes self-sustained exponential amplification</title><secondary-title>Biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>1227-1235</pages><volume>52</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bi301646n</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A special class of biochemical reactions involves a set of enzymes that generate additional copies of themselves and transfer heritable information from parent to progeny molecules, thus providing the basis for genetics and Darwinian evolution. Such a process has been realized with a pair of self-replicating RNA enzymes that undergo exponential amplification at a constant temperature. Exponential growth requires that the rate of production of new enzymes be directly proportional to the existing concentration of enzymes, which is the case for this system and provides a doubling time of ∼20 min. However, the catalytic rate of the underlying enzymes is ∼100-fold faster than the observed rate of replication. As in biological replication, other aspects of the system limit the generation time, chiefly the propensity of the substrate molecules to form nonproductive complexes that limit their availability for replication. An analysis of this and other kinetic properties of the self-replicating RNA enzymes reveals how exponential amplification is achieved and how the rate of amplification might be increased. © 2013 American Chemical Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874037787&amp;doi=10.1021%2fbi301646n&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f74d6f599162cf69227a7707ef57b3ad</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thorp, E.B.</author><author>Larson, E.</author><author>Stepp, C.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combined auditory and vibrotactile feedback for human-machine-interface control</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>62-68</pages><volume>22</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2273177</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the addition of binary vibrotactile stimulation to continuous auditory feedback (vowel synthesis) for human-machine interface (HMI) control. Sixteen healthy participants controlled facial surface electromyography to achieve 2-D targets (vowels). Eight participants used only real-time auditory feedback to locate targets whereas the other eight participants were additionally alerted to having achieved targets with confirmatory vibrotactile stimulation at the index finger. All participants trained using their assigned feedback modality (auditory alone or combined auditory and vibrotactile) over three sessions on three days and completed a fourth session on the third day using novel targets to assess generalization. Analyses of variance performed on the 1) percentage of targets reached and 2) percentage of trial time at the target revealed a main effect for feedback modality: participants using combined auditory and vibrotactile feedback performed significantly better than those using auditory feedback alone. No effect was found for session or the interaction of feedback modality and session, indicating a successful generalization to novel targets but lack of improvement over training sessions. Future research is necessary to determine the cognitive cost associated with combined auditory and vibrotactile feedback during HMI control. © 2001-2011 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892384764&amp;doi=10.1109%2fTNSRE.2013.2273177&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=81e22296650146b4ab486ef93f894f7e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guertin, K.A.</author><author>Moore, S.C.</author><author>Sampson, J.N.</author><author>Huang, W.-Y.</author><author>Xiao, Q.</author><author>Stolzenberg-Solomon, R.Z.</author><author>Sinha, R.</author><author>Cross, A.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metabolomics in nutritional epidemiology: Identifying metabolites associated with diet and quantifying their potential to uncover diet-disease relations in populations</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</full-title></periodical><pages>208-217</pages><volume>100</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3945/ajcn.113.078758</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Metabolomics is an emerging field with the potential to advance nutritional epidemiology; however, it has not yet been applied to large cohort studies. Objectives: Our first aim was to identify metabolites that are biomarkers of usual dietary intake. Second, among serum metabolites correlated with diet, we evaluated metabolite reproducibility and required sample sizes to determine the potential for metabolomics in epidemiologic studies. Design: Baseline serum from 502 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was analyzed by using ultra-high- performance liquid-phase chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Usual intakes of 36 dietary groups were estimated by using a food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary biomarkers were identified by using partial Pearson's correlations with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between samples collected 1 y apart in a subset of 30 individuals were calculated to evaluate intraindividual metabolite variability. Results: We detected 412 known metabolites. Citrus, green vegetables, red meat, shellfish, fish, peanuts, rice, butter, coffee, beer, liquor, total alcohol, and multivitamins were each correlated with at least one metabolite (P &lt; 1.093. 10-6; r = -0.312 to 0.398); in total, 39 dietary biomarkers were identified. Some correlations (citrus intake with stachydrine) replicated previous studies; others, such as peanuts and tryptophan betaine, were novel findings. Other strong associations included coffee (with trigonelline-N-methylnicotinate and quinate) and alcohol (with ethyl glucuronide). Intraindividual variability in metabolite levels (1-y ICCs) ranged from 0.27 to 0.89. Large, but attainable, sample sizes are required to detect associations between metabolites and disease in epidemiologic studies, further emphasizing the usefulness of metabolomics in nutritional epidemiology. Conclusions: We identified dietary biomarkers by using metabolomics in an epidemiologic data set. Given the strength of the associations observed, we expect that some of these metabolites will be validated in future studies and later used as biomarkers in large cohorts to study diet-disease associations.

We tested the impact of combining bortezomib with oHSV for antitumor efficacy. Experimental Design: The synergistic interaction between oHSV and bortezomib was calculated using Chou-Talalay analysis. Viral replication was evaluated using plaque assay and immune fluorescence. Western blot assays were used to evaluate induction of estrogen receptor (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR). Inhibitors targeting Hsp90 were utilized to investigate the mechanism of cell killing. Antitumor efficacy in vivo was evaluated using subcutaneous and intracranial tumor xenografts of glioma and head and neck cancer. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and two-sided log-rank test. Results: Combination treatment with bortezomib and oHSV (34.5ENVE), displayed strong synergistic interaction in ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer, glioma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells. Bortezomib treatment induced ER stress, evident by strong induction of Grp78, CHOP, PERK, and IRE1α (Western blot analysis) and the UPR (induction of hsp40, 70, and 90). Bortezomib treatment of cells at both sublethal and lethal doses increased viral replication (P &lt; 0.001), but inhibition of Hsp90 ablated this response, reducing viral replication and synergistic cell killing. The combination of bortezomib and 34.5ENVE significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy in multiple different tumor models in vivo. Conclusions: The dramatic synergy of bortezomib and 34.5ENVE is mediated by bortezomib-induced UPR and warrants future clinical testing in patients. ©2014 AACR.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904390050&amp;doi=10.1158%2f1078-0432.CCR-14-0553&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=11942b32dd117cc54a3639d0da9562e5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Visscher, H.</author><author>Ross, C.J.D.</author><author>Rassekh, S.R.</author><author>Sandor, G.S.S.</author><author>Caron, H.N.</author><author>van Dalen, E.C.</author><author>Kremer, L.C.</author><author>van der Pal, H.J.</author><author>Rogers, P.C.</author><author>Rieder, M.J.</author><author>Carleton, B.C.</author><author>Hayden, M.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validation of variants in SLC28A3 and UGT1A6 as genetic markers predictive of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in children</title><secondary-title>Pediatric Blood and Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pediatric Blood and Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>1375-1381</pages><volume>60</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/pbc.24505</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The use of anthracyclines as effective antineoplastic drugs is limited by the occurrence of cardiotoxicity. Multiple genetic variants predictive of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT) in children were recently identified. The current study was aimed to assess replication of these findings in an independent cohort of children. Procedure: Twenty-three variants were tested for association with ACT in an independent cohort of 218 patients. Predictive models including genetic and clinical risk factors were constructed in the original cohort and assessed in the current replication cohort. Results: We confirmed the association of rs17863783 in UGT1A6 and ACT in the replication cohort (P=0.0062, odds ratio (OR) 7.98). Additional evidence for association of rs7853758 (P=0.058, OR 0.46) and rs885004 (P=0.058, OR 0.42) in SLC28A3 was found (combined P=1.6×10-5 and P=3.0×10-5, respectively). A previously constructed prediction model did not significantly improve risk prediction in the replication cohort over clinical factors alone. However, an improved prediction model constructed using replicated genetic variants as well as clinical factors discriminated significantly better between cases and controls than clinical factors alone in both original (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.68, P=0.0031) and replication cohort (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.69, P=0.060). Conclusions: We validated genetic variants in two genes predictive of ACT in an independent cohort. A prediction model combining replicated genetic variants as well as clinical risk factors might be able to identify high- and low-risk patients who could benefit from alternative treatment options. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879219119&amp;doi=10.1002%2fpbc.24505&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=88639779f6b110a8ef8e3bfdacee1339</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xing, P.</author><author>Wang, C.</author><author>Wang, L.</author><author>Wang, H.</author><author>Xing, Q.-T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The gene polymorphism of IL-1B and IL-1RN intron 2 and their relationships with the progression of HCV-related liver diseases</title><secondary-title>Chinese Journal of Microbiology and Immunology (China)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese Journal of Microbiology and Immunology (China)</full-title></periodical><pages>186-193</pages><volume>34</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-5101.2014.03.004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: To study the characteristics of IL-1B-31/-511 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in intron 2 of the IL-1ra gene (IL-1RN) in patients with HCV-related liver diseases. Methods: The concentration of IL-1β and IL-1ra in serum samples was measured by ELISA assay. The SNPs of IL-1B gene (-31C/T,-511C/T) from 310 cases with HCV infection and 324 unrelated healthy controls were determined by using gene chip analysis, and the results for some randomly selected specimens were compared with those by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. The VNTR polymorphism of IL-1RN intron 2 was analyzed by PCR-RFLP assay. The serum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), an indicator of hepatocellular injury, was detected by ROCHE cobas 8000 analyzer. HCV replication was measured by using specific fluorescence PCR. The genotypes of HCV were determined by direct nucleotide sequencing test. Results: Compared with control group, the serum level of both IL-1β [(22.6 ± 7.3) vs (13.7 ± 4.2)] pg/ml and IL-1ra [(286.30 ± 55.10) vs (185.55 ± 48.32)] pg/ml were significantly increased in patients with HCV infection (P &lt; 0.01). There were two predominant genotypes identified among 310 patients including HCV 1b (75.5%) and HCV 2a (22.3%). The serum level of IL-1β and IL-1ra in IL-1B-511T carriers from four groups including case group, mild and moderate Hepatitis C group, severe Hepatitis C, and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) group were significantly higher than those from IL-1B-511CC carriers and control group (P &lt; 0.05). The ratio of IL-1ra to IL-1β in all IL-1B-511T carriers with HCV infection were lower than those from healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05). IL-1B-511T carriers with HCV genotype 1b infection showed a higher serum level of IL-1β as compared with those with HCV genotype 1a infection (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with control group, they also showed an increase in IL-1ra level (P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the serum level of IL-1β among IL-1B-511CC carriers from each group (P &gt; 0.05). The frequency of IL-1B-511TT genotype (P &lt; 0.05, OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.10-2.18) and IL-1B-511T allele (P &lt; 0.05, OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.05-1.63) in patients with HCV infection were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. IL-1B-511C/T SNP showed a significant association with the outcomes of HCV infection (P &lt; 0.005). Compared with IL-1B-511CC and IL-1B-511CT, IL-1B-511TT was a major risk factor for mild and moderate Hepatitis C [OR =2.17 (1.48-3.19)], severe Hepatitis C [OR = 2.11(1.05-4.26)], cirrhosis [OR = 2.98 (1.77-4.99)] and HCC [4.33(2.16-8.67)]. IL-1B-511T allele was significantly associated with mild and moderate Hepatitis C [1.80(1.38-2.36)], severe Hepatitis C [1.80(1.08-3.01)], cirrhosis [2.62(1.76-3.89)] and HCC [3.49(1.96-6.23)]. The frequency of IL-1B-511T allele showed significant difference among each group (P &lt; 0.005). No association was found between any of the other polymorphisms and HCV infection. Conclusion: The serum level of IL-1β and IL-1ra were significantly associated with HCV infection. IL-1B-511T allele in patients with HCV infection up-regulated the serum level of IL-1β. IL-1B-511TT and IL-1B-511T allele were major risk factors for mild and moderate Hepatitis C, severe Hepatitis C, cirrhosis and HCC, but IL-1B-511CC/C had opposite effects.

Impaired discrimination between threat and safety is considered a hallmark of clinical anxiety. Here, we investigated the circuit-wide structural and functional mechanisms underlying vmPFC threat-safety assessment in humans. We tested patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 32, female) and healthy controls (n = 25, age-matched female) on a task that assessed the generalization of conditioned threat during fMRI scanning. The task consisted of seven rectangles of graded widths presented on a screen; only the midsize one was paired with mild electric shock [conditioned stimulus (CS)], while the others, safety cues, systematically varied in width by ±20, 40, and 60% [generalization stimuli (GS)] compared with the CS. We derived an index reflecting vmPFC functioning from the BOLD reactivity on a continuum of threat (CS) to safety (GS least similar to CS); patients with GAD showed less discrimination between threat and safety cues, compared with healthy controls (Greenberg et al., 2013b). Using structural, functional (i.e., resting-state), and diffusion MRI, we measured vmPFC thickness, vmPFC functional connectivity, and vmPFC structural connectivity within the corticolimbic systems. The results demonstrate that all three factors predict individual variability of vmPFC threat assessment in an independent fashion. Moreover, these neural features are also linked to GAD, most likely via an vmPFC fear generalization. Our results strongly suggest that vmPFC threat processing is closely associated with broader corticolimbic circuit anomalies, which may synergistically contribute to clinical anxiety. © 2014 the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896788738&amp;doi=10.1523%2fJNEUROSCI.3372-13.2014&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2531d27a40049bd4bbc8b9c7f38d6e65</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lissek, S.</author><author>Kaczkurkin, A.N.</author><author>Rabin, S.</author><author>Geraci, M.</author><author>Pine, D.S.</author><author>Grillon, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalized anxiety disorder is associated with overgeneralization of classically conditioned fear</title><secondary-title>Biological Psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biological Psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>909-915</pages><volume>75</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.07.025</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background Meta-analytic results of fear-conditioning studies in the anxiety disorders implicate generalization of conditioned fear to stimuli resembling the conditioned danger cue as one of the more robust conditioning markers of anxiety pathology. Due to the absence of conditioning studies assessing generalization in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), results of this meta-analysis do not reveal whether such generalization abnormalities also apply to GAD. The current study fills this gap by behaviorally and psychophysiologically assessing levels of conditioned fear generalization across adults with and without GAD. Methods Twenty-two patients with a DSM-IV-Text Revision diagnosis of GAD and 26 healthy comparison subjects were recruited and tested. The employed generalization paradigm consisted of quasi-randomly presented rings of gradually increasing size, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+) and conditioned safety cues. The rings of intermediary size served as generalization stimuli, creating a continuum of similarity between CS+ and conditioned safety cues across which to assess response slopes, referred to as generalization gradients. Primary outcome variables included slopes for fear-potentiated startle (electromyography) and self-reported risk ratings. Results Behavioral and psychophysiological findings demonstrated overgeneralization of conditioned fear among patients with GAD. Specifically, generalization gradients were abnormally shallow among GAD patients, reflecting less degradation of the conditioned fear response as the presented stimulus differentiated from the CS+. Conclusions Overgeneralization of conditioned fear to safe encounters resembling feared situations may contribute importantly to the psychopathology of GAD by proliferating anxiety cues in the individual's environment that are then capable of evoking and maintaining anxiety and worry associated with GAD. © 2014 Society of Biological Psychiatry.Published by Elsevier Inc.

The study was performed in a large pig herd with about 1200 sows. Before vaccination against PCV2, farrowing rate in this farm was about 65%. Sows, boar and replacement gilts were immunized using Circovac vaccine (Merial, France) according to producer's recommendations. Parameters of production were analyzed since 2007 until 2010 in selected batches of sows inseminated at the same weeks of the year (17th, 18th, 19th and 20th) to eliminate seasonal variability. In total, 940 sows were subjected to the study. No significant changes in management during these years were introduced. The applied protocol of sow herd long-term vaccination proved to be very efficient. AH measured production parameters: reproduction rate, number of piglets born alive, birth weight of piglets and number of piglets weaned per a litter improved after implementation of immunization program. Moreover, further improvement was observed with vaccination in the following reproduction cycles. The most spectacular effect of vaccination regarded average farrowing rate that increased from 64.76% in control group to 86.93% after basic vaccination. Two years after implementation of vaccination program this parameter reached 93.6%. Number of piglets weaned per sow per a litter improved from 10.31 to 11.74 after one year of vaccination and remained relatively stable through the following year. Simultaneously, the percentage of newborn piglets with birth weight &lt; 1 kg decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05). To summarize, vaccination against PCV2 influenced positively the insemination rate, number of piglets born alive and weaned per litter as well as birth body weight and percentage of piglets weighing &lt; 1 kg.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859376159&amp;doi=10.2478%2fv10181-011-0111-y&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e85395040d7c01f3fe3a18540eb6b6df</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bellet, A.</author><author>Habrard, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Robustness and generalization for metric learning</title><secondary-title>Neurocomputing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neurocomputing</full-title></periodical><pages>259-267</pages><volume>151</volume><number>P1</number><issue>P1</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.neucom.2014.09.044</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Metric learning has attracted a lot of interest over the last decade, but the generalization ability of such methods has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we introduce an adaptation of the notion of algorithmic robustness (previously introduced by Xu and Mannor) that can be used to derive generalization bounds for metric learning. We further show that a weak notion of robustness is in fact a necessary and sufficient condition for a metric learning algorithm to generalize. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework, we derive generalization results for a large family of existing metric learning algorithms, including some sparse formulations that are not covered by the previous results. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84922712714&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2014.09.044&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f6452bc0b90d14299ca841a50df25410</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hafkenscheid, A.</author><author>Rouckhout, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact message inventory-circumplex (IMI-C): A replication study of its circumplex structure in a dutch sample</title><secondary-title>Journal of Personality Assessment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Personality Assessment</full-title></periodical><pages>417-422</pages><volume>95</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00223891.2013.765883</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The 56-items Impact Message Inventory-Circumplex (IMI-C) has been developed to describe the interpersonal styles of target persons in terms of the 2-dimensional interpersonal circle, divided in 8 subscales (octants). The IMI-C is based on the assumption that a target person's interpersonal styles can validly be measured by assessing the internal (cognitive and emotional) reactions of the IMI-C respondent (e.g., therapists), interacting with the target person (e.g., psychotherapy patients). This replication study tested the circumplexity of a computer-delivered Dutch IMI-C. The computer-delivered Dutch IMI-C approached circumplexity in a large clinical sample (N = 812) of psychotherapy and psychiatric patients, after removing 3 items from the Submissive octant scale. These 3 items clearly disturbed the IMI-C circumplex structure. It is concluded that, even with the inevitable problem of nested data, circumplexity was approached sufficiently to justify the interpretation of the IMI-C at the octant level, provided that the 3 troublesome Submissive items are removed from the calculations of octant scores. Our replication test of the Dutch IMI-C circumplexity might be an impetus for researchers in the United States to invest in the further validation of the original American version. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879091258&amp;doi=10.1080%2f00223891.2013.765883&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fa2d27b53ea8d4f5c3fb3442941491b0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boyhan, G.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimum plot size and number of replications for determining watermelon yield, fruit size, fruit firmness, and soluble solids</title><secondary-title>HortScience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HortScience</full-title></periodical><pages>1200-1208</pages><volume>48</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.21273/hortsci.48.9.1200</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Plot size and number of replications were evaluated for watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)] over a 3-year period. Four different methods were used, including plotting basic unit plots against changes in CVs, Hatheway's method for detecting a true difference as a percent of the mean with a 20% threshold, Bartlett's homogeneity of variance test, and computed least significant differences (LSDs). An initial evaluation was done in a trial with several varieties. Plotting CV against number of basic units using plots with different watermelon varieties suggests a plot size of ≈7 basic units (1 basic unit = 3.34 m2). With a single variety and basic units of 6.69 m2 for inside rows, the plot size was ≈4 basic units and for the outside row 5 basic units. With plot sizes of 2.23 m2, the number of basic units per plot was estimated at ≈5 basic units. Bartlett's test suggests larger basic unit plot sizes of 14 to 20 with a 3.34-m2 basic unit size with multiple varieties. With a single variety, 4 to 8 basic unit plot sizes are required with 6.69-m2 basic unit size. Results were unreliable with 2.23-m2 plot sizes using Bartlett's test. Computed LSDs, which were 5% of the mean or less, could be achieved with plots sizes of 10 basic units and five replications with 3.34-m2 basic unit plots and using multiple varieties. Other combinations meeting these criteria included 14 basic unit plots and two or three replications. With a 6.69-m2 basic unit size, plots of 6 basic units and four replications would meet the 5% criteria. Finally, with the 2.23-m2 basic unit size, a plot size of 8 basic units and three replications would result in an LSD of 5% of the mean. Results with Hatheway's method were similar to plots of basic units against CV. Hatheway's method also has an estimate of number of replications and with 3.34-m2 basic unit, the 20% threshold of detecting true differences occurred with 10 to 14 basic units and four replications. For fruit size, firmness, and soluble solids, the basic unit plot sizes ranged from 5 to 7. Plot size estimates were larger with 6.69 m2 compared with 2.23 m2 for fruit characteristics.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884944345&amp;doi=10.21273%2fhortsci.48.9.1200&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=075d4d6547f34f85741f99deb90bf5b5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Andrade, R.M.</author><author>Chaparro, J.D.</author><author>Capparelli, E.</author><author>Reed, S.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Auranofin Is Highly Efficacious against Toxoplasma gondii In Vitro and in an In Vivo Experimental Model of Acute Toxoplasmosis</title><secondary-title>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pntd.0002973</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background:The mainstay of toxoplasmosis treatment targets the folate biosynthetic pathways and has not changed for the last 50 years. The activity of these chemotherapeutic agents is restricted to one lifecycle stage of Toxoplasma gondii, they have significant toxicity, and the impending threat of emerging resistance to these agents makes the discovery of new therapies a priority. We now demonstrate that auranofin, an orally administered gold containing compound that was FDA approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has activity against Toxoplasma gondii in vitro (IC50 = 0.28 μM) and in vivo (1 mg/kg).Methods/Principal Findings:Replication within human foreskin fibroblasts of RH tachyzoites was inhibited by auranofin. At 0.4 μM, auranofin inhibited replication, as measured by percent infected fibroblasts at 24 hrs, (10.94% vs. 24.66% of controls; p = 0.0003) with no effect on parasite invasion (16.95% vs. 12.91% p = 0.4331). After 18 hrs, 62% of extracellular parasites treated with auranofin were non-viable compared to control using an ATP viability assay (p = 0.0003). In vivo, a previously standardized chicken embryo model of acute toxoplasmosis was used. Fourteen day old chicken embryos were injected through the chorioallantoic vein with 1×104 tachyzoites of the virulent RH strain. The treatment group received one dose of auranofin at the time of inoculation (1 mg/kg estimated body weight). On day 5, auranofin-treated chicken embryos were 100% protected against death (p = 0.0002) and had a significantly reduced parasite load as determined by histopathology, immunohistochemistry and by the number of parasites quantified by real-time PCR.Conclusions:These results reveal in vitro and in vivo activity of auranofin against T. gondii, suggesting that it may be an effective alternative treatment for toxoplasmosis. © 2014 Andrade et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905510190&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0002973&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dea9a09228455949c9d9a462599114ef</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramesh, R.</author><author>Seshasayanan, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving the Performance of MIMO-OFDM Using a Novel Precoding Approach for Achieving High Throughput</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Applied Engineering Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Applied Engineering Research</full-title></periodical><pages>21687-21700</pages><volume>9</volume><number>23</number><issue>23</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>In recent year a lot of detection techniques are available for improving the performance of MIMO-OFDM. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which is a combination of, a fast FFT architecture is addressed with linear Precoding and zero forcing detection technique, the throughput increased and the power minimized in MIMO-OFDM in a better manner. Fastest FFT reduces the memory usage such that it reduces power, the performance can be obtained by evaluating by finding the parameters S.R and BER. The linear Precoding design is general, and as a special case it solves the beam forming problem. The zero forcing (ZF) detection technique optimized the MMS. - [minimum mean square error] and ML - [maximum likelihood]. The proposed approach creates an efficient auto correspondence system based time multiplexing and the use of abridged testers while conserving the recital by applying a stepwise procedure and an N x N MIMOOFDM scheme is used for the recital assessment. The replication results demonstrate that the recital of the proposed novel method based recognition methods is much better than the conservative approaches.

Increased cardiovascular risk in SLE is not explained by traditional risk factors. We examined the hypothesis that genetic variation contributes to the presence of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with SLE. The genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 152 candidate genes linked with autoimmune or cardiovascular risk were determined in 125 patients with SLE. Coronary artery calcium (CAC), a measure of coronary atherosclerosis, was detected in 32 patients (26%) by electron-beam computed tomography. Polymorphism in 20 of the candidate genes (ADAM33, ADIPOQ, CCL5, CCR7, CDKN2B, CSF1, IL4, IL12A, IL23R, INS, IRF5, MIF, MS4A1, PTGS1, PTPN22, RETN, SELE, TNFSF4, TNFRSF11B, and VCAM1) were nominally associated with the presence of CAC (p-values = 0.001-0.047 after adjustment for age, sex and race). Some of these are known susceptibility genes for SLE and others have been implicated in cardiovascular disease in other populations. No association withstood false discovery rate adjustment.

Here we present the first GC-Py-IRMS δ18O results for trimethylsilyl-derivatives of plant sap-relevant sugars and a polyalcohol (glucose, fructose, sucrose, raffinose and pinitol). Particularly, we focus on sucrose, which is assimilated in leaves and which is the most important transport sugar in plants and hence of utmost relevance in plant physiology and paleoclimate studies. Replication measurements of sucrose standards and concentration series indicate that the GC-Py-IRMS δ18O measurements are not stable over time and that they are amount (area) dependent. We, therefore, suggest running sample batch replication measurements in alternation with standard concentration series of reference material. This allows for carrying out (i) a drift correction, (ii) a calibration against reference material and (iii) an amount (area) correction. Tests with 18O-enriched water do not provide any evidence for oxygen isotope exchange reactions affecting sucrose and raffinose. We present the first application of GC-Py-IRMS δ18O analysis for sucrose from needle extract (soluble carbohydrate) samples. The obtained δ18Osucrose/ Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) values are more positive and vary in a wider range (32.1-40.1 ‰) than the δ18Obulk/ VSMOW values (24.6-27.2 ‰). Furthermore, they are shown to depend on the climate parameters maximum day temperature, relative air humidity and cloud cover. These findings suggest that δ18Osucrose of the investigated needles very sensitively reflects the climatically controlled evaporative 18O enrichment of leaf water and thus highlights the great potential of GC-Py-IRMS δ18Osucrose analysis for plant physiology and paleoclimate studies. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890237761&amp;doi=10.1080%2f10256016.2013.824875&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=faa9704cbeb38066180e63893e9b0c64</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mastropieri, M.A.</author><author>Scruggs, T.E.</author><author>Cerar, N.I.</author><author>Allen-Bronaugh, D.</author><author>Thompson, C.</author><author>Guckert, M.</author><author>Leins, P.</author><author>Hauth, C.</author><author>Cuenca-Sanchez, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fluent Persuasive Writing With Counterarguments for Students With Emotional Disturbance</title><secondary-title>Journal of Special Education</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Special Education</full-title></periodical><pages>17-31</pages><volume>48</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0022466912440456</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Twelve seventh- and eighth-grade students with emotional disturbance participated in a multiple probe, multiple baseline design two-phase intervention study to improve persuasive writing skills.

Several authors proposed that, after the last glaciation, asexual lineages would spread throughout Europe more efficiently than sexual ones. The range expansion, that followed metapopulation dynamics characterized by genetic bottlenecks and subsequent inbreeding/outbreeding depression, had strong negative fitness consequences in sexuals. Using controlled crosses we estimated inbreeding and outbreeding depression in the sexual populations of H. incongruens and E. virens and compared the experimental reproduction rate in sexual and asexual females of both species. Inbreeding depression varied according to species and fitness components but, in general, was not significantly different between inbred and outbred crosses. In H. incongruens, inbred crosses produced a higher percentage of resting eggs and had higher fecundity than intrapopulation outbred crosses. Reproduction rate in asexuals of both species was about twice that in sexuals. Our data does not support the hypothesis that sexual populations exhibit inbreeding depression in geographic parthenogens. However, outbreeding depression and the lower efficiency of sexuals in establishing new populations may account for the role of metapopulation dynamics in geographic parthenogenesis of both species. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Unione Zoologica Italiana.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84871506667&amp;doi=10.1080%2f11250003.2012.718375&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5a4dfcd8403bbae726d3aa8c88465819</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Faehnrich, B.</author><author>Nemaz, P.</author><author>Franz, Ch.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Self-incompatibility and male sterility in six Matricaria recutita varieties</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Botany and Food Quality</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Botany and Food Quality</full-title></periodical><pages>167-171</pages><volume>86</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5073/JABFQ.2013.086.022</electronic-resource-num><abstract>On purpose to develop suitable mother lines for a large scale hybrid production of the medicinal crop species Matricaria recutita [L.] Rauschert investigations to - determine the proportions of self and cross fertilization, - identify self-incompatible genotypes and - observe spontaneous or induced male sterility were undertaken. The seed production per flower head under isolated and under untreated control-conditions was evaluated in six German chamomile varieties. Under assumption of equal behaviour of plants concerning their reproduction rate results showed opposed reactions of the auto-tetraploid 'Manzana' and the diploid 'Degumille' to isolation. Moreover, slightly significant interactions between cultivars and treatment concerning seed production per flower head indicate the influence of isolation being cultivar specific. An average of 22 % of self-fertilization under open pollination conditions is displayed over all cultivars. Highly significant differences between cultivars reveal cultivar specific self-incompatibility, at which the diploid varieties 'Bona' and 'Degumille' exhibit the highest levels of 25 % and 28 %, respectively. 9 of 1105 plants showed spontaneous single flower head aberrations indicating possible tendencies to male sterility. Spontaneous pollen sterility, estimated after aceto-carmine staining, reached mean levels between 0.5 % ('Bona') and 2.4 % ('Lutea'). The progeny after crossings across all six varieties showed an average of 10.20 % pollen sterility indicating a tendency of increasing pollen sterility by intra-specific crossings. Nevertheless, as the best way to raise suitable mother lines the development of vegetatively propagated self-incompatible diploid genotypes can be recommended.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920456042&amp;doi=10.5073%2fJABFQ.2013.086.022&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d25ea6ea953ee30773efafef17ac6f3b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raudies, F.</author><author>Zilli, E.A.</author><author>Hasselmo, M.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep belief networks learn context dependent behavior</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0093250</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the goal of understanding behavioral mechanisms of generalization, we analyzed the ability of neural networks to generalize across context. We modeled a behavioral task where the correct responses to a set of specific sensory stimuli varied systematically across different contexts. The correct response depended on the stimulus (A,B,C,D) and context quadrant (1,2,3,4). The possible 16 stimulus-context combinations were associated with one of two responses (X,Y), one of which was correct for half of the combinations. The correct responses varied symmetrically across contexts. This allowed responses to previously unseen stimuli (probe stimuli) to be generalized from stimuli that had been presented previously. By testing the simulation on two or more stimuli that the network had never seen in a particular context, we could test whether the correct response on the novel stimuli could be generated based on knowledge of the correct responses in other contexts. We tested this generalization capability with a Deep Belief Network (DBN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network, and the combination of a DBN with a linear perceptron (LP). Overall, the combination of the DBN and LP had the highest success rate for generalization. © 2014 Raudies et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899838187&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0093250&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c1b8ceb0291310bd34c10bb8ff5ffee8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karantzas, G.C.</author><author>Davison, T.E.</author><author>McCabe, M.P.</author><author>Mellor, D.</author><author>Beaton, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring carers' knowledge of depression in aged care settings: The Knowledge of Late Life Depression Scale - Revised</title><secondary-title>Journal of Affective Disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Affective Disorders</full-title></periodical><pages>417-424</pages><volume>138</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jad.2012.01.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Aged care staff is increasingly relied upon to assist with the recognition and treatment of depression in older care recipients. However, there exist few reliable and comprehensive measures that assess aged care staffs' knowledge about late life depression. The Knowledge of Late-Life Depression Scale is one such scale. In this study we modified this measure in an attempt to improve its psychometric properties so that it can be used with confidence in research and practise. Our modifications to the original measure resulted in the Knowledge of Late-Life Depression Scale - Revised. Method: Aged care staff (N = 149) from 20 low level care facilities and community care facilities in Melbourne, Australia, completed the Knowledge of Late-Life Depression Scale - Revised. Results: Using Confirmatory Factor Analysis and reliability analysis, the Knowledge of Late-Life Depression Scale - Revised was found to demonstrate three robust and internally consistent factors. These factors were: symptoms of depression, facts about depression, and myths of depression. The revised measure was found to yield superior psychometric properties compared to the original measure. Limitations: Replication studies are required, especially with other aged carer samples to ensure that the factor structure and internal consistency of the measure are supported across different aged care contexts in Australia and elsewhere. Conclusions: The Knowledge of Late-Life Depression - Revised is a measure that can be used by researchers and agencies to assess the knowledge of depression among professional care staff. The measure is expected to be especially useful as an assessment tool for training and educational purposes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

VACV replication efficiency plays a crucial role in the therapeutic outcome. However, little is known about the influence of host factors on viral replication efficiency and permissiveness of a host cell line to infection and oncolysis. In this study, replication of the attenuated VACV GLV-1h68 strain and three wild-type VACV isolates was determined in two autologous human melanoma cell lines (888-MEL and 1936-MEL). Host gene expression and viral gene expression in infected cells were evaluated via respective expression array platforms. Microarray analyses followed by sequential statistical approaches characterized human genes that change specifically due to virus infection. Viral gene transcription correlated with viral replication in a time-dependent manner. A set of human genes revealed strong correlations with the respective viral gene expression. Finally we identified a set of human genes with possible predictive value for viral replication in an independent dataset. The results demonstrate a probable correlation between viral replication, early gene expression, and the respective host response, and thus a possible involvement of human host factors in viral early replication. The characterization of human target genes that influence viral replication could help answer the question of host cell permissiveness to oncolytic virotherapy and provide important information for the development of novel recombinant vaccinia viruses with improved features to enhance replication rate and hence trigger therapeutic outcome. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878746275&amp;doi=10.1089%2fhgtb.2012.057&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6818cc07be54cc32d2620860e9aab6b5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Uk, C.S.</author><author>Kang, J.-G.</author><author>Lee, T.-W.</author><author>Gyun, M.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tracking algorithm and its implementation of the vehicle BSR noise location</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering</secondary-title></titles><pages>629-635</pages><volume>201 LNEE</volume><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-642-33832-8_50</electronic-resource-num><abstract>It is hard to estimate the location of BSR noise and quantify BSR noise due to three main reasons as the followings: ambiguity of representation of BSR noise, quantification of evaluation, and reproduction experiment.

The influence of maternal immunity on IAV transmission in neonatal pig populations will impact virus prevalence and infection dynamics across pig populations. The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of maternally derived immunity on IAV transmission in an experimental setting. Neonatal pigs suckled colostrum and derived maternal (passive) immunity from sows in one of three treatment groups: (a) non-vaccinated control (CTRL) or vaccinated with (b) homologous (PASSV-HOM) or (c) heterologous (PASSV-HET) inactivated experimental IAV vaccines. Sentinel neonatal pigs derived from the groups above were challenged with IAV via direct contact with an experimentally infected pig (seeder pig) and monitored for IAV infection daily via nasal swab sampling. A susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) experimental model was used to obtain and estimate transmission parameters in each treatment group via a generalized linear model. All sentinel pigs in the CTRL (30/30) and PASSV-HET (30/30) groups were infected with IAV following contact with the seeder pigs and the reproduction ratio estimates (95% confidence interval) were 10.4 (6.6-15.8) and 7.1 (4.2-11.3), respectively. In contrast, 1/20 sentinel pigs in the PASSV-HOM group was infected following contact with the seeder pigs and the reproduction ratio estimate was significantly lower compared to the CTRL and PASSV-HET groups at 0.8 (0.1-3.7). Under the conditions of this study, IAV transmission was reduced in neonatal pigs with homologous maternal immunity compared to seronegative neonatal pigs and pigs with heterologous maternal immunity as defined in this study. This study provides estimates for IAV transmission in pigs with differing types of maternal immunity which may describe the influence of maternal immunity on IAV prevalence and infection dynamics in pig populations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84871648925&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.vaccine.2012.11.023&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=61249d9e9e79fd6d9a8b88f04991981e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Erdodi, L.A.</author><author>Lajiness-O'Neill, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time-related changes in conners' CPT-II scores: A replication study</title><secondary-title>Applied Neuropsychology:Adult</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Neuropsychology:Adult</full-title></periodical><pages>43-50</pages><volume>21</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/09084282.2012.724036</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The objective of this study was to replicate an earlier study on the effect of the administration sequence on Conners' Continuous Performance Test-Second Edition (CPT-II) scores (Erdodi, Lajiness-O'Neill, &amp; Saules, 2010). Participants were recruited at a university training clinic (13 males, 12 females; M age= 26.7 years, SD = 13.3), and they were administered the CPT-II twice in the same day: at the beginning and at the end of the testing session. The overall trends described in the original study were observed in the present sample. However, order effects were generally less pronounced. The pre-post contrast on the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Index score was not statistically significant. The Neurological Index was more impaired at Time 2 (M = 36.3, SD = 19.7) compared with Time 1 (M = 33.3, SD = 19.9): t(17) = 1.63, p =.06, d = 0.38. Likewise, pre-post changes were detected in the number of T-scores &gt;60 from Time 1 (M = 1.6, SD = 2.1) to Time 2 (M = 2.3, SD = 2.8): t(23) = 2.53, p &lt;.05, d = 0.52. Time-related changes in the CPT-II scores appear to be reliable and are likely mediated by the presence of ADHD, perhaps as a precipitator of mental fatigue. Order effects have the potential to function as an emergent diagnostic marker of ADHD. © 2014 Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904971155&amp;doi=10.1080%2f09084282.2012.724036&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=233dad5330a4ed9dad9fd760f277239a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lim, A.S.P.</author><author>Chang, A.-M.</author><author>Shulman, J.M.</author><author>Raj, T.</author><author>Chibnik, L.B.</author><author>Cain, S.W.</author><author>Rothamel, K.</author><author>Benoist, C.</author><author>Myers, A.J.</author><author>Czeisler, C.A.</author><author>Buchman, A.S.</author><author>Bennett, D.A.</author><author>Duffy, J.F.</author><author>Saper, C.B.</author><author>De Jager, P.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A common polymorphism near PER1 and the timing of human behavioral rhythms</title><secondary-title>Annals of Neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Neurology</full-title></periodical><pages>324-334</pages><volume>72</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ana.23636</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: Circadian rhythms influence the timing of behavior, neurological diseases, and even death. Rare mutations in homologs of evolutionarily conserved clock genes are found in select pedigrees with extreme sleep timing, and there is suggestive evidence that certain common polymorphisms may be associated with self-reported day/night preference. However, no common polymorphism has been associated with the timing of directly observed human behavioral rhythms or other physiological markers of circadian timing at the population level. Methods: We performed a candidate gene association study with replication, evaluating associations between polymorphisms in homologs of evolutionarily conserved clock genes and the timing of behavioral rhythms measured by actigraphy. For validated polymorphisms, we evaluated associations with transcript expression and time of death in additional cohorts. Results: rs7221412, a common polymorphism near period homolog 1 (PER1), was associated with the timing of activity rhythms in both the discovery and replication cohorts (joint p = 2.1 × 10-7). Mean activity timing was delayed by 67 minutes in rs7221412GG versus rs7221412AA homozygotes. rs7221412 also showed a suggestive time-dependent relationship with both cerebral cortex (p = 0.05) and CD14+CD16- monocyte (p = 0.02) PER1 expression and an interesting association with time of death (p = 0.015) in which rs7221412GG individuals had a mean time of death nearly 7 hours later than rs7221412AA/AG. Interpretation: A common polymorphism near PER1 is associated with the timing of human behavioral rhythms, and shows evidence of association with time of death. This may be mediated by differential PER1 expression. These results may facilitate individualized scheduling of shift work, medical treatments, or monitoring of vulnerable patient populations.

The longer life attained by drying is however accompanied by huge energy consumption and deterioration of quality. Moisture diffusivity is an important factor that is considered essential to understand for design, analysis, and optimization of drying processes for food and other materials. Without an accurate value of moisture diffusivity, drying kinetics, energy consumption, quality attributes such as shrinkage, texture, and microstructure cannot be predicted properly. However, moisture diffusivities differ due to variation of composition and microstructure of foodstuff and drying variables. For a particular food, it changes with many factors including moisture content, water holding capacity, process variables and physiochemical attributes of food. Published information on moisture diffusivities of banana is inadequate and sometimes inconsistent due to lack of precise repeatable analysis techniques. In this work, the effective moisture diffusivity of banana was determined by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), which ensures precise measurements and reproduction of experiments. A TGA Q500 V20.13 Build 39 was deployed to obtain the drying curve of the food material. It was found that effective moisture diffusivity ranged from 6.63 ×10-10 to 1.03 ×10-9 and 1.34 ×10-10 to 6.60 ×10-10 for isothermal at 70 °C and non-isothermal process respectively.These values are consistent with the value of moisture diffusivity found in the literature. © 2014 The Authors.

We hypothesized that technical and nontechnical performance in the simulated environment is related to other various criterion measures, providing evidence to support the validity of the scores from the performance-based assessment. METHODS: Twelve third-year anesthesia residents participated in a series of 6 short 5-minute scenarios and 1 longer 30-minute scenario. The short scenarios measured technical skills, whereas the longer one focused on nontechnical skills. Two independent raters scored subjects using analytic and holistic ratings. Short scenarios involved acute hemorrhage, blocked endotracheal tube, bronchospasm, hyperkalemia, tension pneumothorax, and unstable ventricular tachycardia. The long scenario concerned management of myocardial ischemia/infarction leading to cardiac arrest. Scores from the simulations were correlated with (a) rankings generated from an Internet-based global ranking instrument that categorized residents based on overall clinical ability and (b) residency board scores. RESULTS: There were moderate correlations between various participant scores from the simulation-based assessment and aggregate rankings based on the global ranking instrument and residency examination scores. CONCLUSIONS: The associations between simulator performance, both for technical and nontechnical skills, and other markers of ability provide some evidence to support the validity of simulation-based assessment scores. Replication studies with larger numbers of residents are warranted.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859735720&amp;doi=10.1097%2fSIH.0b013e31823d018a&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ce7dfa645e59b61f5762a7b2f822cd4e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Makel, M.C.</author><author>Plucker, J.A.</author><author>Hegarty, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replications in Psychology Research: How Often Do They Really Occur?</title><secondary-title>Perspectives on Psychological Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Perspectives on Psychological Science</full-title></periodical><pages>537-542</pages><volume>7</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1745691612460688</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent controversies in psychology have spurred conversations about the nature and quality of psychological research. One topic receiving substantial attention is the role of replication in psychological science. Using the complete publication history of the 100 psychology journals with the highest 5-year impact factors, the current article provides an overview of replications in psychological research since 1900. This investigation revealed that roughly 1.6% of all psychology publications used the term replication in text. A more thorough analysis of 500 randomly selected articles revealed that only 68% of articles using the term replication were actual replications, resulting in an overall replication rate of 1.07%. Contrary to previous findings in other fields, this study found that the majority of replications in psychology journals reported similar findings to their original studies (i.e., they were successful replications). However, replications were significantly less likely to be successful when there was no overlap in authorship between the original and replicating articles. Moreover, despite numerous systemic biases, the rate at which replications are being published has increased in recent decades. © The Author(s) 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84869074244&amp;doi=10.1177%2f1745691612460688&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7081b5cb8a806ac5638d28fdd6c9e6cc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hsu, Y.-C.</author><author>Cheng, P.-Y.</author><author>Lee, H.-W.</author><author>Su, S.-F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unsaturated polyesters as stamps for hot embossing of micropumps</title><secondary-title>Applied Mechanics and Materials</secondary-title></titles><pages>547-550</pages><volume>607</volume><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.607.547</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We investigated two processes to fabricate unsaturated polyesters, UP, to serve as a stamp to emboss a microfluidic chip to apply to a peristaltic micropump. The mechanical properties of UP are great to apply to vibration type micro-actuators. However, it's rarely discussed academically. As a result, we proposed two processes developed and compared macro-and micro-scopically. It was first observed that process I of traditional UP curing process and process II of modified process can both replicate the geometries of microfludic chips well macroscopically. In addition, the former one has macroscopic defaults like cracks, bend, and separation between vessel and UP molds, while the latter one doesn't. Optical microscope and confocal microscope are also applied to verify the replication effects microscopically. Again, both processes illustrate good replication results with variation of both lengths and areas all less than 10%, while process II has better geometries and lower deviation on different sites. The process I was proven that the averages of depth and widest width change rates for replication are-1. 06% (between-4. 15% and 2. 89%) and-2. 77% (between-6. 93% and 0. 67%), respectively. And, the replication results of process II shows also reasonable change and even smaller deviations that the averages of depth and widest width change rates are-4. 77% (between-6. 33% and-3. 84%) and 1. 53% (between 1. 15% and 2. 15%), respectively. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905842996&amp;doi=10.4028%2fwww.scientific.net%2fAMM.607.547&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0d3f4d85d477426939cc99b95de61b9e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Couto-Alves, A.</author><author>Wright, V.J.</author><author>Perumal, K.</author><author>Binder, A.</author><author>Carrol, E.D.</author><author>Emonts, M.</author><author>de Groot, R.</author><author>Hazelzet, J.</author><author>Kuijpers, T.</author><author>Nadel, S.</author><author>Zenz, W.</author><author>Ramnarayan, P.</author><author>Levin, M.</author><author>Coin, L.</author><author>Inwald, D.P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A new scoring system derived from base excess and platelet count at presentation predicts mortality in paediatric meningococcal sepsis</title><secondary-title>Critical Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Critical Care</full-title></periodical><volume>17</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/cc12609</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction: The aim of this study was to derive a novel prognostic score for mortality in paediatric meningococcal sepsis (MS) based on readily available laboratory markers.Methods: A multicentre retrospective cohort study for the consortium set and a single centre retrospective study for replication set. The consortium set were 1,073 children (age 1 week to 17.9 years) referred over a 15-year period (1996 to 2011), who had an admission diagnosis of MS, referred to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in six different European centres. The consortium set was split into a development set and validation set to derive the score. The replication set were 134 children with MS (age 2 weeks to 16 years) referred over a 4-year period (2007 to 2011) to PICUs via the Children's Acute Transport Service (CATS), London.Results: A total of 85/1,073 (7.9%) children in the consortium set died. A total of 16/134 (11.9%) children in the replication set died. Children dying in the consortium set had significantly lower base excess, C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet and white cell count, more deranged coagulation and higher lactate than survivors. Paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score, Glasgow meningococcal septicaemia prognosis score (GMSPS) and Rotterdam score were also higher. Using the consortium set, a new scoring system using base excess and platelet count at presentation, termed the BEP score, was mathematically developed and validated. BEP predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity scores (area under the curve (AUC) in the validation set = 0.86 and in the replication set = 0.96). In the validation set, BEP score performance (AUC = 0.86, confidence interval (CI): 0.80 to 0.91) was better than GMSPS (AUC = 0.77, CI: 0.68, 0.85), similar to Rotterdam (AUC = 0.87, CI: 0.81 to 0.93) and not as good as PRISM (AUC = 0.93, CI: 0.85 to 0.97).Conclusions: The BEP score, relying on only two variables that are quickly and objectively measurable and readily available at presentation, is highly sensitive and specific in predicting death from MS in childhood. © 2013 Couto-Alves et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878107523&amp;doi=10.1186%2fcc12609&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f6ab23c93a03dc8d458c944e57087221</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tulloch, F.</author><author>Pathania, U.</author><author>Luke, G.A.</author><author>Nicholson, J.</author><author>Stonehouse, N.J.</author><author>Rowlands, D.J.</author><author>Jackson, T.</author><author>Tuthill, T.</author><author>Haas, J.</author><author>Lamond, A.I.</author><author>Ryan, M.D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FMDV replicons encoding green fluorescent protein are replication competent</title><secondary-title>Journal of Virological Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Virological Methods</full-title></periodical><pages>35-40</pages><volume>209</volume><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.08.020</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The study of replication of viruses that require high bio-secure facilities can be accomplished with less stringent containment using non-infectious 'replicon' systems. The FMDV replicon system (pT7rep) reported by Mclnerney et al. (2000) was modified by the replacement of sequences encoding chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) with those encoding a functional L proteinase (Lpro) linked to a bi-functional fluorescent/antibiotic resistance fusion protein (green fluorescent protein/puromycin resistance, [GFP-PAC]). Cells were transfected with replicon-derived transcript RNA and GFP fluorescence quantified. Replication of transcript RNAs was readily detected by fluorescence, whilst the signal from replication-incompetent forms of the genome was &gt;2-fold lower. Surprisingly, a form of the replicon lacking the Lpro showed a significantly stronger fluorescence signal, but appeared with slightly delayed kinetics. Replication can, therefore, be quantified simply by live-cell imaging and image analyses, providing a rapid and facile alternative to RT-qPCR or CAT assays. © 2014 The Authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907521743&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jviromet.2014.08.020&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=69aec78d12f94449bc9e41e1bb20331e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sloff, M.</author><author>De Vries, R.</author><author>Geutjes, P.</author><author>In't Hout, J.</author><author>Ritskes-Hoitinga, M.</author><author>Oosterwijk, E.</author><author>Feitz, W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tissue engineering in animal models for urinary diversion: A systematic review</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0098734</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) approaches may provide alternatives for gastrointestinal tissue in urinary diversion. To continue to clinically translatable studies, TERM alternatives need to be evaluated in (large) controlled and standardized animal studies. Here, we investigated all evidence for the efficacy of tissue engineered constructs in animal models for urinary diversion. Studies investigating this subject were identified through a systematic search of three different databases (PubMed, Embase and Web of Science). From each study, animal characteristics, study characteristics and experimental outcomes for meta-analyses were tabulated. Furthermore, the reporting of items vital for study replication was assessed. The retrieved studies (8 in total) showed extreme heterogeneity in study design, including animal models, biomaterials and type of urinary diversion. All studies were feasibility studies, indicating the novelty of this field. None of the studies included appropriate control groups, i.e. a comparison with the classical treatment using GI tissue. The meta-analysis showed a trend towards successful experimentation in larger animals although no specific animal species could be identified as the most suitable model. Larger animals appear to allow a better translation to the human situation, with respect to anatomy and surgical approaches. It was unclear whether the use of cells benefits the formation of a neo urinary conduit. The reporting of the methodology and data according to standardized guidelines was insufficient and should be improved to increase the value of such publications. In conclusion, animal models in the field of TERM for urinary diversion have probably been chosen for reasons other than their predictive value. Controlled and comparative long term animal studies, with adequate methodological reporting are needed to proceed to clinical translatable studies. This will aid in good quality research with the reduction in the use of animals and an increase in empirical evidence of biomedical research. © 2014 Sloff et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903530562&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0098734&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f583432aad820378a308ca399fc57447</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saito, M.M.</author><author>Imoto, S.</author><author>Yamaguchi, R.</author><author>Miyano, S.</author><author>Higuchi, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifiability of local transmissibility parameters in agent-based pandemic simulation</title><secondary-title>15th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION 2012</secondary-title></titles><pages>2466-2471</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Agent-based simulation is one of the approaches that can be applied to simulate the transmission of infectious disease such as influenza within a city. Several types of agents with different behaviours are allocated to a model city and the transmission between city residents is stochastically solved locally. Simulations corresponding to specific intervention measures are carried out. However, due to the large number of parameters in the simulation, which cannot be fully constrained by surveillance evidence and epidemiological knowledge, one sometimes judges candidate intervention measures from simulation results with arbitrarily fixed parameters. In the present study, we have conducted numerical experiments to estimate reproduction numbers (transmissibility parameters) in workplaces and in homes from pseudo-observation time-course data generated by a simulation run. This pseudo-observation is generated under the assumption that transmission in workplaces is more effective than in homes. The ratio of these numbers are considered to affect the response to intervention. Our experiments indicate that a profile consisting of the total number of patients is insufficient; rather, a role-specific profile is needed to reconstruct the assumption on the ratio of reproduction numbers. © 2012 ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867638003&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f5843e38daa280cbd5f5f1b8849f7fca</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hartshorne, J.K.</author><author>Schachner, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tracking replicability as a method of post-publication open evaluation</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><number>MARCH 2012</number><issue>MARCH 2012</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Recent reports have suggested that many published results are unreliable. To increase the reliability and accuracy of published papers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes in statistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe that the incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for such reforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality of individual scientists is judged on the basis of their number of publications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbers of citations. Neither of these measures takes into account the replicability of the published findings, as false or controversial results are often particularly widely cited. We propose tracking replications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to help researchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize the publication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires a database linking published studies that replicate one another. As any such database is limited by the number of replication attempts published, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated to publishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database and the affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination of crowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database are aggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicability scores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate the quality of work published in individual journals. In this paper, we lay out a detailed description of how this system could be implemented, including mechanisms for compiling the information, ensuring data quality, and incentivizing the research community to participate. © 2012 Hartshorne and Schachner.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857987676&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ce5dd8f8c021c702f4e250a80bb92c27</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spann, K.M.</author><author>Baturcam, E.</author><author>Schagen, J.</author><author>Jones, C.</author><author>Straub, C.P.</author><author>Preston, F.M.</author><author>Chen, L.</author><author>Phipps, S.</author><author>Sly, P.D.</author><author>Fantino, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Viral and host factors determine innate immune responses in airway epithelial cells from children with wheeze and atopy</title><secondary-title>Thorax</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Thorax</full-title></periodical><pages>918-925</pages><volume>69</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-204908</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background Airway epithelial cells (AEC) from patients with asthma, appear to have an impaired interferon (IFN)-β and -λ response to infection with rhinovirus. Objectives To determine if impaired IFN responses can be identified in young children at risk of developing asthma due to atopy and/or early life wheeze, and if the site of infection or the infecting virus influence the antiviral response. Methods Nasal (N) and tracheal (T) epithelial cells (EC) were collected from children categorised with atopy and/ or wheeze based on specifi c IgE to locally common aeroallergens and a questionnaire concerning respiratory health. Submerged primary cultures were infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and IFN production, inflammatory cytokine expression and viral replication quantified. Results Nasal epithelial cells (NEC), but not tracheal epithelial cells (TEC), from children with wheeze and/or atopy produced less IFN-β, but not IFN-λ, in response to RSV infection; this was associated with higher viral shedding. However, IFN-regulated factors IRF-7, Mx-1 and CXCL-10, and inflammatory cytokines were not differentially regulated. NECs and TECs from children with wheeze and/or atopy demonstrated no impairment of the IFN response (β or λ) to hMPV infection. Despite this, more hMPV was shed from these cells. Conclusions AECs from children with wheeze and/or atopy do not have an intrinsic defect in the production of IFN-β or -λ, however, this response is influenced by the infecting virus. Higher viral load is associated with atopy and wheeze suggesting an impaired antiviral response to RSV and hMPV that is not influenced by production of IFNs.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899774977&amp;doi=10.1136%2fthoraxjnl-2013-204908&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ab4084a7766fc0f39e6f1f59cb706b7c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mariotti, J.</author><author>Maura, F.</author><author>Spina, F.</author><author>Roncari, L.</author><author>Dodero, A.</author><author>Farina, L.</author><author>Montefusco, V.</author><author>Carniti, C.</author><author>Sarina, B.</author><author>Patriarca, F.</author><author>Rambaldi, A.</author><author>Onida, F.</author><author>Olivieri, A.</author><author>Zallio, F.</author><author>Corradini, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of cytomegalovirus replication and cytomegalovirus serostatus on the outcome of patients with B cell lymphoma after allogeneic stem cell transplantation</title><secondary-title>Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation</full-title></periodical><pages>885-890</pages><volume>20</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbmt.2014.02.015</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was historically associated with increased nonrelapse mortality (NRM). More recently, different groups have reported an association between CMV replication and reduced risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse. Given the conflicting results, we evaluated the impact of CMV replication and other covariates on the outcome of a retrospective cohort of 265 adults with B cell lymphoma receiving allogeneic HSCT from HLA-identical siblings or alternative donors. In time-dependent multivariate analysis, CMV replication, evaluated by pp65 antigenemia, had no independent effect on the risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], .6 to 1.6; P = .9), although it was associated with a reduced overall survival (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.2; P = .001) and an increased NRM (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3; P = .01). Consistently, donor and/or recipient CMV seropositivity were not associated with a different outcome relative to CMV double-negative serostatus. In multivariate models, a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (P &lt; .0001) and pretransplantation complete remission status (P &lt; .0001) were the main independent predictors for improved relapse-free survival. In summary, contrary to what is observed in patients with AML, this report identifies no independent role for CMV replication or serostatus on the relapse of patients with B cell lymphomas undergoing allogeneic HSCT. © 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899991642&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.bbmt.2014.02.015&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=346d422c8035304d2c243764e08b73b9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, H.</author><author>Park, C.M.</author><author>Song, Y.S.</author><author>Lee, S.M.</author><author>Goo, J.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of radiation dose and iterative reconstruction algorithms for measurement accuracy and reproducibility of pulmonary nodule volumetry: A phantom study</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Radiology</full-title></periodical><pages>848-857</pages><volume>83</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ejrad.2014.01.025</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose To evaluate the influence of radiation dose settings and reconstruction algorithms on the measurement accuracy and reproducibility of semi-automated pulmonary nodule volumetry. Materials and methods CT scans were performed on a chest phantom containing various nodules (10 and 12 mm; +100, -630 and -800 HU) at 120 kVp with tube current-time settings of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mAs. Each CT was reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP), iDose4 and iterative model reconstruction (IMR). Semi-automated volumetry was performed by two radiologists using commercial volumetry software for nodules at each CT dataset. Noise, contrast-to-noise ratio and signal-to-noise ratio of CT images were also obtained. The absolute percentage measurement errors and differences were then calculated for volume and mass. The influence of radiation dose and reconstruction algorithm on measurement accuracy, reproducibility and objective image quality metrics was analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Results Measurement accuracy and reproducibility of nodule volume and mass were not significantly associated with CT radiation dose settings or reconstruction algorithms (p &gt; 0.05). Objective image quality metrics of CT images were superior in IMR than in FBP or iDose4 at all radiation dose settings (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Semi-automated nodule volumetry can be applied to low- or ultralow-dose chest CT with usage of a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm without losing measurement accuracy and reproducibility. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897397870&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.ejrad.2014.01.025&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b3bccb2021711d89ca5b61daaed0945c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bat Or, M.</author><author>Ishai, R.</author><author>Levi, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validating PPAT's symbolic meanings of emotional and cognitive functioning among children</title><secondary-title>Arts in Psychotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arts in Psychotherapy</full-title></periodical><pages>309-319</pages><volume>41</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aip.2014.05.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The present study inquired into the symbolic content of PPAT drawings ( Gantt, 1990) of children age 5-6.5 years. An innovative scoring system (SC-PPAT/c: Symbolic Content in PPAT/children: Bat Or et al., 2014) was developed for scoring symbolic aspects in PPAT as related to the drawn objects in the drawing - person, tree, and apple - as well as their inter-relationships. Specifically, this study explored correlations between PPAT's symbolic content with cognitive (executive functions) and emotional behaviors, self-potency, and motivation of 126 children who were measured by valid tools, respectively: four BRIEF scales ( Gioia, Isquith, Guy, &amp; Kenworthy, 2000), three CBCL scales - Child Behavior Check List ( Achenbach, 1991), CAMP - Child Adaptation and Measure of Potency ( Lev-Weizel, Besser, &amp; Laish, 2005); and the CMS: Children's Motivation Scale ( Gerring et al., 1996). The SC-PPAT/c was found to be a reliable tool in terms of inter-rater reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient range r= .785-.969) and valid in terms of significant associations with cognitive and emotional aspects. Significant negative correlations were found between low cognitive executive functions and the degree the person was drawn as being active in the picking process ( r= -.259, p&lt;. 0.01), with trunk inclines toward the person ( r= -.283, p&lt;. 0.01), and with degree of success in the picking process ( r= -.210, p&lt;. 0.05). Significant and meaningful gender differences were found in regards to the relation of PPAT with all validity criterion variables. For example, while a positive strong correlation was found between girls' aggressiveness and the strength of the tree r= .363 ( p&lt;. 0.01), a negative correlation was found between boy's aggressiveness and the quantity of apples on the tree r= -.392 ( p&lt;. 0.01). Furthermore, while boys' PPAT was related to motivation, girls' PPAT was related to self-potency. The discussion deals with the possible meanings of the current results, especially in regard to gender differences in PPAT drawings. Replication studies using clinical groups and samples from different cultures will be needed to assess the generalizability of the results and the diagnostic potential of the SC-PPAT/c with clinical populations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902980274&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.aip.2014.05.001&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6e0868fbe449f3898ec6bcc63e4f174f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Y.A.</author><author>Choi, H.J.</author><author>Lee, J.Y.</author><author>Han, B.G.</author><author>Shin, C.S.</author><author>Cho, N.H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication of caucasian loci associated with bone mineral density in Koreans</title><secondary-title>Osteoporosis International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Osteoporosis International</full-title></periodical><pages>2603-2610</pages><volume>24</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00198-013-2354-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Most bone mineral density (BMD) loci were reported in Caucasian genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This study investigated the association between 59 known BMD loci (+200 suggestive SNPs) and DXA-derived BMD in East Asian population with respect to sex and site specificity. We also identified four novel BMD candidate loci from the suggestive SNPs. Introduction: Most GWAS have reported BMD-related variations in Caucasian populations. This study investigates whether the BMD loci discovered in Caucasian GWAS are also associated with BMD in East Asian ethnic samples. Methods: A total of 2,729 unrelated Korean individuals from a population-based cohort were analyzed. We selected 747 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These markers included 547 SNPs from 59 loci with genome-wide significance (GWS, p value less than 5 × 10-8) levels and 200 suggestive SNPs that showed weaker BMD association with p value less than 5 × 10-5. After quality control, 535 GWS SNPs and 182 suggestive SNPs were included in the replication analysis. Results: Of the 535 GWS SNPs, 276 from 25 loci were replicated (p &lt; 0.05) in the Korean population with 51.6 % replication rate. Of the 182 suggestive variants, 16 were replicated (p &lt; 0.05, 8.8 % of replication rate), and five reached a significant combined p value (less than 7.0 × 10-5, 0.05/717 SNPs, corrected for multiple testing). Two markers (rs11711157, rs3732477) are for the same signal near the gene CPN2 (carboxypeptidase N, polypeptide 2). The other variants, rs6436440 and rs2291296, were located in the genes AP1S3 (adaptor-related protein complex 1, sigma 3 subunit) and RARB (retinoic acid receptor, beta). Conclusion: Our results illustrate ethnic differences in BMD susceptibility genes and underscore the need for further genetic studies in each ethnic group. We were also able to replicate some SNPs with suggestive associations. These SNPs may be BMD-related genetic markers and should be further investigated. © 2013 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885423247&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00198-013-2354-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dca89d178802d809090609b09210c538</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Novo, S.M.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Isotherapic for the control of the cattle tick</title><secondary-title>International Journal of High Dilution Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of High Dilution Research</full-title></periodical><pages>165-171</pages><volume>13</volume><number>48</number><issue>48</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Parasitism constitutes one of the major problems that affect the livestock. Commercial acaricides can propitiate drug resistance and residues in the environment and animals. This study aimed to evaluate the control of cattle ticks by using the isotherapics. These drugs were prepared using Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. The dilution and agitations were performed according to the homeopathic pharmacopoeia. By the immersion technique of adults, 50 teleogines were distributed into five treatments: 12cH and 32cH isotherapic, negative control, positive (ivermectin 1%) and vehicle control. The results were evaluated by the rate of mortality, egg production, hatchability rate, estimated reproduction, and the efficacy of the products. In addition, 16 Jersey females cows were subjected to 15mL pour on, of the following treatments: 12cH and 32cH isotherapic and vehicle control. The count of ticks was performed by the simple method on days 0, 15, 21, 42, 63, 84 and 105, post treatments. It was used the Wilcoxon test and Bonferroni method. Both isotherapics treatments showed efficacy at in vitro tests. The 12cH medication presented better results: 10% of mortality rate on the first day of life, maintaining 20% from the second to the 13th day. Additionally, it was observed 20% of egg production, hatching rate of 0.0038% and 99.39% of product effectiveness. However, the in vivo tests showed no satisfactory results for these evaluated conditions, although it was verified a tendency to decreasing the infestation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907963335&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=31ad00531f70f4511109e477964647af</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peñuela, M.M.</author><author>Paternina, A.M.O.</author><author>Robles, V.M.M.</author><author>Casallas, P.E.C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproductive behavior of Alona sp. y Diaphanosoma sp.

Cladocerans are the most used group given their small size, fast development, easy cultivation, susceptibility to predation and high content of digestive enzymes and nutrients. Objective: To determine the reproductive behavior of two native cladoceran species from the Colombian Orinoquia (Alona sp. and Diaphanosoma sp.) in laboratory and under different photoperiod conditions, measuring some reproductive efficiency variables. Materials and methods: Just born individuals were put, individually, in 6 mL. multicell boxes, which were put into isolated cabins with controlled illumination in order to provide light during 0, 6, 12 or 24 hours. 12 replicates of each treatment were performed. Every 6 h and during 15 days in a row, every individual was observed with the microscope in order to determine the presence of eggs or embryos in the incubation chamber and, later, calculate the reproduction variables. Results: No significant differences were found between treatments for the variables evaluated in any of both species. Conclusions: Under the experimental conditions used, it could be seen that the photoperiod has no influence on the reproduction aspects measured in this study for the Alona sp. and Diaphanosoma sp.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905396539&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ae1d78e607a285c6639b1e96a855682d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunderlich, K.</author><author>van der Helm, E.</author><author>Spek, D.</author><author>Vermeulen, M.</author><author>Gecgel, A.</author><author>Pau, M.G.</author><author>Vellinga, J.</author><author>Custers, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An alternative to the adenovirus inverted terminal repeat sequence increases the viral genome replication rate and provides a selective advantage in vitro</title><secondary-title>Journal of General Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of General Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>1574-1584</pages><volume>95</volume><number>PART 7</number><issue>PART 7</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1099/vir.0.064840-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>During the development of human adenovirus 35-derived replication-incompetent (rAd35) vaccine vectors for prevention of infectious diseases, we detected mutations in the terminal 8 nt of the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of rAd35. The switch from the plasmid-encoded sequence 59-CATCATCA-39 to the alternative sequence 59-CTATCTAT-39 in the ITRs was found to be a general in vitro propagation phenomenon, as shown for several vectors carrying different transgenes or being derived from different adenovirus serotypes. In each tested case, the plasmid-encoded ITR sequence changed to exactly the same alternative ITR sequence, 59-CTATCTAT-39. The outgrowth of this alternative ITR version should result from a growth advantage conferred by the alternative ITR sequence. Indeed, replication kinetics studies of rAd35 harbouring either the original or alternative ITR sequence confirmed an increase in replication speed for rAd35 vectors with the alternative ITR sequence. These findings can be applied to generate recombinant adenoviral vectors harbouring the alternative ITR sequence, which will facilitate the generation of genetically homogeneous seed virus batches. Moreover, vector production may be accelerated by taking advantage of the observed improved replication kinetics associated with the alternative ITR sequence.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902682737&amp;doi=10.1099%2fvir.0.064840-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3bcea178dcf9bbed961d328eb50a6bd9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shan, C.</author><author>Li, X.</author><author>Deng, C.</author><author>Shang, B.</author><author>Xu, L.</author><author>Ye, H.</author><author>Yuan, Z.</author><author>Zhang, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development and characterization of West Nile virus replicon expressing secreted Gaussia Luciferase</title><secondary-title>Virologica Sinica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virologica Sinica</full-title></periodical><pages>161-166</pages><volume>28</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12250-013-3332-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We developed a Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporter replicon of West Nile virus (WNV) and used it to quantify viral translation and RNA replication.

In order to perform that process, two conditions are necessary: (a) expert knowledge, which guarantees evaluation reliability; and (b) a tool that formalizes that knowledge. We obtained these objectives by (a) asking a group of 25 international experts to assess the quality of a representative sample of lines, and (b) implementing an artificial neural network (ANN) as a tool for automated selection of the best-generalized line.

Increasingly, the GP community is identifying the need to measure the generalisation performance of the models evolved in symbolic regression, and consequently the need to design operators and methods that promote generalisation. In this paper, we explore the use of bloat control methods as a means of promoting generalisation. The results suggest that bloat control methods effectively reduce the computational requirements of symbolic regression, but do not significantly improve generalisation performance. Additionally, we compare the symbolic regression models traditional machine learning techniques, and find that the traditional methods produce models that generalise more effectively than their GP counterparts, while also using fewer computational resources. The results highlight the importance of contextualising GP performance with methods outside of evolutionary computation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921349076&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-13563-2_42&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c30be6003ff6fe68217310f75932abcc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Y.G.</author><author>Gao, Q.Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The revision of paper surface efficiency and its influences on printing qualities</title><secondary-title>Advanced Materials Research</secondary-title></titles><pages>1743-1746</pages><volume>881-883</volume><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.881-883.1743</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Paper surface efficiency (PSE), a paper property integrating gloss and absorbency, can be used to evaluate color reproduction after the interaction of paper and ink.

The add_my_pet collection of over 300 animal species from most larger phyla, and all chordate classes, shows that this model fits energy data very well. Nine parameters determine nine data points at abundant food: dry/wet weight ratio, age at birth, puberty, death, weight at birth, metamorphosis, puberty, ultimate weight and ultimate reproduction rate. We demonstrate that, given a few other parameters, these nine data points also determine the nine parameters uniquely that are independent of food availability: maturity at birth, metamorphosis and puberty, specific assimilation, somatic maintenance and costs for structure, allocation fraction of mobilised reserve to soma, energy conductance, and ageing acceleration. We provide an efficient algorithm for mapping between data and parameter space in both directions and found expressions for the boundaries of the parameter and data spaces. One of them quantifies the position of species in the supply-demand spectrum, which reflects the internalisation of energetic control. We link eco-physiological properties of species to their position in this spectrum and discuss it in the context of homeostasis. Invertebrates and ray-finned fish turn out to be close to the supply end of the spectrum, while other vertebrates, including cartilaginous fish, have stronger demand tendencies. We explain why birds and mammals up-regulate metabolism during reproduction. We study some properties of the bijection using elasticity coefficients. The properties have applications in parameter estimation and in the analysis of evolutionary constraints on parameter values; the relationship between DEB parameters and data has similarities to that between genotype and phenotype. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897505807&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jtbi.2014.03.025&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=55329ae17d4ec3d9d3ad54574ad50b00</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moore, L.S.</author><author>Stolovicki, E.</author><author>Braun, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Population dynamics of metastable growth-rate phenotypes</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0081671</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Neo-Darwinian evolution has presented a paradigm for population dynamics built on random mutations and selection with a clear separation of time-scales between single-cell mutation rates and the rate of reproduction. Laboratory experiments on evolving populations until now have concentrated on the fixation of beneficial mutations. Following the Darwinian paradigm, these experiments probed populations at low temporal resolution dictated by the rate of rare mutations, ignoring the intermediate evolving phenotypes. Selection however, works on phenotypes rather than genotypes. Research in recent years has uncovered the complexity of genotype-to-phenotype transformation and a wealth of intracellular processes including epigenetic inheritance, which operate on a wide range of time-scales. Here, by studying the adaptation dynamics of genetically rewired yeast cells, we show a novel type of population dynamics in which the intracellular processes intervene in shaping the population structure. Under constant environmental conditions, we measure a wide distribution of growth rates that coexist in the population for very long durations (&gt;100 generations). Remarkably, the fastest growing cells do not take over the population on the time-scale dictated by the width of the growth-rate distributions and simple selection. Additionally, we measure significant fluctuations in the population distribution of various phenotypes: the fraction of exponentially-growing cells, the distributions of single-cell growth-rates and protein content. The observed fluctuations relax on time-scales of many generations and thus do not reflect noisy processes. Rather, our data show that the phenotypic state of the cells, including the growth-rate, for large populations in a constant environment is metastable and varies on time-scales that reflect the importance of long-term intracellular processes in shaping the population structure. This lack of time-scale separation between the intracellular and population processes calls for a new framework for population dynamics which is likely to be significant in a wide range of biological contexts, from evolution to cancer.

However, screening and brief intervention (SBI) for prescription opioid misuse has not been tested in this setting. The goal of this project was to assess pharmacists' attitudes and motivation towards delivering SBI for prescription opioid abuse. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional online survey was administered to pharmacists in Utah and Texas, USA. The survey assessed pharmacists': (1) interest in addressing prescription opioid abuse; (2) beliefs about whether pharmacies may be effective locations to deliver SBI; and (3) potential education or training needs to facilitate SBI service delivery. Results: A total of 739 pharmacists responded to the survey. Despite demographic differences, responses to the survey items were similar between Utah and Texas. The highest levels of agreement for survey subscales indicated that: (1) screening and intervention resources would increase pharmacists' motivation to deliver SBI; (2) pharmacists were interested in helping patients who misuse; and (3) pharmacists possess sufficient opioid knowledge and confidence in practice to address prescription abuse. Roughly half of pharmacists that responded agreed that SBI is a service they should deliver. Conclusion: Pharmacists are interested in helping those who misuse prescription opioids and believe pharmacies may be settings in which SBI services can be tested and delivered. These results require replication to assess if they portray pharmacists' views generally. If replicated, future research could examine methods of screening and intervention in the pharmacy setting for prescription opioid misuse. © 2013 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876880010&amp;doi=10.1111%2fjphs.12013&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=35c027123c414b1c59b5b06d9b942a53</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tosello, G.</author><author>Hansen, H.N.</author><author>Marinello, F.</author><author>Gasparin, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication and dimensional quality control of industrial nanoscale surfaces using calibrated AFM measurements and SEM image processing</title><secondary-title>CIRP Annals - Manufacturing Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CIRP Annals - Manufacturing Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>563-568</pages><volume>59</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cirp.2010.03.141</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Ultra-high precision manufacture of nanoscale structured polymer surfaces poses the highest challenges in terms of tooling and replication.

The eXiT*CBR framework is proposed to support the development of and experimentation with new case-based reasoning (CBR) systems for medical diagnosis. Method: Our framework offers a modular, heterogeneous environment that combines different CBR techniques for different application requirements. The graphical user interface allows easy navigation through a set of experiments that are pre-visualized as plots (receiver operator characteristics (ROC) and accuracy curves). This user-friendly navigation allows easy analysis and replication of experiments. Used as a plug-in on the same interface, eXiT*CBR can work with any data mining technique such as determining feature relevance. Results: The results show that eXiT*CBR is a user-friendly tool that facilitates medical users to utilize CBR methods to determine diagnoses in the field of breast cancer, dealing with different patterns implicit in the data. Conclusions: Although several tools have been developed to facilitate the rapid construction of prototypes, none of them has taken into account the particularities of medical applications as an appropriate interface to medical users. eXiT*CBR aims to fill this gap. It uses CBR methods and common medical visualization tools, such as ROC plots, that facilitate the interpretation of the results. The navigation capabilities of this tool allow the tuning of different CBR parameters using experimental results. In addition, the tool allows experiment reproducibility. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952509718&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.artmed.2010.09.002&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=62338032877f901916521368ebba232b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chang, X.</author><author>Xu, Z.</author><author>Zou, B.</author><author>Zhang, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization bounds of regularization algorithms derived simultaneously through hypothesis space complexity, algorithmic stability and data quality</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wavelets, Multiresolution and Information Processing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wavelets, Multiresolution and Information Processing</full-title></periodical><pages>549-570</pages><volume>9</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1142/S0219691311004213</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A main issue in machine learning research is to analyze the generalization performance of a learning machine. Most classical results on the generalization performance of regularization algorithms are derived merely with the complexity of hypothesis space or the stability property of a learning algorithm. However, in practical applications, the performance of a learning algorithm is not actually affected only by an unitary factor just like the complexity of hypothesis space, stability of the algorithm and data quality. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a framework of evaluating the generalization performance of regularization algorithms combinatively in terms of hypothesis space complexity, algorithmic stability and data quality. We establish new bounds on the learning rate of regularization algorithms based on the measure of uniform stability and empirical covering number for general type of loss functions. As applications of the generic results, we evaluate the learning rates of support vector machines and regularization networks, and propose a new strategy for regularization parameter setting. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960480862&amp;doi=10.1142%2fS0219691311004213&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a68d443e59c1ed43a7ef14b26bb9fe3d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, L.</author><author>Liu, L.</author><author>Che, Y.</author><author>Wang, L.</author><author>Jiang, L.</author><author>Dong, C.</author><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Li, Q.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Egress of HSV-1 capsid requires the interaction of VP26 and a cellular tetraspanin membrane protein</title><secondary-title>Virology Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virology Journal</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1743-422X-7-156</electronic-resource-num><abstract>HSV-1 viral capsid maturation and egress from the nucleus constitutes a self-controlled process of interactions between host cytoplasmic membrane proteins and viral capsid proteins. In this study, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, CTMP-7, was shown to physically interact with HSV-1 protein VP26, and the VP26-CTMP-7 complex was detected both in vivo and in vitro. The interaction of VP26 with CTMP-7 plays an essential role in normal HSV-1 replication. Additionally, analysis of a recombinant virus HSV-1-UG showed that mutating VP26 resulted in a decreased viral replication rate and in aggregation of viral mutant capsids in the nucleus. Together, our data support the notion that biological events mediated by a VP26 - CTMP-7 interaction aid in viral capsid enveloping and egress from the cell during the HSV-1 infectious process. © 2010 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954508585&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1743-422X-7-156&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=959c615ac144c3d7002752482c6a0341</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Briggs, C.W.</author><author>Collopy, M.W.</author><author>Woodbridge, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproduction versus recruitment of swainson's hawks in the Butte Valley, California</title><secondary-title>Condor</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Condor</full-title></periodical><pages>547-554</pages><volume>113</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1525/cond.2011.100174</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Measures of reproductive success have long been assumed to be reasonable surrogates of fitness. We examined reproductive success and recruitment at the individual and population levels in Swainson's Hawks breeding in northern California. At the population level, we investigated whether the number of individuals subsequently recruited could be predicted by the number of offspring produced in any given year, finding no evidence of differences in probability of recruitment by cohort or year. Instead, age of recruits was the best predictor of probability of their being recruited into the local breeding population. At the individual level, we used generalized linear models to examine the correlation between lifetime reproductive success of individual females and the number of their offspring recruited. For individuals, the number of fledglings produced was significantly correlated with both the number of those offspring and of grandchildren recruited into the breeding population. We also examined the relationship between the average annual reproduction of an individual and the number of offspring recruited, finding these significantly correlated. The relationship was not linear: individuals producing moderate numbers of fledglings, on average, yielded the highest numbers of recruits, reflecting a trade-off between adult survival and reproduction. These results provide evidence that monitoring of reproductive success of individuals or a population can give reasonable indices of future recruitment if the study is continued for a long period. But individuals with the highest average rate of reproduction may not be the most fit. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2011.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052382165&amp;doi=10.1525%2fcond.2011.100174&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4de5026bcf40717c6c46c4c21f0b197c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Der Meulen, F.</author><author>De Koning, H.</author><author>De Mast, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nonrepeatable gauge R&amp;R studies assuming temporal or patterned object variation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Quality Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Quality Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>426-439</pages><volume>41</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00224065.2009.11917796</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The standard method to assess a measurement system's precision is a gauge repeatability and reproducibility (gauge R&amp;R) study. It exploits replications to estimate variance components that are interpreted as measurement spread. For nonrepeatable measurements, it is not feasible to obtain replications because objects are destroyed when they are measured or because the object changes over time. Possible solutions are to replace replications with measurements of multiple objects or with the measurement of one object at multiple times. Subsequently, these measurements are modeled by a fixed pattern (over time or over positions). We show that the experimental design used in this type of nonrepeatable gauge R&amp;R studies is best constructed in a way that is similar to a Latin square design. These designs have a great flexibility, can be applied in many situations encountered in practice, and have nice mathematical properties as well. We consider several examples in which this approach is applied and worked out. For the examples given, we provide the analysis and the results following the worked-out approach. Analysis of the envisaged experimental set-up is done with linear and nonlinear mixed models in which variance components are estimated by restricted maximum-likelihood estimators.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70350164117&amp;doi=10.1080%2f00224065.2009.11917796&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c378401691f4059cab96b65947c07cd5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lafforgue, G.</author><author>Sardanyés, J.</author><author>Elena, S.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differences in accumulation and virulence determine the outcome of competition during Tobacco etch virus coinfection</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>6</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0017917</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Understanding the evolution of virulence for RNA viruses is essential for developing appropriate control strategies. Although it has been usually assumed that virulence is a consequence of within-host replication of the parasite, viral strains may be highly virulent without experiencing large accumulation as a consequence of immunopathological host responses. Using two strains of Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that show a negative relationship between virulence and accumulation rate, we first explored the evolution of virulence and fitness traits during simple and mixed infections. Short-term evolution experiments initiated with each strain independently confirmed the genetic and evolutionary stability of virulence and viral load, although infectivity significantly increased for both strains. Second, competition experiments between hypo- and hypervirulent TEV strains have shown that the outcome of competition is driven by differences in replication rate. A simple mathematical model has been developed to analyze the dynamics of these two strains during coinfection. The model qualitatively reproduced the experimental results using biologically meaningful parameters. Further analyses of the model also revealed a wide parametric region in which a low-fitness but hypovirulent virus can still outcompete a high-fitness but hypervirulent one. These results provide additional support to the observation that virulence and within-host replication may not necessarily be strongly tied in plant RNA viruses. © 2011 Lafforgue et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952673687&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0017917&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5c202fbc5099593d3e16ef000f9cfb78</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCrae, R.R.</author><author>Terracciano, A.</author><author>De Fruyt, F.</author><author>De Bolle, M.</author><author>Gelfand, M.J.</author><author>Costa Jr., P.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Validity and Structure of Culture-Level Personality Scores: Data From Ratings of Young Adolescents</title><secondary-title>Journal of Personality</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Personality</full-title></periodical><pages>815-838</pages><volume>78</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00634.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We examined properties of culture-level personality traits in ratings of targets (N=5,109) ages 12 to 17 in 24 cultures.

To date, the impact of escape on viral load and CD4+ T cell count has not been quantified, primarily because of sparse longitudinal data and the difficulty of separating cause and effect in cross-sectional studies. We use two independent methods to quantify the impact of HIV-1 escape from CTLs in chronic infection: mathematical modelling of escape and statistical analysis of a cross-sectional cohort. Mathematical modelling revealed a modest increase in log viral load of 0.051 copies ml-1 per escape event. Analysis of the cross-sectional cohort revealed a significant positive association between viral load and the number of "escape events", after correcting for length of infection and rate of replication. We estimate that a single CTL escape event leads to a viral load increase of 0.11 log copies ml-1 (95% confidence interval: 0.040-0.18), consistent with the predictions from the mathematical modelling. Overall, the number of escape events could only account for approximately 6% of the viral load variation in the cohort. Our findings indicate that although the loss of the CTL response for a single epitope results in a highly statistically significant increase in viral load, the biological impact is modest. We suggest that this small increase in viral load is explained by the small growth advantage of the variant relative to the wildtype virus. Escape from CTLs had a measurable, but unexpectedly low, impact on viral load in chronic infection. © 2010 Kadolsky, Asquith.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78649659194&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pcbi.1000981&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=644ca3d77ba217cbdeedfc693341dfe7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zandi, K.</author><author>Teoh, B.-T.</author><author>Sam, S.-S.</author><author>Wong, P.-F.</author><author>Mustafa, M.</author><author>Abubakar, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antiviral activity of four types of bioflavonoid against dengue virus type-2</title><secondary-title>Virology Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virology Journal</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1743-422X-8-560</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Dengue is a major mosquito-borne disease currently with no effective antiviral or vaccine available. Effort to find antivirals for it has focused on bioflavonoids, a plant-derived polyphenolic compounds with many potential health benefits. In the present study, antiviral activity of four types of bioflavonoid against dengue virus type -2 (DENV-2) in Vero cell was evaluated. Anti-dengue activity of these compounds was determined at different stages of DENV-2 infection and replication cycle. DENV replication was measured by Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) and quantitative RT-PCR. Selectivity Index value (SI) was determined as the ratio of cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) to inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50) for each compound. Results: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of quercetin against dengue virus was 35.7 g mL-1 when it was used after virus adsorption to the cells. The IC50decreased to 28.9 g mL-1 when the cells were treated continuously for 5 h before virus infection and up to 4 days post-infection. The SI values for quercetin were 7.07 and 8.74 g mL-1, respectively, the highest compared to all bioflavonoids studied. Naringin only exhibited anti-adsorption effects against DENV-2 with IC50= 168.2 g mL -1 and its related SI was 1.3. Daidzein showed a weak anti-dengue activity with IC50= 142.6 g mL-1 when the DENV-2 infected cells were treated after virus adsorption. The SI value for this compound was 1.03. Hesperetin did not exhibit any antiviral activity against DENV-2. The findings obtained from Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) were corroborated by findings of the qRT-PCR assays. Quercetin and daidzein (50 g mL-1) reduced DENV-2 RNA levels by 67% and 25%, respectively. There was no significant inhibition of DENV-2 RNA levels with naringin and hesperetin. Conclusion: Results from the study suggest that only quercetin demonstrated significant anti-DENV-2 inhibitory activities. Other bioflavonoids, including daidzein, naringin and hesperetin showed minimal to no significant inhibition of DENV-2 virus replication. These findings, together with those previously reported suggest that select group of bioflavonoids including quercetin and fisetin, exhibited significant inhibitory activities against dengue virus. This group of flavonoids, flavonol, could be investigated further to discover the common mechanisms of inhibition of dengue virus replication. © 2011 Zandi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84455173760&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1743-422X-8-560&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b226bd183ad1e3107dd6d67d9a9f1fea</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hsiao, W.</author><author>Sultan, R.</author><author>Lee, R.</author><author>Goldstein, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increased follicle-stimulating hormone is associated with higher assisted reproduction use after vasectomy reversal</title><secondary-title>Journal of Urology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Urology</full-title></periodical><pages>2266-2271</pages><volume>185</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.juro.2011.02.011</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: Of men with vasectomy 6% elect to have more children. When considering vasectomy reversal vs in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection, an elucidation of preoperative factors that predict surgical success would help determine appropriate management. We tested the hypothesis that preoperative follicle-stimulating hormone 10 U/l or greater predict a lower paternity rate after vasectomy reversal. Materials and Methods: Using preoperative follicle-stimulating hormone levels we retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who underwent vasectomy reversal. Follicle-stimulating hormone was measured in cases suspicious for impaired spermatogenesis. The final analysis included 206 men, who were divided by follicle-stimulating hormone less than 10 U/l (normal in 155) and 10 U/l or greater (high in 51). Nominal logistic regression was performed to evaluate assisted reproduction predictors. Results: Mean ± SD follicle-stimulating hormone in the normal and high groups was 5.1 ± 2.2 and 16.2 ± 6.2 U/l, respectively. Postoperative semen parameters were similar. However, in the high hormone group there was greater use of any type of assisted reproduction (78.4% vs 54.8%, p = 0.0028). On multivariate analysis follicle-stimulating hormone 10 U/l or greater (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.346.83) and vasoepididymostomy that was bilateral or to a solitary testis (OR 3.26, 95% CI 1.099.69) was associated with greater assisted reproduction use. Conclusions: We evaluated preoperative follicle-stimulating hormone as a predictor of reproductive outcome in men with suspected subfertility who underwent vasectomy reversal. Increased follicle-stimulating hormone was associated with a higher rate of assisted reproduction even after controlling for confounding covariates. Thus, men with increased follicle-stimulating hormone should be counseled on the increased likelihood of needing assisted reproduction to achieve pregnancy after vasectomy reversal. © 2011 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955797817&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.juro.2011.02.011&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f5e001dd1a8fe7d9014452bf5f94cc95</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Du, W.-S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Some new results and generalizations in metric fixed point theory</title><secondary-title>Nonlinear Analysis, Theory, Methods and Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nonlinear Analysis, Theory, Methods and Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1439-1446</pages><volume>73</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.na.2010.05.007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The main purpose of this paper is the study of the generalization of some results given in [M.

The infectiousness of inoculated pigs, assessed from the frequency of occurrence of infected pigs in susceptible groups in each contact trial, increased from 4 to 18 DPI (0, 7 and 8 infected pigs at 4, 11 and 18 DPI, respectively) and then decreased slowly until 39 days post infection (4, 2 and 1 pigs infected at 25, 32 and 39 DPI, respectively). The estimated time-dependent infectiousness was fitted to three unimodal function shapes (gamma, Weibull and lognormal) for comparison. The absence of infected pigs at 4 DPI revealed a latency period between 4 and 10 DPI. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test whether the parametric shape of the transmission function influenced the estimations. The estimated time-dependent transmission rate was implemented in a deterministic SEIR model and validated by comparing the model prediction with external data. The lognormal-like function shape evidenced the best quality of fit, leading to a latency period of 8 days, an estimated basic reproduction ratio of 5.9 [1.8,10.1] and a mean disease generation time of 18.4 days [18.2, 18.5]. © 2008 The Royal Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57349167677&amp;doi=10.1098%2frsif.2008.0210&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7bf7d4289b9faa9091c2bdcfd281b939</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Orsel, K.</author><author>Bouma, A.</author><author>Dekker, A.</author><author>Stegeman, J.A.</author><author>de Jong, M.C.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Foot and mouth disease virus transmission during the incubation period of the disease in piglets, lambs, calves, and dairy cows</title><secondary-title>Preventive Veterinary Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive Veterinary Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>158-163</pages><volume>88</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.09.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Transmission of foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus by infected animals may already occur before clinical signs are evident. Quantitative data for FMD transmission rates during this so-called high-risk period are currently lacking and would provide useful information to develop surveillance systems in which the number of new outbreaks is an outcome variable. In order to address this, we used experimental data to quantify transmission in cattle, swine and sheep during the non-clinical phase of the disease. Groups consisted of vaccinated or non-vaccinated animals of one species; half of each group was inoculated with FMDV, the other half was contact-exposed. We estimated the reproduction ratio Rnonclin using a mathematical SIR model. Rnonclin was defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual in its non-clinical phase. Animals not showing clinical signs shed lower amounts of virus than clinically affected ones. Therefore, we estimated transmission proportionally to the virus excretion. Low estimates for Rnonclin in groups with non-vaccinated and vaccinated calves; 0.30 [0.03; 3.43] and 1.03 × 10-8 [0; ∞] respectively and 0.21 [0.02; 2.48] for the non-vaccinated and 0.16 [0.009; 2.96] for the vaccinated lambs, were observed. These results indicate that only few secondary infections are to be expected from infected calves and lambs when they are not clinically affected. In groups of non-vaccinated piglets estimates were Rnonclin = 13.20 [4.08; 42.68], and in vaccinated piglets Rnonclin = 1.26 [0.18; 8.96]. The estimate for Rnonclin for non-vaccinated dairy cows was Rnonclin = 176.65 [80.38; 388.24], whereas Rnonclin in the vaccinated groups could not be estimated. Our findings suggest that a large number of individuals might have been infected before clinical signs are noticed, especially in non-vaccinated swine and dairy herds. These findings suggest that after clinical recognition of FMD, priority should be given to trace back contacts with swine and dairy farms, as they may already have been infectious in the herd's incubation period.

Its aim is to update the Corine land cover database in Europe for the year 2000. Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) satellite images were used for the update and were acquired within the framework of the Image2000 project. Knowledge of the land status through the use of mapping CORINE Land Cover is of great importance to study of interaction land cover and land use categories in Europe scale. This paper presents the accuracy assessment methodology designed and implemented to validate the Iberian Coast CORINE Land Cover 2000 cartography. It presents an implementation of a new methodological concept for land cover data production, Object- Based classification, and automatic generalization to assess the thematic accuracy of CLC2000 by means of an independent data source based on the comparison of the land cover database with reference data derived from visual interpretation of high resolution satellite imageries for sample areas. In our case study, the existing Object-Based classifications are supported with digital maps and attribute databases. According to the quality tests performed, we computed the overall accuracy, and Kappa Coefficient. We will focus on the development of a methodology based on classification and generalization analysis for built-up areas that may improve the investigation. This study can be divided in these fundamental steps: • Extract artificial areas from land use Classifications based on Land-sat and Spot images. • Manuel interpretation for high resolution of multispectral images. • Determine the homogeneity of artificial areas by generalization process. • Overall accuracy, Kappa Coefficient and Special grid (fishnet) test for quality test. Finally, this paper will concentrate to illustrate the precise accuracy of CORINE dataset based on the above general steps. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-71549123713&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.830121&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d700c90f61bfb77509414873cb7c1cff</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boëlle, P.Y.</author><author>Bernillon, P.</author><author>Desenclos, J.C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A preliminary estimation of the reproduction ratio for new influenza A(H1N1) from the outbreak in Mexico, March-April 2009.</title><secondary-title>Euro surveillance : bulletin européen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Euro surveillance : bulletin européen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin</full-title></periodical><volume>14</volume><number>19</number><issue>19</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/ese.14.19.19205-en</electronic-resource-num><abstract>As of 12 May 2009, 5,251 cases of the new influenza A(H1N1) have been officially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 30 countries, with most of the identified cases exported from Mexico where a local epidemic has been going on for the last two months. Sustained human-to-human transmission is necessary to trigger influenza pandemic and estimating the reproduction ratio (average number of secondary cases per primary case) is necessary for forecasting the spread of infection. We use two methods to estimate the reproduction ratio from the epidemic curve in Mexico using three plausible generation intervals (the time between primary and secondary case infection). As expected, the reproduction ratio estimates were highly sensitive to assumptions regarding the generation interval, which remains to be estimated for the current epidemic. Here, we suggest that the reproduction ratio was less than 2.2 - 3.1 in Mexico, depending on the generation interval. Monitoring and updating the reproduction ratio estimate as the epidemic spreads outside Mexico into different settings should remain a priority for assessing the situation and helping to plan public health interventions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67649210939&amp;doi=10.2807%2fese.14.19.19205-en&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=49d4d478188e0d97a3888cfdb615021f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morimoto, S.</author><author>Aoki, S.</author><author>Nakazawa, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High precision measurements of carbon isotopic ratio of atmospheric methane using a continuous flow mass spectrometer</title><secondary-title>Antarctic Record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antarctic Record</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>53</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>A high-precision measurement system for the carbon isotope ratio of atmospheric CH 4 (δ 13CH 4) was developed using a pre-concentration device for CH 4, and a gas chromatograph-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GC-C-IRMS). The measurement system required 100 m/ STP of an atmospheric air sample, corresponding to approximately 0.18 μ l STp of CH 4 to determine the δ 13CH 4 value with a reproducibility of 0.07%o. Replicated analyses of a CH 4-in-air standard gas during the period from 2002 to 2008 indicated that the value of δ BCH 4 measured by this system was consistent within the measurement reproducibility. To evaluate the δ 13CH 4 measurement system, thus developed, diurnal variations of the atmospheric CH 4 concentration and δ 13CH 4 were observed in the northern part of the Tokyo metropolitan area.

Seven successive transmission trials involving a total of 77 specific pathogen-free piglets were carried out from 7 to 63 days post-inoculation (dpi). A semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR was developed to assess the evolution of the viral genome load in blood and nasal swabs from inoculated and contact pigs, with time. Virus genome in blood was detectable in inoculated pigs from 7 to 77 dpi, whereas viral genome shedding was detectable from nasal swabs from 2 to 48 dpi. The infectiousness of inoculated pigs, assessed from the frequency of occurrence of infected pigs in susceptible groups in each contact trial, increased from 7 to 14 dpi and then decreased slowly until 42 dpi (3, 7, 2, 1 and 0 pigs infected at 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 dpi, respectively). These data were used to model the time-dependent infectiousness by a lognormal-like function with a latency period of 1 day and led to an estimated basic reproduction ratio, R0 of 2.6 [1.8, 3.3]. The evolution of infectiousness was mainly correlated with the time-course of viral genome load in the blood whereas the decrease of infectiousness was strongly related to the increase in total antibodies. © 2012 Charpin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84869181935&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1297-9716-43-69&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=67997aa4160201b2cbda7d8ca24141b9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kolesnikova, T.D.</author><author>Demakov, S.A.</author><author>Ivankin, A.V.</author><author>Zhimulev, I.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Molecular combing in studies of the genome organization and DNA replication].</title><secondary-title>Genetika</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genetika</full-title></periodical><pages>1409-1412</pages><volume>46</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Molecular combing (MC) yields preparations where individual DNA molecules are uniformly stretched and are parallel to each other.

Several journals require public data deposition and several public databases exist. However, not all data are publicly available, and even when available, it is unknown whether the published results are reproducible by independent scientists. Here we evaluated the replication of data analyses in 18 articles on microarray-based gene expression profiling published in Nature Genetics in 2005-2006. One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited. More strict publication rules enforcing public data availability and explicit description of data processing and analysis should be considered. © 2009 Nature America, Inc.

A laboratory culture experiment was conducted to evaluate the influences of water temperature on larval development, survival, and reproduction. Results indicate that within a temperature range from 15 to 35°C, larval development increases as the temperature increases. The water temperature for optimal larval survival rate ranges from 20 to 35°C. Longevity and egg hatching time decrease as the temperature increases from 20 to 35°C. Total fecundity and reproduction frequency increase as the water temperature increases, with the maximum at 30°C. Fecundity and reproduction frequency decrease when the temperature exceeds 30°C. Intrinsic growth rate (rm) ranges from 0.168 to 0.195 at 25 to 30°C; net reproduction rate (R0) and finite growth rate (λ) are 163 to 264 and 1.183 to 1.215, respectively, when the temperature is greater than 20 and 35°C; population doubling time (t) varies from 3.556 to 4.128 days at temperatures less than 20 and 35°C.

The transcription factor p63 plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues, including the ocular surface. In an effort to gain insight into the pathogenesis of keratitis caused by HSV-1, we determined the expression patterns of the p63 and Bax proteins in the Staatens Seruminstitute Rabbit Cornea cell line (SIRC). Methods. SIRC cells were infected with HSV-1 at various multiplicities and maintained for different periods of time. Virus replication was measured by indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. The apoptotic response of the infected cells was quantified by ELISA detecting the enrichment of nucleosomes in the cytoplasm. Western blot analysis was used to determine the levels of p63 and Bax proteins. Results. Indirect immunofluorescence assays and Western blot analyses demonstrated the presence of HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) in the infected SIRC cell line, and the pattern of gD expression was consistent with efficient viral replication. The results of MTT and ELISA assays showed that HSV-1 elicited a strong cytopathic effect, and apoptosis played an important role in the demise of the infected cells. Mock-infected SIRC cells displayed the constitutive expression of ΔNp63α. The expressions of the Bax-β and TAp63γ isoforms were considerably increased, whereas the level of ΔNp63α was decreased in the HSV-1-infected SIRC cells. Experiments involving the use of acyclovir showed that viral DNA replication was necessary for the accumulation of TAp63γ. Conclusion. These data suggest that a direct, virus-mediated cytopathic effect may play an important role in the pathogenic mechanism of herpetic keratitis. By disturbing the delicate balance between the pro-survival ΔN and the pro-apoptotic TA isoforms, HSV-1 may cause profound alterations in the viability of the ocular cells and in the tissue homeostasis of the ocular surface. © 2010 Orosz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954230248&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1423-0127-17-47&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=70832706674fc6c5ad52031f44faae70</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Akbulut, B.</author><author>Zengin, M.</author><author>Çiftçi, Y.</author><author>Ustaoǧlu Tiril, S.</author><author>Memiş, D.</author><author>Alkan, A.</author><author>Çakmak, E.</author><author>Kurtoǧlu, I.Z.</author><author>Aydin, I.</author><author>Üstündaǧ, E.</author><author>Eroǧlu, O.</author><author>Serdar, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stimulating sturgeon conservation and rehabilitation measures in Turkey: An overview on major projects (2006-2009)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Ichthyology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Ichthyology</full-title></periodical><pages>415-419</pages><volume>27</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01736.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this report is to provide an overview of the current status of efforts on the potential rehabilitation of sturgeon populations in Turkish waters, describing the structure and the outcome of projects carried out since 2006 and identifying the strategic needs for sturgeon conservation measures at a national level. It is well known that there were six sturgeon species occurring around Turkish Black Sea coasts while entering the rivers, mainly Kizilirmak, Yeşilirmak, Sakarya and Çoruh Rivers for spawning. Anadromous sturgeon species have been strictly protected throughout Turkey since 1997. Conservation and management measurements have been implemented since 1970s. However, this was apparently with little success as stocks continued to decline and habitats deteriorated further, threatening the stocks with extinction. At the same time the needs for survival are not well documented. A project was initiated on 30 January 2006, consisting of seven-work packages including studies on population structure, reproduction, habitat assessment, genetic variability between and within stocks and the development of protective management strategies and plans. The work covered the Turkish Black Sea coastline and the rovers Yeşilirmak, Kizilirmak, Çoruh and Sakarya.

With regard to cancer treatment, replication competent oncolytic adenoviruses have been safe in humans, although their efficacy has been variable. Therefore, more effective agents are now entering clinical testing and, consequently, replication-associated side effects remain a concern. Preclinical analysis of replication related toxicity has been hampered by a lack of permissive models. Therefore, it has been difficult to study modulation of human adenovirus replication in immune competent animals. Methods: We investigated four different hamster carcinoma cell lines for transduction and cell killing potency in vitro and in vivo. Gene transfer was assessed using replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing luciferase. Cell killing was studied in vitro and in vivo using an oncolytic adenovirus that kills tumor cells by viral replication. After the most promising animal model had been selected, abrogation of virus replication was assessed in vitro and in vivo using a TCID50 assay. Results: The results obtained suggest wild-type adenovirus replication in all four tested Syrian hamster cell lines and also normal organs. Virus replication could be abrogated with chlorpromazine, cidofovir and cytosine arabinoside, and the effect occurred subsequent to nuclear delivery of the viral genome. Attenuation of virus replication also was seen in vivo both in tumors and the liver. Conclusions: Syrian hamsters may comprise a valuable immune competent model for evaluating anti-adenoviral drugs. Furthermore, chlorpromazine or cidofovir might be useful in case of adenovirus replication-associated symptoms in humans.

Whole Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or CD8 cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from previously tetanus toxoid (TT)-immunized individuals were activated with TT plus IL-2, and cell proliferation, cytokine production, and in vitro HIV-1 replication were measured. The in vivo magnitude of the humoral immune response was also assessed by antibody measurements. Our results showed that, compared with other groups, both in vitro TT-specific lymphoproliferation and serum antibody concentration were lower in older AIDS patients. Although the IL-1β and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production were higher in cultures from aged HIV-1-infected patients, a dramatic damage on the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release was observed, when compared with younger patients. CD8+ T lymphocytes depletion reduced IL-1β and TNF-α release in the older groups, however, it did not significantly alter their IFN-γ production. Furthermore, the neutralization of endogenous IL-10 did not change the IFN-γ deficiency in older AIDS patients. Finally, the lower cellular immune response in this patient group was not related to in vitro HIV-1 replication. The results suggest that successfully highly active antiretroviral therapy-treated aged AIDS patients do not reconstitute the immune response to TT, making them probably more susceptible to tetanus even after vaccination. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77951690238&amp;doi=10.1097%2fQAI.0b013e3181d6003b&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e9994da61d1ff8d91c3714f8dc14a694</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Das, A.T.</author><author>Harwig, A.</author><author>Berkhout, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The HIV-1 Tat protein has a versatile role in activating viral transcription</title><secondary-title>Journal of Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>9506-9516</pages><volume>85</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JVI.00650-11</electronic-resource-num><abstract>It is generally acknowledged that the Tat protein has a pivotal role in HIV-1 replication because it stimulates transcription from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter by binding to the TAR hairpin in the nascent RNA transcript. However, a multitude of additional Tat functions have been suggested. The importance of these functions is difficult to assess in replication studies with Tat-mutated HIV-1 variants because of the dominant negative effect on viral gene expression. We therefore used an HIV-1 construct that does not depend on the Tat-TAR interaction for transcription to reevaluate whether or not Tat has a second essential function in HIV-1 replication. This HIV-rtTA variant uses the incorporated Tet-On gene expression system for activation of transcription and replicates efficiently upon complete TAR deletion. Here we demonstrated that Tat inactivation does nevertheless severely inhibit replication. Upon long-term culturing, the Tat-minus HIV-rtTA variant acquired mutations in the U3 region that improved promoter activity and reestablished replication. We showed that in the absence of a functional TAR, Tat remains important for viral transcription via Sp1 sequence elements in the U3 promoter region. Substitution of these U3 sequences with nonrelated promoter elements created a virus that replicates efficiently without Tat in SupT1 T cells. These results indicate that Tat has a versatile role in transcription via TAR and U3 elements. The results also imply that Tat has no other essential function in viral replication in cultured T cells. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052452885&amp;doi=10.1128%2fJVI.00650-11&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=958de9f62b2a9e5245d1e587955e4389</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Obermayer, B.</author><author>Frey, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Escalation of error catastrophe for enzymatic self-replicators</title><secondary-title>Europhysics Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Europhysics Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>88</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1209/0295-5075/88/48006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>It is a long-standing question in origin-of-life research whether the information content of replicating molecules can be maintained in the presence of replication errors.

To increase the reliability and accuracy of published papers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes in statistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe that the incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for such reforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality of individual scientists is judged on the basis of their number of publications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbers of citations. Neither of these measures takes into account the replicability of the published findings, as false or controversial results are often particularly widely cited. We propose tracking replications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to help researchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize the publication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires a database linking published studies that replicate one another. Asany such database is limited by the number of replication attempts published, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated to publishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database and the affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination of crowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database are aggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicability scores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate the quality of work published in individual journals. In this paper, we lay out a detailed description of how this system could be implemented, including mechanisms for compiling the information, ensuring data quality, and incentivizing the research community to participate. © 2012 Hartshorne and Schachner.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856770812&amp;doi=10.3389%2ffncom.2012.00008&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6f4f12e021ade8a9dce05ff1c3c37d2b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Y.</author><author>Chastain, P.</author><author>Yap, P.-T.</author><author>Cheng, J.-Z.</author><author>Kaufman, D.</author><author>Guo, L.</author><author>Shen, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automated DNA fiber tracking and measurement</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging</secondary-title></titles><pages>1349-1352</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872650</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The rapid assessment of how cells respond to pathologic, biological, environmental, and endogenous agents is critical for understanding how such responses may increase genomic instability, disease development and, ultimately, affect quality of life. Recently, we have applied the technique of DNA fiber analysis to increase our understanding of how DNA damaging agents influence DNA replication [1]. The major drawback to this technique, however, is the length of time needed to manually assess the replication dynamics, i.e., 40 hours per experimental condition. We introduce in this paper an automatic and effective image analysis framework for accurate quantification of various replication tracks for high throughput DNA analysis, called Computer Assisted Selection and Analysis (CASA). This algorithm is implemented in two major steps: random-walk-based DNA fiber tracking and pattern-recognition-based measurement of the replication tracks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can yield results which are highly consistent with manual analysis and needs only 160-fold less processing time, without manual involvement. © 2011 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80055029446&amp;doi=10.1109%2fISBI.2011.5872650&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f9a9ba04959674d757a95702fc4447ce</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, F.</author><author>Chen, R.</author><author>Zhu, J.</author><author>Sun, D.</author><author>Song, C.</author><author>Wu, Y.</author><author>Ye, M.</author><author>Wang, L.</author><author>Zou, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A fully automated system with online sample loading, Isotope dimethyl labeling and multidimensional separation for high-throughput quantitative proteome analysis</title><secondary-title>Analytical Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytical Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>3007-3015</pages><volume>82</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/ac100075y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Multidimensional separation is often applied for large-scale qualitative and quantitative proteome analysis. A fully automated system with integration of a reversed phase-strong cation exchange (RP-SCX) biphasic trap column into vented sample injection system was devel-oped to realize online sample loading, isotope dimethyl labeling and online multidimensional separation of the proteome samples. Comparing to conventionally manual isotope labeling and off-line fractionation technologies, this system is fully automated and time-saving, which is benefit for improving the quantification reproducibility and accuracy. As phosphate SCX monolith was integrated into the biphasic trap column, high sample injection flow rate and high-resolution stepwise fractionation could be easily achieved. ∼ 1000 proteins could be quantified in ∼30 h proteome analysis, and the proteome coverage of quantitative analysis can be further greatly improved by prolong the multidimensional separation time. This sys-tem was applied to analyze the different protein expression level of HCC and normal human liver tissues. After three times replicated analysis, finally 94 up-regulated and 249 down-regulated (HCC/Normal) proteins were successfully obtained. These significantly regulated proteins are widely validated by both gene and proteins expression studies previously.

Studies in rodent models also suggest that beta cell replication can be induced by certain inflammatory cytokines and by gastrin. We therefore tested the hypothesis that beta cell replication is observed in non-autoimmune human pancreatic disorders in which localised inflammation or elevated gastrin levels are present. Methods: Resected operative pancreatic specimens were obtained from patients diagnosed with primary adenocarcinoma (with or without chronic severe pancreatitis) or gastrinoma. Additional pancreatic tissue was obtained from autopsy control patients. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess fractional insulin area, beta cell number and replication rate and differentiation factors relevant to beta cell development. Results: Fractional insulin area was similar among groups. Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and localised chronic severe pancreatitis displayed significant increases in the number of single beta cells, as well as increased beta cell replication rate and levels of neurogenic differentiation 1 in islets. Patients with gastrinoma demonstrated significant increases in the number of single beta cells, but the beta cell replication rate and islet differentiation factor levels were similar to those in the control group. Conclusions/interpretation: These findings indicate that chronic severe pancreatic inflammation can be associated with significant effects on beta cell number or replication rate, depending on the distribution of the cells. This information may prove useful for attempts seeking to design therapies aimed at inducing beta cell replication as a means of reversing diabetes. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-58149470614&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00125-008-1200-z&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=37e051369355113ae0cd9fb31abb3ae6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Y.</author><author>Hou, Q.</author><author>Cao, Z.</author><author>Liu, Q.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Research on the revision and application of the paper surface efficiency formula</title><secondary-title>Advanced Materials Research</secondary-title></titles><pages>868-872</pages><volume>156-157</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.156-157.868</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Paper surface efficiency (PSE), a paper property integrating gloss and absorbency, can be used to evaluate color reproduction after the interaction of paper and ink.

However, these studies have not reached the same conclusions in regard to the presence, spatial distribution (focal/diffuse), and directionality (elevated/reduced) of FA differences outside of the left perisylvian region. In addition, supplemental DTI measures (axial and radial diffusivities, diffusion trace) have yet to be utilized to examine the potential etiology of these FA reductions. Therefore, the present study sought to reexamine earlier findings through a sex- and age-controlled replication analysis and then to extend these findings with the aforementioned non-FA measures. The replication analysis showed that robust FA reductions in PSs were largely focal, left hemispheric, and within late-myelinating associative and commissural fibers (division III of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, callosal body, forceps minor of the corpus callosum). Additional DTI measures revealed that these FA reductions were attributable to an increase in diffusion perpendicular to the affected fiber tracts (elevated radial diffusivity). These findings suggest a hypothesis that will be testable in future studies: that myelogenesis may be abnormal in PSs within left-hemispheric fiber tracts that begin a prolonged course of myelination in the first postnatal year. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954954048&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.neuroimage.2010.05.011&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=10f90aa1bd8a88d4d58c96c3dd2d8a61</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>El Fakhri, G.</author><author>Kardan, A.</author><author>Sitek, A.</author><author>Dorbala, S.</author><author>Abi-Hatem, N.</author><author>Lahoud, Y.</author><author>Fischman, A.</author><author>Coughlan, M.</author><author>Yasuda, T.</author><author>Di Carli, M.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproducibility and accuracy of quantitative myocardial blood flow assessment with 82Rb PET: Comparison with 13N-ammonia PET</title><secondary-title>Journal of Nuclear Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Nuclear Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1062-1071</pages><volume>50</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2967/jnumed.104.007831</electronic-resource-num><abstract>82Rb cardiac PET allows the assessment of myocardial perfusion with a column generator in clinics that lack a cyclotron. There is evidence that the quantitation of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR) with dynamic 82Rb PET is feasible. The objectives of this study were to determine the accuracy and reproducibility of MBF estimates from dynamic 82Rb PET by using our methodology for generalized factor analysis (generalized factor analysis of dynamic sequences [GFADS]) and compartment analysis. Methods: Reproducibility was evaluated in 22 subjects undergoing dynamic rest and dipyridamole stress 82Rb PET studies at a 2-wk interval. The inter- and intraobserver variability of MBF quantitation with dynamic 82Rb PET was assessed with 4 repeated estimations by each of 4 observers. Accuracy was evaluated in 20 subjects undergoing dynamic rest and dipyridamole stress PET studies with 82Rb and 13N-ammonia, respectively. The left ventricular and right ventricular blood pool and left ventricular tissue time-activity curves were estimated by GFADS. MBF was estimated by fitting the blood pool and tissue time-activity curves to a 2-compartment kinetic model for 82Rb and to a 3-compartment model for 13N-ammonia. CFR was estimated as the ratio of peak MBF to baseline MBF. Results: The reproducibility of the MBF estimates in repeated 82Rb studies was very good at rest and during peak stress (R2 = 0.935), as was the reproducibility of the CFR estimates (R2 = 0.841). The slope of the correlation line was very close to one for the estimation ofMBF(0.986) and CFR (0.960) in repeated 82Rb studies. The intraobserver reliability was less than 3% for the estimation of MBF at rest and during peak stress as well as for the estimation of CFR. The interobserver reliabilities were 0.950 at rest and 0.975 at peak stress. The correlation between myocardial flow estimates obtained at rest and those obtained during peak stress in 82Rb and 13N-ammonia studies was very good (R2 = 0.857). Bland-Altman plots comparing CFR estimated with 82Rb and CFR estimated with 13N-ammonia revealed an underestimation of CFR with 82Rb compared with 13N-ammonia; the underestimation was within ±1.96 SD. Conclusion: MBF quantitation with GFADS and dynamic 82Rb PET demonstrated excellent reproducibility as well as intra- and interobserver reliability. The accuracy of the absolute quantitation of MBF with factor and compartment analyses and dynamic 82Rb PET was very good, compared with that achieved with 13N-ammonia, for MBF of up to 2.5 mL/g/min.

The fresh shark skin was pretreated as a replication sample, and the replication mold of shark skin was manufactured by casting the unsaturated polyester resin under vacuum and laying the multilayer glass fibers. Under vacuum condition, silicone rubber was poured into the resin mold to obtain the replication film of the shark skin with micro-riblets. The contour of the micro-riblet was measured by a Talysurf CLI2000 machine to evaluate the replication accuracy. Based on the contacting angle measurement, the hydrophobic property of the micro-riblet's surface was investigated. It was found that the vacuum casting method was an effective replication technology which was suitable to form large-area and highly accurate micro-riblets on the surface of the shark skin. The experiment of drag reduction was conducted in a water tank. Based on the experimental results, the replicated film of shark skin played a significant role in reducing drag. The maximum and minimum of drag reduction rate were 18.6% and 9.7%, respectively. Copyright © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The project is motivated by numerous experiments that suggest that the behavior of random systems can be altered by directed mental intention, and related experiments showing subtle changes associated with group coherence. Since 1998, the Global Consciousness Project (GCP) has maintained a global network of random number generators (RNGs), recording parallel sequences of random data at 65 sites around the world. A rigorous experiment tests the hypothesis that data from the RNG network will deviate from expectation during times of "global events," defined as transitory episodes of widespread mental and emotional reaction to major world events. An ongoing replication experiment measures correlations across the network during the designated events, and the result from over 345 formal hypothesis tests departs substantially from expectation. A composite statistic for the replication series rejects the null hypothesis by more than six standard deviations. Secondary analyses reveal evidence of a second, independent correlation, as well as temporal and spatial structure in the data associated with the events. Controls exclude conventional physical explanations or experimental error as the source of the measured deviations. The experimental design constrains interpretation of the results: they suggest that some aspect of human consciousness is involved as a source of the effects. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80455131292&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.explore.2011.08.003&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0920eb51374b42526a29c1611b9e709b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Y.-P.</author><author>Lu, Y.-Y.</author><author>Zeng, L.</author><author>Liang, G.-W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Population life parameters and relative fitness of alpharmethrin-resistant Bactrocera dorsalis strain</title><secondary-title>Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>381-386</pages><volume>20</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Based on the observation of the development and reproduction of experimental populations of alpharmethrin-resistant and susceptible Bactrocera dorsalis strains at (28 ± 2) °C, the life tables of the populations were established, and the differences in the relative ecological fitness of the two strains was analyzed. The results showed that comparing with alpharmethrin-susceptible B. dorsalis strain, the resistant one had longer durations of development stages, average generation, and previposition, its fecundity was not stable and lower, and the hatch of eggs and the emergence of adults were depressed. The fecundity of the susceptible and resistant strains was 324.0 and 240.7, respectively. Based on the life tables, the population trend index (I) of resistant strain was 79.10, while that of susceptible strain was 116.97. The net reproduction rate (R0) and the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) of resistant strain were 1414.00 and 7.9463, while those of susceptible strain were 2184.00 and 8.3809, respectively.

Three experiments were conducted: in the first experiment, replication of rHVT-LT vaccine was chronologically evaluated and compared with the replication of herpesvirus of turkey (HVT) in SPF chickens; in the second experiment, the effect of different in ovo vaccination procedures on rHVT-LT vaccine replication was evaluated in SPF chickens; and in the third experiment, the effect of different in ovo vaccination procedures on rHVT-LT vaccine replication was evaluated in commercial broiler chickens with maternal antibodies against HVT and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (LTV). rHVT-LT vaccine replicated in chickens after in ovo (ED 18 and ED 19) or s.c. administration at a similar level. In vivo replication of rHVT-LT vaccine was slower than HVT vaccine. However, in vivo both rHVT-LT and HVT vaccines replicated at similar levels. Both vaccines were consistently detected in the spleen and feather pulp and at lower frequency in the lung. The frequency of samples with detectable levels of rHVT-LT DNA was lower in broiler chickens than in SPF chickens, probably due to interactions with maternal antibodies. Differences between SPF chickens and broiler chickens were found also in the transcription of the LTV glycoprotein I gene (gI). In SPF chickens, in ovo inoculation resulted in a higher number of spleen samples with detectable gI transcripts than s.c. inoculation. In broiler chickens, however, no differences in the level of gI transcripts in spleen samples were found between chickens vaccinated in ovo and those vaccinated by the s.c. route. Transcription of LTV gI gene in lung samples was very low in both SPF and broiler chickens. Further studies to evaluate the mucosal immune response elicited by rHVT-LT in chicken with and without maternal antibodies are warranted. © 2011 Houghton Trust Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79961146995&amp;doi=10.1080%2f03079457.2011.588196&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=50e8b08790e8e7c679f1dc74b38f55db</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Strzetelski, J.A.</author><author>Kowalski, Z.M.</author><author>Kowalczyk, J.</author><author>Borowiec, F.</author><author>Osiȩgłowski, S.</author><author>Ślusarczyk, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protected methionine as a methyl-group donor for dairy cows fed diets with different starch sources in the transition period</title><secondary-title>Journal of Animal and Feed Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Animal and Feed Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>28-41</pages><volume>18</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.22358/jafs/66364/2009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Protected methionine (Smartamine™; 0, 15 or 30 g d-1) was supplemented to rations containing a high proportion of starch easily (barley) or slowly (maize) fermented in the rumen, fed to preand postpartum dairy cows to study its effect on milk yield and composition, metabolic profile and reproduction. The experiment was carried out on 24 Polish Holstein-Friesian cows, divided 21 days before expected parturition into 3 groups of 8 animals and fed individually. Protected methionine was added to the rations from day 21 before, until 21 day after parturition, but the performance of cows was controlled up to the end of week 12 of lactation. Protected methionine had no effect on milk yield and composition, metabolic profile, body weight, body condition score, or reproduction indices. Methionine supplementation increased feed intake before parturition (P&lt;0.01) and blood glucose concentration before parturition and on day 2 after calving (P&lt;0.03 and P&lt;0.01, respectively). The starch source had no influence on the studied parameters. There was also no statistically significant interaction between the level of protected methionine supplementation and starch sources. These results do not support the hypothesis that feeding cows increased amounts of starch digested in the small intestine together with protected methionine can lower energy deficiency and mobilization of energy reserves as well as decrease liver lipidosis by increasing the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67649111081&amp;doi=10.22358%2fjafs%2f66364%2f2009&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=921d970cbd318eca37025dde28359372</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sato, A.</author><author>Sakaguchi, H.</author><author>Ito, H.</author><author>Koyama, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of replication properties on molded surface by ultrasonic injection molding system</title><secondary-title>Annual Technical Conference - ANTEC, Conference Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><pages>1301-1305</pages><volume>3</volume><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>An ultrasonic injection molding (UIM) system, which applies ultrasonic waves to injection molding, as a precision injection molding technology was developed.

As a result, the replication ratio of molded surface was significantly improved in UIM compared with that in conventional molding. The replication ratio increased when the ultrasonic wave was applied immediately after the resin filled in a cavity. Results showed that, by applying ultrasonic waves, oscillatory flow was generated inside the cavity and consequently the surface replication was increased.

However, NAbs could potentially contribute indirectly to the control of HIV-1 if changes in the viral envelope coinciding with NAb escape would impair viral replication fitness. Here we analyzed the replication kinetics of HIV-1 isolated over the course of infection from five typical progressors, three of whom developed strong autologous neutralizing humoral immunity. Viral replication rate did not correlate with viral sensitivity to autologous serum neutralization or with envelope length or number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120, suggesting that the flexibility of the viral envelope allows escape from NAbs without the loss of viral fitness. Interestingly, the appearance of rapidly replicating viruses late in infection correlated with lower CD4+ T-cell counts, suggesting that this viral characteristic may be positively selected when the availability of target cells becomes limiting. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is still unclear whether these loci identified in the Caucasian GWA studies also exert the same effect on lipid concentrations in the Chinese population. Methods and Results: We conducted a replication study assessing associations between SNPs at 15 loci and blood lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in two Chinese cohorts, comprising 2533 and 2105 individuals respectively. SNPs in APO(A1/C3/A4/A5), TIMD4-HAVCR1, DOCK7, TRIB1, ABCA1, and TOMM40-APOE showed strong associations with at least one lipids trait, and rs174546 in FADS1/2/3 showed modest association with triglyceride in the Chinese population. Conclusions: We successfully replicated 7 loci associated plasma lipid concentrations in the Chinese population. Our study confirmed the implication of APO(A1/C3/A4/A5), TOMM40-APOE, ABCA1, DOCK7, TIMD4-HAVCR1, TRIB1 and FADS1/2 in plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in Chinese population. © 2011 Zhang et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80455168398&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0027305&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=76237be80a09871e8832c2b9462503a5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Y.</author><author>Jiao, L.</author><author>Liu, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analyzing the effects of scale and land use pattern metrics on land use database generalization indices</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation</full-title></periodical><pages>346-356</pages><volume>13</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jag.2011.01.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The generalization index system is one of the critical issues for computer-aided land use database generalization. This paper studies the scale and land use pattern effects on land use database generalization indices and estimates the thresholds of these indices based on a typical land use database sample. The index system of land use database generalization is discussed and constructed from macro and micro perspectives. Six land use pattern metrics, namely, land use diversity index, land use dominance index, land use homogeneity index, land use fragmentation index, the index of land use type dominance, and the index of land use type fragmentation, are designed to characterize land use patterns and are introduced into the analysis of land use pattern effect on land use database indices. The analysis framework of the scale and land use pattern effects on the land use database indices are proposed by employing statistical techniques. Based on the land use database samples at multiple spatial scales collected in various land use regions across China, the study generates rules for both scale and land use pattern effects on the indices, including map area proportion of land use types, total map load, parcel map load, and minimum parcel area. The thresholds of these indices in land use database generalization are produced at the scales of 1:50,000, 1:100,000, 1:250,000, and 1:500,000. An experimental generalization at county level demonstrates how to determine the generalization index values considering scale and land use pattern, and how to evaluate the generalization results using our macro indices. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955578138&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jag.2011.01.002&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=46f8d32eaa85b805dfef8383a4829071</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirunworakit, S.</author><author>Petrot, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Some fixed point theorems for contractive multi-valued mappings induced by generalized distance in metric spaces</title><secondary-title>Fixed Point Theory and Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fixed Point Theory and Applications</full-title></periodical><volume>2011</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1687-1812-2011-78</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The purpose of this paper is to prove some existence theorems for fixed point problem by using a generalization of metric distance, namely u-distance.

We also discuss our experiences (in terms of pros and cons) during the replication. © 2012 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858016014&amp;doi=10.1109%2fRESER.2011.8&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=50c6cc9f5e87dcc8de601ec665461818</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Estrin, I.</author><author>Goetz, R.</author><author>Hellerstein, D.J.</author><author>Bennett-Staub, A.</author><author>Seirmarco, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting falls among psychiatric inpatients: A case-control study at a state psychiatric facility</title><secondary-title>Psychiatric Services</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychiatric Services</full-title></periodical><pages>1245-1250</pages><volume>60</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1176/ps.2009.60.9.1245</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: The purpose of the study was to add to the research on risk of falling in an understudied population of psychiatric inpatients in an acute setting. Methods: Five years of fall data in an inpatient psychiatric facility, where falls were frequent but benign, were examined for patient and treatment characteristics that might be associated with falls. This was a retrospective analysis, which matched 1:1 the medical records of fallers and nonfallers on primary psychiatric diagnoses. The total sample consisted of 148 patients. Statistical analysis was conducted on patient demographic characteristics, summed medical history items reported, summed physical complaints on the day of the fall, the number and types of medications taken within a 24-hour period of the fall, and the patient's vital signs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the most salient associations with faller status. Results: Univariate analyses revealed that fallers were prescribed significantly more medications and complained of more physical symptoms on the day of their fall. Fallers were more likely to have a current acute medical condition and to be currently prescribed clonazepam or antihypertensive medication. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that current physical complaints and current clonazepam treatment had significant associations with faller status. Conclusions: Risk factors identified in this study should be assessed in replication studies. Psychiatric clinicians can use such risk factors to create evidence-based fall prevention programs.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-69949109621&amp;doi=10.1176%2fps.2009.60.9.1245&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2501b6772fba2a324e40e2826bae5650</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kolesnikova, T.D.</author><author>Demakov, S.A.</author><author>Ivankin, A.V.</author><author>Zhimulev, I.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular combing in studies of the genome organization and DNA replication</title><secondary-title>Russian Journal of Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Russian Journal of Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1243-1246</pages><volume>46</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1134/S102279541010025X</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Molecular combing (MC) yields preparations where individual DNA molecules are uniformly stretched and are parallel to each other.

Patterns of oviposition are often inferred only indirectly, through monitoring of host infestation, whereas the influence of age structure and several other factors on oviposition remains unknown. Using a new approach, in this article, we live-trapped wild Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) females on the Greek island of Chios during two field seasons. For their remaining lifetime, these females were placed individually in small cages and their daily oviposition was monitored. Reproduction rates between cohorts from different collection dates were then compared. The results showed that in the different captive cohorts the average remaining lifetime and reproduction were highly variable within and between seasons. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the month of capture had a significant effect on captive life span, average daily reproduction, and patterns of egg laying. The effect of year was significant on reproduction, but not on captive life span. These differences between sampling periods probably reflect differences in the availability of hosts and other factors that vary during the season and affect age structure and reproduction. Using a non-parametric generalized additive model, we found a statistically significant correlation between the captive life span and the average daily reproduction. These findings and the experimental approach have several important implications. © 2011 The Authors.

Previous psychophysical studies have concluded that postadaptation generalization is restricted to a narrow range of directions around the training direction. A population-coding model that updates the weights between narrow Gaussian-tuned visual units and motor units on each trial reproduced experimental trial-by-trial learning curves for rotation adaptation and the generalization function measured postadaptation. These results suggest that the neurons involved in rotation adaptation have a relatively narrow directional tuning width (∼23°). Population coding models with units having broader tuning functions (such as cosine tuning in motor cortex and Gaussian sum in the cerebellum) could not reproduce the narrow single-peaked generalization pattern. Visually selective neurons with narrow Gaussian tuning curves have been identified in posterior parietal cortex, making it a possible site of adaptation to visuomotor rotation. We propose that rotation adaptation proceeds through changes in synaptic weights between neurons in posterior parietal cortex and motor cortex driven by a prediction error computed by the cerebellum.

Replication properties of the microstructure of the moulded surface were evaluated by the UIM system. In particular, the effects of oscillation conditions on the replication ratio of the moulded surface were investigated. As a result, the replication ratio of the moulded surface was significantly improved in UIM compared with that in conventional moulding. The replication ratio increased when the ultrasonic wave was applied immediately after the resin was filled in a cavity. Results showed that, by applying ultrasonic waves, oscillatory flow was generated inside the cavity and consequently the surface replication was increased.

Sequencing studies can examine potential causal SNPs directly; however, sequencing the whole genome or exome can be prohibitively expensive. Costs can be limited by using a GWAS to detect the associated region(s) at tag SNPs followed by targeted sequencing to identify and estimate the effect size of the causal variant. Genetic effect estimates obtained from association studies can be inflated because of a form of selection bias known as the winners curse. Conversely, estimates at tag SNPs can be attenuated compared to the causal SNP because of incomplete linkage disequilibrium. These two effects oppose each other. Analysis of rare SNPs further complicates our understanding of the winners curse because rare SNPs are difficult to tag and analysis can involve collapsing over multiple rare variants. In two-stage analysis of Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 simulated data sets, we find that selection at the tag SNP produces upward bias in the estimate of effect at the causal SNP, even when the tag and causal SNPs are not well correlated. The bias similarly carries through to effect estimates for rare variant summary measures. Replication studies designed with sample sizes computed using biased estimates will be under-powered to detect a disease-causing variant. Accounting for bias in the original study is critical to avoid discarding disease-associated SNPs at follow up. © 2011 Faye and Bull; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-82455199377&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1753-6561-5-S9-S64&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a2a36eb3803c247badab1f9b8e5933dc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Y.</author><author>Wang, J.</author><author>Gu, S.</author><author>Liu, Z.</author><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Zhang, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simultaneous determination of flavonoids in different parts of citrus reticulata 'Chachi' fruit by high performance liquid chromatography - Photodiode array detection</title><secondary-title>Molecules</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecules</full-title></periodical><pages>5378-5388</pages><volume>15</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/molecules15085378</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Flavonoids are important polyphenolic secondary metabolites in plant. Citrus reticulata 'Chachi' fruit are rich in flavonoids and are being used as functional antioxidant ingredients for the treatment of atherosclerosis and cancer, etc. A high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection system was used to analyze five flavonoids, namely, naringin, hesperidin, didymin, tangeretin and nobiletin, in different parts of C. reticulata 'Chachi' fruit. The chromatographic analysis was performed on a C18 column with a gradient elution of acetonitrile and water at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Detection was carried out using a photodiode array detector at 280 nm. The calibration curves for the determination of all analytes showed good linearity over the investigated ranges (R2 &gt; 0.9995). Precision and reproducibility were evaluated by six replicated analyses, and the R.S.D. values were less than 0.9% and 2.7%. The recoveries were between 98.37 and 103.89%.

Laboratory and field studies (three replications each) evaluated lactic acid efficacy as a chlorine alternative. For the laboratory study, retail-purchased, conventionally processed chicken wings inoculated with Salmonella were randomly assigned to the following treatments: Salmonella inoculation followed by no treatment (10 wings) or by 3-min rinses of water, 50 to 100 ppm of chlorine, or 2% lactic acid (20 wings for each rinse treatment). Wings were sampled for Salmonella enumeration on xylose lysine desoxycholate agar. During pastured poultry processing at mobile slaughter units for each field study replication 20 chicken carcasses were randomly assigned to each treatment: untreated control or 3-min immersion in lactic acid or chlorine. Whole-carcass rinses were examined for aerobic plate count (APC) on tryptic soy agar and coliforms on violet red bile agar. Untreated controls were also examined for Salmonella. in the laboratory study, lactic acid produced a significant (P &lt; 0.01) Salmonella reduction compared with the inoculated no-rinse, water, and chlorine treatments, which were statistically similar to each other. in the field study, no Salmonella was detected on untreated controls. Lactic acid produced significant .2-log (P &lt; 0.01) reductions in APC and coliforms, whereas chlorine resulted in slight but significant 0.4- log reductions (P &lt; 0.01) and 0.21-log reductions (P &lt; 0.05) in APC and coliforms compared with untreated controls. Considering laboratory and field studies, lactic acid produced greater reductions in Salmonella, APC, and coliforms, validating its effectiveness as a chlorine alternative in mobile poultry slaughter operations.

To recognize the tiny cuttings' lithology category effectively, a digital compact system based on high-resolution color linear CCD and microphotography is established and introduced in this paper. The system is mainly constructed by high resolution color linear CCD, micro lens, white LED light sources and conveyor. The Color linear CCD with up to 4080 pixels per line combined with micro lens leads to a resultant reproduction ratio of 1:1. It ensures that tiny cuttings' images can be captured clearly, and hence the detailed information of cuttings' color and texture can be obtained. With the linear scanning, we can get images with both high-resolution and larger field of view than array CCD. Optimal parameter configuration is determined by the experiments of hardware control program and optical parameter adjustment. The software to recognize cuttings' lithology category is developed by extracting multi-character values from the image information and by using the LIBSVM classifier. With the optimal parameter configuration and the developed recognition software, the cuttings' lithology category has been well described with a average recognition rate about 95% for mudstones and about 90% for sandstones, which proves that the cuttings' images captured by the high-resolution linear CCD meet the requirement of the subsequent recognition algorithm. The obtained results show that the digital compact system is greatly potential to be used in oil field logging. © 2009 SPIE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-73849119270&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.838180&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8dfd8928e38662a8b0aad30ab12235b5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cseresnyes, Z.</author><author>Schwarz, U.</author><author>Green, C.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of replication factories in human cells by super-resolution light microscopy</title><secondary-title>BMC Cell Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Cell Biology</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2121-10-88</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: DNA replication in human cells is performed in discrete sub-nuclear locations known as replication foci or factories. These factories form in the nucleus during S phase and are sites of DNA synthesis and high local concentrations of enzymes required for chromatin replication. Why these structures are required, and how they are organised internally has yet to be identified. It has been difficult to analyse the structure of these factories as they are small in size and thus below the resolution limit of the standard confocal microscope. We have used stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, which improves on the resolving power of the confocal microscope, to probe the structure of these factories at sub-diffraction limit resolution. Results: Using immunofluorescent imaging of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and RPA (replication protein A) we show that factories are smaller in size (approximately 150 nm diameter), and greater in number (up to 1400 in an early S- phase nucleus), than is determined by confocal imaging. The replication inhibitor hydroxyurea caused an approximately 40% reduction in number and a 30% increase in diameter of replication factories, changes that were not clearly identified by standard confocal imaging. Conclusions: These measurements for replication factory size now approach the dimensions suggested by electron microscopy. This agreement between these two methods, that use very different sample preparation and imaging conditions, suggests that we have arrived at a true measurement for the size of these structures. The number of individual factories present in a single nucleus that we measure using this system is greater than has been previously reported. This analysis therefore suggests that each replication factory contains fewer active replication forks than previously envisaged. © 2009 Cseresnyes et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950346675&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1471-2121-10-88&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=07ba5c3dae28f65d884b87e8f081fdf1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Inada, A.</author><author>Inada, O.</author><author>Fujii, H.</author><author>Akashi, T.</author><author>Sueishi, K.</author><author>Fukatsu, A.</author><author>Nagafuchi, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Different effects of islet transplantation and Detemir treatment on the reversal of streptozotocin-induced diabetes associated with β-cell regeneration</title><secondary-title>Diabetology International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Diabetology International</full-title></periodical><pages>49-59</pages><volume>1</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s13340-010-0005-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Here we examined whether new β-cell formation occurs when β cells face being severely destroyed and hyperglycemia is restored. Animals were made diabetic by a single i. p. injection of a high dose of streptozotocin, and blood glucose levels were kept in the normal range with twice-daily Detemir (long-acting human insulin analog) injection or islet transplantation for 10 weeks. Although Detemir injection could effectively reverse hyperglycemia and glycemic control was successful, there was no β-cell increase, new formation, or recovery of islet morphology in Detemir-treated mice. In contrast, β-cell regeneration was restored when hyperglycemia was reversed by islet transplantation. The number of β cells and islets was increased, and islet structure was greatly recovered. We further evaluated whether replication or new formation contributes to the recovery. Newly born β cells, as observed as scattered singlets-doublets of insulin-positive cells or clusters of less than 6 β cells across, were frequently seen in transplanted mice, suggesting that neogenesis of β cells was enhanced in transplanted mice. Ki67-positive islets were increased in transplanted mice, suggesting that β-cell proliferation is enhanced. Thus, this recovery involved both increased new formation and replication.

Location: The fire-prone Fynbos biome (Cape Floristic Region, South Africa). Methods: Our process-based models have a spatially explicit demographic submodel (describing dispersal, reproduction, mortality and local extinction) as well as an observation submodel (describing imperfect detection of individuals), and are constrained by species-specific predictions of habitat distribution models and process-based models for seed dispersal by wind. Free model parameters were varied to find parameter sets with the highest likelihood. After testing this approach with simulated data, we applied it to eight Proteaceae species that differ in breeding system (monoecy versus dioecy) and adult fire survival. We assess the importance of Allee effects and negative density dependence for range dynamics, by using the Akaike information criterion to select between alternative models fitted for the same species. Results: The best model for all dioecious study species included Allee effects, whereas this was true for only one of four monoecious species. As expected, sprouters (in which adults survive fire) were estimated to have lower rates of reproduction and catastrophic population extinction than related non-sprouters. Overcompensatory population dynamics seem important for three of four non-sprouters. We also found good quantitative agreement between independent data and most estimates of reproduction, carrying capacity and extinction probability. Main conclusions: This study shows that process-based models can quantitatively describe how large-scale abundance distributions arise from the movement and interaction of individuals. It stresses links between the life history, demography and range dynamics of Proteaceae: dioecious species seem more susceptible to Allee effects which reduce migration ability and increase local extinction risk, and sprouters seem to have high persistence of established populations, but their low reproduction limits habitat colonization and migration. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-72449198479&amp;doi=10.1111%2fj.1466-8238.2009.00492.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b3a95987467c513ab646d6cab0e1082c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hira, S.-I.</author><author>Wang, Z.</author><author>Yoshioka, M.</author><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Nobukawa, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Study on replication of micro channel structures onto polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substrate employing two-stage hot embossing</title><secondary-title>Advanced Materials Research</secondary-title></titles><pages>526-531</pages><volume>76-78</volume><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.76-78.526</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replication of micro structures on a polymer substrate employing two-stage hot embossing is described in this paper. Linear channels with rectangular cross section were fabricated on a master mold of a brass plate by means of a computer numerical control (CNC) machining center using a micro end mill. In the first embossing process, the master mold with concavity features was embossed on a polycarbonate (PC) plate in order to make a "polymer replication mold". Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was chosen as a material of polymer substrate used in the second embossing process. The replicated structure on PTFE substrate was observed and each dimension of its cross-sectional shape was also measured in order to assess the replication accuracy. According to the results, it was found that the depth of a replicated channel was near 90 % of that on the master mold. But roundness at each corner could be also found due to the insufficiency of plastic flow. Furthermore the deformation of the structures on a replication mold of PC before and after 2nd hot embossing process was alsoexamined. As a result, it was found that the deformation ratio at temperatures below 145 °C was roughly smaller than 10 %.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-73949110648&amp;doi=10.4028%2fwww.scientific.net%2fAMR.76-78.526&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c72cc2af699aad5a5efebef4f187a6d9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lobo, H.</author><author>Alves, R.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of body weight and substrate granulometry on the reproduction of Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri (Oligochaeta: Naididae: Tubificinae)</title><secondary-title>Zoologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zoologia</full-title></periodical><pages>558-564</pages><volume>28</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/S1984-46702011000500002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri Claparede, 1862 is a cosmopolitan Oligochaeta widely used as indicator of organic pollution in water bodies. Previous contributions have shown the effects of organic matter and temperature on the life history of the species, although very little is known about the factors that influence its reproduction. This study aimed 1) to test whether the larger weight of individuals results in an increase in the reproduction rate and 2) to test the influence of two granulometric fractions of sand on the reproduction and growth the species. In the first experiment, specimens of L. hoffmeisteri were separated in two groups with different average weights (small individuals = 6.63 ± 1.28 mg; large individuals = 12.44 ± 3.99 mg) and kept at 15 ± 1°C for 21 days. The results of this experiment showed that the number of cocoons was statistically similar between the groups, but the mean number of eggs per cocoon produced by large individuals (2.78 ± 0.35) was greater than that produced by small individuals (7.45 ± 2.50). In the second experiment, weekly observations were conducted for 25 weeks in two groups of 30 specimens: one kept in fine sand and the other in medium sand, at 25 ± 1°C. The single significant difference was in the number of cocoons per adult per day (0.37 ± 0.22 and 0.23 ± 0.24, for fine and medium sand, respectively). Individuals reared in fine sand produced a greater number of descendants compared to those reared in medium sand in the same period of time. © 2011 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-82255167294&amp;doi=10.1590%2fS1984-46702011000500002&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fdf8f11dc2262ff012d716414cb1109b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boone-Heinonen, J.</author><author>Evenson, K.R.</author><author>Song, Y.</author><author>Gordon-Larsen, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Built and socioeconomic environments: Patterning and associations with physical activity in U.S. adolescents</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1479-5868-7-45</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Inter-relationships among built and socioeconomic environmental characteristics may result in confounding of associations between environment exposure measures and health behaviors or outcomes, but traditional multivariate adjustment can be inappropriate due to collinearity.Methods: We used principal factor analysis to describe inter-relationships between a large set of Geographic Information System-derived built and socioeconomic environment measures for adolescents in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Wave I, 1995-96, n = 17,294). Using resulting factors in sex-stratified multivariate negative binomial regression models, we tested for confounding of associations between built and socioeconomic environment characteristics and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Finally, we used knowledge gained from factor analysis to construct replicable environmental measures that account for inter-relationships and avoid collinearity.Results: Using factor analysis, we identified three built environment constructs [(1) homogenous landscape; 2) development intensity with high pay facility count; 3) development intensity with high public facility count] and two socioeconomic environment constructs [1) advantageous economic environment, 2) disadvantageous social environment]. In regression analysis, confounding of built environment-MVPA associations by socioeconomic environment factors was stronger than among built environment factors. In fully adjusted models, MVPA was negatively associated with the highest (versus lowest) quartile of homogenous land cover in males [exp(coeff) (95% CI): 0.91 (0.86, 0.96)] and intensity (pay facilities) [exp(coeff) (95% CI): 0.92 (0.85, 0.99)] in females. Single proxy measures (Simpson's diversity index, count of pay facilities, count of public facilities, median household income, and crime rate) representing each environmental construct replicated associations with MVPA.Conclusions: Environmental characteristics are inter-related. Both built and SES environments should be incorporated into analysis in order to minimize confounding. Single environmental measures may be useful proxies for environmental constructs in longitudinal analysis and replication in external populations, but more research is needed to better understand mechanisms of action, and ultimately identify policy-relevant environmental determinants of physical activity. © 2010 Boone-Heinonen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952402367&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1479-5868-7-45&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9aa57dd26d3aa612cb0e788c810bdf8c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Kuyl, A.C.</author><author>Kozaczynska, K.</author><author>Ariën, K.K.</author><author>Gali, Y.</author><author>Balázs, V.R.</author><author>Dekker, S.J.</author><author>Zorgdrager, F.</author><author>Vanham, G.</author><author>Berkhout, B.</author><author>Cornelissen, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of infectious virus clones from two HIV-1 superinfection cases suggests that the primary strains have lower fitness</title><secondary-title>Retrovirology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Retrovirology</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1742-4690-7-60</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Two HIV-1 positive patients, L and P, participating in the Amsterdam Cohort studies acquired an HIV-1 superinfection within half a year from their primary HIV-1 infection (Jurriaans et al., JAIDS 2008, 47:69-73). The aim of this study was to compare the replicative fitness of the primary and superinfecting HIV-1 strains of both patients. The use of isolate-specific primer sets indicated that the primary and secondary strains co-exist in plasma at all time points after the moment of superinfection.Results: Biological HIV-1 clones were derived from peripheral blood CD4 + T cells at different time point, and identified as the primary or secondary virus through sequence analysis. Replication competition assays were performed with selected virus pairs in PHA/IL-2 activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) and analyzed with the Heteroduplex Tracking Assay (HTA) and isolate-specific PCR amplification. In both cases, we found a replicative advantage of the secondary HIV-1 strain over the primary virus. Full-length HIV-1 genomes were sequenced to find possible explanations for the difference in replication capacity. Mutations that could negatively affect viral replication were identified in the primary infecting strains. In patient L, the primary strain has two insertions in the LTR promoter, combined with a mutation in the tat gene that has been associated with decreased replication capacity. The primary HIV-1 strain isolated from patient P has two mutations in the LTR that have been associated with a reduced replication rate. In a luciferase assay, only the LTR from the primary virus of patient P had lower transcriptional activity compared with the superinfecting virus.Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest the interesting scenario that superinfection occurs preferentially in patients infected with a relatively attenuated HIV-1 isolate. © 2010 van der Kuyl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954662069&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1742-4690-7-60&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a3d7a62c66f97861fdc402dbf1365a2c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peled, M.</author><author>Shaish, A.</author><author>Katav, A.</author><author>Greenberger, S.</author><author>Barshack, I.</author><author>Tal, R.</author><author>Bangio, L.</author><author>Breitbart, E.</author><author>Harats, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systemic administration of a conditionally replicating adenovirus, targeted to angiogenesis, reduced lung metastases burden in cotton rats</title><secondary-title>Clinical Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1664-1673</pages><volume>15</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1670</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: Angiogenesis is an essential process for solid tumor development. To interfere with angiogenesis, AdPPE3x-E1, an adenovirus that is transcriptionally targeted to replicate in angiogenic endothelial cells, was constructed, by replacing the E1 promoter with the modified preproendothelin-1 promoter, PPE-1-3x, previously shown to induce specific transcription in angiogenic endothelial cells. Experimental Design: The specificity of AdPPE3x-E1 to endothelial cells was shown by quantitative PCR and immunostaining, and its antiangiogenic effect was evaluated in Matrigel models. The in vivo efficacy of AdPPE3x-E1 was also tested in a cotton rat lung metastases model. Results: The replication rate ofAdPPE3x-E1 in endothelial cells was similar to that of AdCMV-E1, a nonselective replicating adenovector, but the replication rate was reduced up to 60-fold in nonendothelial cells. Moreover, AdPPE3x-E1 reduced endothelial cell viability by 90% whereas nonendothelial cells were not affected. In in vitro and in vivo Matrigel models, endothelial cells infected with AdPPE3x-E1 did not develop capillary-like structures. The systemic administration ofAdPPE3x-E1 reduced the lung metastases burden in a cotton rat model by 55%, compared with saline-treated rats, without significant evidence of toxicity. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that the viral copy number ofAdPPE3x-E1 was increased 3-fold in the lung metastases but not in the liver, compared with a nonreplicating adenovector control. Conclusions: We have shown here for the first time an antimetastatic effect induced by an angiogenesis-transcriptionally targeted adenovirus following systemic administration. Because adenovirus replication is more efficient in humans than in cotton rats, we assume a significant effect forAdPPE3x-E1 treatment in fighting human solid tumors and metastases. © 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-63449098636&amp;doi=10.1158%2f1078-0432.CCR-08-1670&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4bc5d9af8b1f813d39b9bdc2670af63d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>González-Vioque, E.</author><author>Torres-Torronteras, J.</author><author>Andreu, A.L.</author><author>Martí, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Limited dCTP availability accounts for mitochondrial DNA depletion in mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE)</title><secondary-title>PLoS Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS Genetics</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1002035</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a severe human disease caused by mutations in TYMP, the gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP). It belongs to a broader group of disorders characterized by a pronounced reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in one or more tissues. In most cases, these disorders are caused by mutations in genes involved in deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) metabolism. It is generally accepted that imbalances in mitochondrial dNTP pools resulting from these mutations interfere with mtDNA replication. Nonetheless, the precise mechanistic details of this effect, in particular, how an excess of a given dNTP (e.g., imbalanced dTTP excess observed in TP deficiency) might lead to mtDNA depletion, remain largely unclear. Using an in organello replication experimental model with isolated murine liver mitochondria, we observed that overloads of dATP, dGTP, or dCTP did not reduce the mtDNA replication rate. In contrast, an excess of dTTP decreased mtDNA synthesis, but this effect was due to secondary dCTP depletion rather than to the dTTP excess in itself. This was confirmed in human cultured cells, demonstrating that our conclusions do not depend on the experimental model. Our results demonstrate that the mtDNA replication rate is unaffected by an excess of any of the 4 separate dNTPs and is limited by the availability of the dNTP present at the lowest concentration. Therefore, the availability of dNTP is the key factor that leads to mtDNA depletion rather than dNTP imbalances. These results provide the first test of the mechanism that accounts for mtDNA depletion in MNGIE and provide evidence that limited dNTP availability is the common cause of mtDNA depletion due to impaired anabolic or catabolic dNTP pathways. Thus, therapy approaches focusing on restoring the deficient substrates should be explored. © 2011 González-Vioque et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79953735865&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1002035&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b5e4e2e9a4fd7b0bb87ae0f6de643abb</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Serafin, J.</author><author>Kozbelt, A.</author><author>Seidel, A.</author><author>Dolese, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic evaluation of high- and low-creativity drawings by artist and nonartist raters: Replication and methodological extension</title><secondary-title>Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts</full-title></periodical><pages>350-359</pages><volume>5</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1037/a0023587</electronic-resource-num><abstract>How do creators evaluate works-in-progress to guide them to successful completion To study this process, artist and nonartist raters assessed in-progress states of high- and low-quality emerging artworks. States were presented sequentially, as a methodological variant to previous research using random order presentation. Results for nonartists replicated earlier findings of a reliably shallower slope for the quality trajectories of high-quality drawings, as defined by artists. Results for artists were more complex; ratings of artists with different aesthetic judgment criteria were examined separately. Artists not valuing abstraction showed mostly similar results as nonartist raters. Inconsistent with earlier findings, abstraction-valuing showed no difference in high- versus low-quality drawings' trajectory slopes. Analyses of time-quality correlations for individual raters suggest abstraction-valuing artists gave lower ratings to later stages of low-quality drawings, producing null effects for slope. This implies that although sequential presentation may be more ecologically valid, random presentation yields results which allow better inferences as to the differences in the creative process. © 2011 American Psychological Association.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875492797&amp;doi=10.1037%2fa0023587&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b00003aba920f2c666bac09b847f29c1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Salgueira, A.P.</author><author>Frada, T.</author><author>Aguiar, P.</author><author>Costa, M.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Jefferson scale of physician lifelong learning: Translation and adaptation for the Portuguese medical population</title><secondary-title>Acta Medica Portuguesa</secondary-title><short-title>Aprendizagem ao longo da vida do médico: Tradução e adaptação da escala de Jefferson</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Medica Portuguesa</full-title></periodical><pages>247-256</pages><volume>22</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The competence and professionalism of doctors depend on the process of Lifelong Learning (LLL). In the Portuguese settings, in which the re-certification of physicians' skills or knowledge is currently not required, the exercise of LLL is left to personal motivation and initiative. The importance of LLL has been highlighted in numerous international recommendations and has already led, in the United States, to the development and validation of a scale for measuring physician LLL - the Jefferson Scale of Physician Life Long Learning (JSPLL). The lack of valid instruments to measure LLL adapted to the Portuguese contexts was the basis for this work, which presents the translation and adaptation of JSPLL, and the subsequent validation of the translated version to the Portuguese medical community. The translation and validation of the English version of JSPLL (JSPLL-VP) was conducted with physicians of Health Care institutions in the District of Braga, Portugal, in 2007. Methods of both qualitative (translation, assessment of the translation, retro translation) and quantitative nature (internal consistency analysis, factor analysis and analysis of response frequencies) resulted in a factor analysis that replicated, with the exception of three items, the distribution of the original scale by four factors: professional learning beliefs and motivation, scholarly activities, attention to learning opportunities and technical skills in seeking information. The results show that the JSPLL-VP is a valid Scale fit for purpose. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the whole scale (.89) and for each factor, confirmed the internal consistency of the Scale. Additionally, differences were found between mean and standard deviations for different Scale factors. In summary, this work provides a new validated tool to monitor physician's LLL in Portugal. The transversal characterization of LLL of specific medical professionals - by specialty or by type of institution - or longitudinal studies in relation with profiles of medical training can contribute to the quality of Medical Education at the pre- or post-graduate levels. © 2009 CELOM.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70449717525&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5cfbb4872850a22764320598847bff3f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arnoult, N.</author><author>Shin-Ya, K.</author><author>Londoño-Vallejo, J.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Studying telomere replication by Q-CO-FISH: The effect of telomestatin, a potent G-quadruplex ligand</title><secondary-title>Cytogenetic and Genome Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cytogenetic and Genome Research</full-title></periodical><pages>229-236</pages><volume>122</volume><number>3-4</number><issue>3-4</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1159/000167808</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Telomere replication is a critical process for preserving genome integrity. The telomere replication fork proceeds unidirectionally from the last subtelomeric origin towards the end of the chromosome, replicating the 5′-3′ G-rich strand by lagging mechanisms and the complementary C-rich strand by leading mechanisms. It has been proposed that the G-rich nature of telomeres may favor the formation of secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes during replication and that specific mechanisms must prevent this to allow the fork to progress unimpeded. The potential of G-quadruplex formation by telomeric sequences has been clearly demonstrated in vitro but it is not known whether these structures form in vivo. We tested the effect of a potent and specific G-quadruplex ligand, telomestatin (TMS), on telomere replication using a novel quantitative approach applied to CO-FISH. We show that TMS, although it penetrates and persists within cells, does not affect telomere replication after short or long-term treatments of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. It does however affect the hybridization efficiency of FISH telomeric probes that recognize the G-rich strand. Our work illustrates the use of a novel technique to measure telomere replication efficiency and suggests that G-quadruplex ligands do not affect telomere replication in a non tumoral context.

The characteristics of volt-time breakdown under STLI waves are shown and compared with the characteristics obtained under standard lightning impulse (LI:1.2/50μ s). Models based on the disruptive effect, as proposed by Kind and Chowdhuri, are considered and applied in order to reproduce the volt-time characteristics under standard and nonstandard lightning voltages. The application viability of these models to tested insulators is considered and discussed and the accuracy in their reproduction is evaluated. It is demonstrated that the Kind model, calibrated with a suitable selection of the parameters using standard flashover data (LI), is able to estimate the response of the insulators to the short tail lightning impulses (STLI) with satisfactory accuracy. © 2009 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-73849088312&amp;doi=10.1109%2fTPWRD.2009.2033956&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=038641c515628ebc7f4245ba7fa78cea</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nishida, N.</author><author>Mawatari, Y.</author><author>Sageshima, M.</author><author>Tokunaga, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Highly parallel and short-acting amplification with locus-specific primers to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms by the DigiTag2 assay</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0029967</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The DigiTag2 assay enables analysis of a set of 96 SNPs using Kapa 2GFast HotStart DNA polymerase with a new protocol that has a total running time of about 7 hours, which is 6 hours shorter than the previous protocol. Quality parameters (conversion rate, call rate, reproducibility and concordance) were at the same levels as when genotype calls were acquired using the previous protocol. Multiplex PCR with 192 pairs of locus-specific primers was available for target preparation in the DigiTag2 assay without the optimization of reaction conditions, and quality parameters had the same levels as those acquired with 96-plex PCR. The locus-specific primers were able to achieve sufficient (concentration of target amplicon ≥5 nM) and specific (concentration of unexpected amplicons &lt;2 nM) amplification within 2 hours, were also able to achieve detectable amplifications even when working in a 96-plex or 192-plex form. The improved DigiTag2 assay will be an efficient platform for screening an intermediate number of SNPs (tens to hundreds of sites) in the replication analysis after genome-wide association study. Moreover, highly parallel and short-acting amplification with locus-specific primers may thus facilitate widespread application to other PCR-based assays. © 2012 Nishida et al.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855833495&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0029967&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b12db55bba31c9f8afb82c50604df373</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buness, A.</author><author>Ruschhaupt, M.</author><author>Kuner, R.</author><author>Tresch, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Classification across gene expression microarray studies</title><secondary-title>BMC Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-10-453</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The increasing number of gene expression microarray studies represents an important resource in biomedical research. As a result, gene expression based diagnosis has entered clinical practice for patient stratification in breast cancer. However, the integration and combined analysis of microarray studies remains still a challenge. We assessed the potential benefit of data integration on the classification accuracy and systematically evaluated the generalization performance of selected methods on four breast cancer studies comprising almost 1000 independent samples. To this end, we introduced an evaluation framework which aims to establish good statistical practice and a graphical way to monitor differences. The classification goal was to correctly predict estrogen receptor status (negative/positive) and histological grade (low/high) of each tumor sample in an independent study which was not used for the training. For the classification we chose support vector machines (SVM), predictive analysis of microarrays (PAM), random forest (RF) and k-top scoring pairs (kTSP). Guided by considerations relevant for classification across studies we developed a generalization of kTSP which we evaluated in addition. Our derived version (DV) aims to improve the robustness of the intrinsic invariance of kTSP with respect to technologies and preprocessing.Results: For each individual study the generalization error was benchmarked via complete cross-validation and was found to be similar for all classification methods. The misclassification rates were substantially higher in classification across studies, when each single study was used as an independent test set while all remaining studies were combined for the training of the classifier. However, with increasing number of independent microarray studies used in the training, the overall classification performance improved. DV performed better than the average and showed slightly less variance. In particular, the better predictive results of DV in across platform classification indicate higher robustness of the classifier when trained on single channel data and applied to gene expression ratios.Conclusions: We present a systematic evaluation of strategies for the integration of independent microarray studies in a classification task. Our findings in across studies classification may guide further research aiming on the construction of more robust and reliable methods for stratification and diagnosis in clinical practice. © 2009 Buness et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-75449097597&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1471-2105-10-453&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=03420d3d30cb4af445006ad2e96542c1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Rugy, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization of visuomotor adaptation to different muscles is less efficient: Experiment and model</title><secondary-title>Human Movement Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human Movement Science</full-title></periodical><pages>684-700</pages><volume>29</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.humov.2010.01.008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reaching to visual targets engages the nervous system in a series of transformations between sensory information and motor commands to muscles. We recently showed that visuomotor adaptation requiring modulation of the activity of the same muscles is more efficient than adaptation requiring a transition to different muscles. Here I specifically tested for adaptation at the level of the final transformation into muscle activation by assessing generalization to unpracticed areas of the workspace, and propose a computational model with modulation of muscle synergies. In the experiment, a visuomotor rotation was applied during a center-out isometric torque production task carefully configured such that adaptation and generalization could be achieved either by only rescaling the contribution of the same muscles, or by additionally requiring the recruitment of different muscles. Consistent with our previous finding, the time course of directional errors revealed that the degree of adaptation was substantially lower (by 28.1%) for the latter case. More importantly, directional error obtained for generalization that required, in principle, to recruit different muscles from these implicated in the adaptation was more than twice that of other generalization areas. Taken together, these results suggest that modulation within an original muscle synergy contributed to visuomotor adaptation, and that synergy recomposition imposed a limitation on both adaptation and generalization. I reproduced these results with a model of the sensorimotor transformation which includes two population codes, one for the sensory network and one for the motor network. Muscle synergies are defined as linear combination of muscles by connections of the motor network, and modulation of these synergies are elicited by adaptation of the weight of these connections. Finally, I speculate that the limitation imposed on synergy recomposition originates in the balance of inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms that operate at different levels of the nervous system, and that contribute to the functional organization of muscle recruitment by focusing activity on relevant muscles. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956448688&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.humov.2010.01.008&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=809932c2f7369f936acae0217bbe2d55</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patel, P.C.</author><author>Fiet, J.O.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancing the internal validity of entrepreneurship experiments by assessing treatment effects at multiple levels across multiple trials</title><secondary-title>Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization</full-title></periodical><pages>127-140</pages><volume>76</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jebo.2010.02.017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Treatment effects in entrepreneurship experiments could vary significantly due to environmental uncertainty and individual heterogeneity. Drawing on critical realism, experimental replication is useful for assessing the generalizability of the treatment effects or for confirming treatment effects across diverse entrepreneurship settings. Yet, experiments in entrepreneurship have traditionally relied on single experimental trials and have not considered potential variance in treatment effects across contexts. Accounting for variance in treatment effects is even more pertinent under higher levels of environmental uncertainty. To help assess the contingent effects of treatments across contexts, we propose a set of methodological and statistical approaches for entrepreneurship researchers. Using different types of experimental replications and proposed statistical methods, one may draw inferences about treatment effects at the trial-, the treatment-, and at the individual-level. We illustrate the proposed approach using experimental replications across three randomized, post-test, experiments. © 2010.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956265629&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jebo.2010.02.017&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=87d7d2b7bcae50628126c868eb5e7413</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eisenstein, E.L.</author><author>Kawamoto, K.</author><author>Anstrom, K.J.</author><author>Willis, J.M.</author><author>Silvey, G.M.</author><author>Johnson, F.S.</author><author>Edwards, R.</author><author>Mise, J.</author><author>Yaggy, S.D.</author><author>Lobach, D.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical and economic results from a randomized trial of clinical decision support in a rural health network</title><secondary-title>Studies in Health Technology and Informatics</secondary-title></titles><pages>77-81</pages><volume>164</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3233/978-1-60750-709-3-77</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Replication studies evaluate technologies in usual use settings.

However, the role of Ras-Erk signalling in the virus life cycle remains undetermined. To investigate this, levels of RNA replication were measured in genotypes 1 and 2 transient luciferase subgenomic replicon systems in the context of either pharmacological or genetic (dominant-negative) inhibition of MEK1, a kinase in the Ras-Erk signalling cascade. Incubation in the presence of two inhibitors (U0126 and PD184352) resulted in a decrease in the levels of RNA replication, conversely incubation with inhibitor PD98059 resulted in a modest increase in replication. The results obtained with PD98059 could not be explained by an off-target effect on Cox-2, stability of replicon RNA or stimulation of global translation levels, suggesting stimulation by a yet uncharacterized mechanism. To verify data obtained using pharmacological inhibitors the transient replicon RNA was co-electroporated with a dominant-negative mutant of MEK1. This resulted in a reduction in replication, confirming data seen with U0126 and PD184352. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that a low level Ras-Erk signalling activity is required for RNA replication. However, complete inhibition of Ras-Erk signalling is inhibitory. These results suggest that perturbation of this signalling pathway by NS5A may be a mechanism to regulate levels of genomic RNA replication. © 2010 SGM.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-76849092904&amp;doi=10.1099%2fvir.0.016899-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0bd7f297b8892317e3c7140def7c1395</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, E.N.</author><author>Koller, D.L.</author><author>Panganiban, C.</author><author>Szelinger, S.</author><author>Zhang, P.</author><author>Badner, J.A.</author><author>Barrett, T.B.</author><author>Berrettini, W.H.</author><author>Bloss, C.S.</author><author>Byerley, W.</author><author>Coryell, W.</author><author>Edenberg, H.J.</author><author>Foroud, T.</author><author>Gershon, E.S.</author><author>Greenwood, T.A.</author><author>Guo, Y.</author><author>Hipolito, M.</author><author>Keating, B.J.</author><author>Lawson, W.B.</author><author>Liu, C.</author><author>Mahon, P.B.</author><author>McInnis, M.G.</author><author>McMahon, F.J.</author><author>McKinney, R.</author><author>Murray, S.S.</author><author>Nievergelt, C.M.</author><author>Nurnberger Jr., J.I.</author><author>Nwulia, E.A.</author><author>Potash, J.B.</author><author>Rice, J.</author><author>Schulze, T.G.</author><author>Scheftner, W.A.</author><author>Shilling, P.D.</author><author>Zandi, P.P.</author><author>Zöllner, S.</author><author>Craig, D.W.</author><author>Schork, N.J.</author><author>Kelsoe, J.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-Wide association of bipolar disorder suggests an enrichment of replicable associations in regions near genes</title><secondary-title>PLoS Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS Genetics</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1002134</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although a highly heritable and disabling disease, bipolar disorder's (BD) genetic variants have been challenging to identify. We present new genotype data for 1,190 cases and 401 controls and perform a genome-wide association study including additional samples for a total of 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls. We do not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci; however, across all SNPs, we show an association between the power to detect effects calculated from a previous genome-wide association study and evidence for replication (P = 1.5×10-7). To demonstrate that this result is not likely to be a false positive, we analyze replication rates in a large meta-analysis of height and show that, in a large enough study, associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Within BD, SNPs near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. These results indicate that there is likely common genetic variation associated with BD near exons (±10 kb) that could be identified in larger studies and, further, provide a framework for assessing the potential for replication when combining results from multiple studies.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959813723&amp;doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1002134&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c7acfba3d6dfdd3da60ad39800fd2c9f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fisher, C.A.</author><author>Wilshire, C.E.</author><author>Ponsford, J.P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Word discrimination therapy: A new technique for the treatment of a phonologically based word-finding impairment</title><secondary-title>Aphasiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aphasiology</full-title></periodical><pages>676-693</pages><volume>23</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02687030801987382</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The majority of cognitive neuropsychological treatments for impairments in phonological encoding utilise some form of phonological cueing or support. Most commonly, the participant is provided with supporting information about the phonological form of a particular word (either partial or complete, auditory or written), and must then generate the word orally. The provision of target phonology facilitates initial production of the word, which can then be repeatedly trained in order to induce relearning of the appropriate lexical-phonological associations. Aims: The aim of the current case study was to examine the effectiveness of an indirect cueing technique for the treatment of mild impairments in phonological encoding. In this treatment the participant must name pictures without assistance, but the picture names themselves share a phonological relationship (e.g., magnet, mattress, macaroni). These phonologically similar triplets incorporate a form of phonological cueing; however, the cues do not involve the direct provision of the word form. Methods &amp; Procedures: The case reported here, patient TV, suffers from a mild phonological encoding impairment: he produces phonemic paraphasias and other form-related errors on longer and/or less frequent words in spontaneous speech and other spoken word production tasks. In the treatment, TV was asked to name triplets of pictures whose names were either phonologically related (sharing either initial or final phonemes) or unrelated. This procedure was repeated across 12 therapy sessions, all of which trained the same set of words. TV's pre-treatment naming accuracy on the training words was assessed using a repeated baseline design, and was continuously reassessed throughout treatment, and also at 3 months post-therapy. The key comparison was between words trained within phonologically related triplets and control words trained in unrelated triplets. The design also included multiple assessments on an untrained set of words to assess generalisation. Outcomes &amp; Results: For this mild case, naming accuracy for all words trained improved significantly. However, gains were significantly faster for the words that were trained within phonologically related triplets than those trained in unrelated triplets. Significant generalisation to untreated items was also observed, and gains on both treatment items and generalisation effects were maintained at 3 months post therapy. Conclusion: Results from this case study suggest that this type of indirect cueing technique may be a particularly efficient method for treating mild impairments in phonological coding.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-68049109279&amp;doi=10.1080%2f02687030801987382&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c94bf218fc28911477ee7c38724f2a41</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moncarz, E.</author><author>Zhao, J.</author><author>Kay, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An exploratory study of US lodging properties' organizational practices on employee turnover and retention</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management</full-title></periodical><pages>437-458</pages><volume>21</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1108/09596110910955695</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate US lodging properties' organizational employee-retention initiatives and practices, and to examine the impact of those initiatives on employee turnover and retention. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Directory of Hotel &amp; Lodging Companies, a convenient sample group of 24 management companies are selected. A self-administered mail survey instrument is developed to measure and test organizational initiatives and practices on employee turnover and retention. Using SPSS 16.0, two statistical tests are employed to test study hypotheses. Correlation analysis is used to identify the relationships between predictor and response variables. Likewise, regression analysis is used to examine the relationships between predictor and response variables hypothesizing that the effectiveness of practicing the human resource management organizational initiatives on management and non-management retention and turnover will differ. Findings: The findings reveal that Corporate Culture, Hiring and Promotions and Training practices influence non-management employee retention. At the same time, Hiring and Promotion practices impact management retention, as well. Moreover, Organizational Mission, Goals and Direction, and Employee Recognition, Rewards and Compensation were found to positively reduce non-management employee turnover. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the study methodology and the relatively low response rate, generalization of the study findings is limited. Future replication studies are recommended. Practical implications: The findings will equip lodging organizations and industry professionals with the contemporary tools to proactively reduce employee turnover and for maintaining employee retention. This should have a positive impact on workforce productivity. Originality/value: This study makes a major contribution to the relative influence of the practice of eight study-defined organizational initiatives on turnover in lodging businesses. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-69549124114&amp;doi=10.1108%2f09596110910955695&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=23b4427a0188c20d58e31e777fcd5d18</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, H.</author><author>He, W.</author><author>Wang, W.</author><author>Gao, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibitory effect of aqueous dandelion extract on HIV-1 replication and reverse transcriptase activity</title><secondary-title>BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1472-6882-11-112</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is an immunosuppressive disease that results in life-threatening opportunistic infections.

The inhibitory effect of the dandelion extract on reverse transcriptase activity was assessed by the reverse transcriptase assay kit.Results: Compared to control values obtained from cells infected without treatment, the level of HIV-1 replication and reverse transcriptase activity were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The data suggest that dandelion extract has a potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 replication and reverse transcriptase activity. The identification of HIV-1 antiviral compounds from Taraxacum officinale should be pursued.Conclusions: The dandelion extract showed strong activity against HIV-1 RT and inhibited both the HIV-1 vector and the hybrid-MoMuLV/MoMuSV retrovirus replication. These findings provide additional support for the potential therapeutic efficacy of Taraxacum officinale. Extracts from this plant may be regarded as another starting point for the development of an antiretroviral therapy with fewer side effects. © 2011 Han et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-81055134738&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1472-6882-11-112&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=55ca1fe03344c235d1cd5d734338f619</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Z.</author><author>Liu, F.-J.</author><author>Liu, L.</author><author>Zhou, T.-Y.</author><author>Lei, J.</author><author>Xu, L.</author><author>Liu, C.</author><author>Dai, J.</author><author>Chen, E.-Q.</author><author>Tang, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of hepatitis B virus replication mouse model</title><secondary-title>World Journal of Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>World Journal of Gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>1979-1985</pages><volume>16</volume><number>16</number><issue>16</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3748/wjg.v16.i16.1979</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aim: To evaluate the value of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication mouse model with regard to several aspects of the study of HBV biology. Methods: To evaluate the HBV replication mouse model in detecting the efficacy of anti-HBV agents, the interferon inducer polyinosinic-polytidylin acid (polyIC) and nucleotide analogues adefovir and entecavir were administered to mice injected with wild type pHBV4.1, and the inhibiting effect of these agents on HBV DNA replication was evaluated. To identify the model's value in a replication ability study of HBV drug-resistant mutants and a HBx-minus mutant, telbivudine resistance mutants (rtM204I, ayw subtype), adefovir resistance mutants (rtA181V + rtN236T, ayw subtype) and HBxminus mutants were injected respectively, and their corresponding HBV DNA replication intermediates in mouse liver were assessed. Results: Compared with the wild type HBV replication mouse model without antiviral agent treatment, the HBV DNA replication intermediates of the polyICtreated group were decreased 1-fold; while in the entecavir-and adefovir-treated groups, the levels of HBV DNA replication intermediates were inhibited 13.6-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively. For the mouse models injected with telbivudine resistance mutant, adefovir resistance mutant and HBx-minus mutant, HBV DNA replication intermediates could still be detected, but the levels of HBV DNA replication intermediates of these mutants decreased 4.5-fold, 5.6-fold and 2.9-fold respectively, compared with the mouse model with wild type HBV plasmid. Conclusion: The HBV replication mouse model we established was a useful and convenient tool to detect the efficacy of antiviral agents and to study the replication ability of HBV mutants in vivo. © 2010 Baishideng.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77951946551&amp;doi=10.3748%2fwjg.v16.i16.1979&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=256dd5f606f1a593a9b5bedbfd842315</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tanner, N.A.</author><author>Loparo, J.J.</author><author>van Oijen, A.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Visualizing single-molecule DNA replication with fluorescence microscopy</title><secondary-title>Journal of Visualized Experiments</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Visualized Experiments</full-title></periodical><number>32</number><issue>32</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3791/1529</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We describe a simple fluorescence microscopy-based real-time method for observing DNA replication at the single-molecule level.

Although the mortality burden of the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic has been carefully quantified in the United States, Japan, and European countries, little is known about the pandemic experience elsewhere. Here, we compiled extensive archival records to quantify the pandemic mortality patterns in 2 Mexican cities, Mexico City and Toluca. Methods. We applied seasonal excess mortality models to age-specific respiratory mortality rates for 1915- 1920 and quantified the reproduction number from daily data. Results. We identified 3 pandemic waves in Mexico City in spring 1918, autumn 1918, and winter 1920, which were characterized by unusual excess mortality among people 25-44 years old. Toluca experienced 2-fold higher excess mortality rates than Mexico City but did not experience a substantial third wave. All age groups, including that of people ≥65 years old, experienced excess mortality during 1918-1920. Reproduction number estimates were &lt;2.5, assuming a 3-d generation interval. Conclusion. Mexico experienced a herald pandemic wave with elevated young adult mortality in spring 1918, similar to the United States and Europe. In contrast to the United States and Europe, there was no mortality sparing among Mexican seniors ≥65 years old, highlighting potential geographical differences in preexisting immunity to the 1918 virus. We discuss the relevance of our findings to the 2009 pandemic mortality patterns. © 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954722632&amp;doi=10.1086%2f654897&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ab4fc5cdc46ddd43207dcd502c392cd7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gómez, I.</author><author>Franco, L.</author><author>Jerez, J.M.</author><author>Subirats, J.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extension of the generalization complexity measure to real valued input data sets</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</secondary-title></titles><pages>86-94</pages><volume>6063 LNCS</volume><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-642-13278-0_12</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper studies the extension of the Generalization Complexity (GC) measure to real valued input problems. The GC measure, defined in Boolean space, was proposed as a simple tool to estimate the generalization ability that can be obtained when a data set is learnt by a neural network. Using two different discretization methods, the real valued inputs are transformed into binary values, from which the generalization complexity can be straightforwardly computed. The discretization transformation is carried out both through a very simple method based on equal width intervals (EW) and with a more sophisticated supervised method (the CAIM algorithm) that use much more information about the data. A study of the relationship between data complexity and generalization ability obtained was done together with an analysis of the relationship between best neural architecture size and complexity. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954445176&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-13278-0_12&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ffd44656e76abb86d29e121ce28548d1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Du, W.-S.</author><author>Zheng, S.-X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nonlinear conditions for coincidence point and fixed point theorems</title><secondary-title>Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics</full-title></periodical><pages>857-868</pages><volume>16</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.11650/twjm/1500406661</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper, we first establish some new types of fixed point theorem which generalize and improve Berinde-Berinde's fixed point theorem, Mizoguchi- Takahashi's fixed point theorem and many results in [W.-S.

Thus, the objective of treating HBV-induced ALF is to eliminate or significantly suppress HBV replication. Methods/Results: This prospective study (02/2008-02/2009) included 6 patients (1 female and 5 males, median age 35.5 years). HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels were detected, and hepatocyte death was quantified in patients' sera by (a) M65 ELISA and (b) M30 ELISA. All patients received entecavir treatment at 1 mg daily within 1-18 days after admission. Upon treatment, pathologic parameters rapidly decreased and returned to normal values or trace amounts (HBV DNA) within 3 months in all of the cases. A seroconversion to anti-HBsAg was achieved in 5 out of 6 patients; one patient with late onset of treatment did not seroconvert. M65 and the difference of M65-M30 as a marker for cell necrosis dropped significantly within 1 week of treatment. Conclusion: This preliminary series of 6 patients reveals that immediate treatment of HBV-induced ALF with entecavir is well tolerated and beneficially affects the course of the disease. © 2009 S.

It begins with a comparison of the census data and describes the remarkable changes observed. Given the incomplete nature of published data on international migrations and their differentiation by ethnic groups in the inter-census period, the paper applies a method to fill in the gaps and calculate net migration balances for each ethnic group. Also, since no data is available on the net reproductive rates for separate ethnic groups in Ukraine, it sets out a method to estimate net reproduction rates for Ukrainians and Russians in the inter-census period. Using these methods, it establishes that differences in net migration on the one hand and the differences in net reproduction on the other contributed 11.1 and 4.4 percent of the growth in the share of Ukrainians and 6.8 and 5.2 percent in the sizeable decline in the share of Russians. The remaining lion’s share is a shift in identity among members of ethnically mixed (mainly Russian-Ukrainian) families. Mothers of ethnically mixed families, identifying the ethnicity of their newly born, contributed 11.4 percent to the Ukrainian gain and 9.2 percent to the Russian loss. The remaining 73.1 percent of the Ukrainian gain and 78.8 percent of Russian loss resulted from lifetime identity shift from Russian to Ukrainian, the most likely candidates being members of Russian-Ukrainian families. © 2009, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

Cell labeling with divisionsensitive markers and competitive transplantation studies have been used to estimate the replication rate of murine HSCs in vivo. However, these methods are not feasible in humans and surrogate assays are required. In this report, we analyze the changing ratio with age of maternal/ paternal X-chromosome phenotypes in blood cells from females and infer that human HSCs replicate on average once every 40 weeks (range, 25-50 weeks). We then confirm this estimate with 2 independent approaches, use the estimate to simulate human hematopoiesis, and show that the simulations accurately reproduce marrow transplantation data. Our simulations also provide evidence that the number of human HSCs increases from birth until adolescence and then plateaus, and that the ratio of contributing to quiescent HSCs in humans significantly differs from mouse. In addition, they suggest that human marrow failure, such as the marrow failure that occurs after umbilical cord blood transplantation and with aplastic anemia, results from insufficient numbers of early progenitor cells, and not the absence of HSCs. © 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955974343&amp;doi=10.1182%2fblood-2010-08-303537&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bd72433b69f3836c459f791b6beb9beb</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Christ, T.J.</author><author>Riley-Tillman, T.C.</author><author>Chafouleas, S.M.</author><author>Boice, C.H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Direct behavior rating (DBR): Generalizability and dependability across raters and observations</title><secondary-title>Educational and Psychological Measurement</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Educational and Psychological Measurement</full-title></periodical><pages>825-843</pages><volume>70</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0013164410366695</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Generalizability theory was used to examine the generalizability and dependability of outcomes from two single-item Direct Behavior Rating (DBR) scales: DBR of actively manipulating and DBR of visually distracted. DBR is a behavioral assessment tool with specific instrumentation and procedures that can be used by a variety of service delivery providers (e.g., teacher, teacher aide, parent, etc.) to collect time-series data on student behavior. The purpose of this study was to extend the findings presented by Chafouleas et al. with an examination of DBR outcomes as they are generalized across raters and rating occasions. One hundred twenty-five undergraduates viewed and rated student behavior on video clips while the children engaged in an unsolvable Lego puzzle task. A series of decision studies were used to evaluate the effects of alternate assessment conditions (variable numbers of raters and rating occasions) and interpretive assumptions (definitions of the universe of generalization). Results support the general conclusion that ratings from individual or small groups of simultaneous raters, when generalized only to that specific individual or group of individuals, can approach reliability criteria for low- and high-stakes decisions.

With few identified imported cases, the epidemic spread through schools and communities leading to 897 confirmed cases by 3 June 2009. The estimated reproduction ratio up to 31 May 2009 was 2.4 (95% credible interval (CI): 2.1-2.6). Methods designed to account for undetected transmission reduce this estimate to 1.6 (95% CI: 1.5-1.8). Time varying reproduction ratio estimates show a steady decline in observed transmission over the first 14 days of the epidemic. This could be accounted for by ascertainment bias or a true impact of interventions including antiviral prophylaxis, treatment and school closure. Most cases (78%) in the first 19 days in Victoria were under the age of 20 years-old. Estimates suggest that the average youth primary case infected at least two other youths in the early growth phase, which was sufficient to drive the epidemic.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-73349125813&amp;doi=10.2807%2fese.14.42.19363-en&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c99922347b5f5ef6af9b330456ddff1a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McHugh, L.</author><author>Bobarnac, A.</author><author>Reed, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Brief report: Teaching situation-based emotions to children with autistic spectrum disorder</title><secondary-title>Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders</full-title></periodical><pages>1423-1428</pages><volume>41</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10803-010-1152-2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have difficulty recognizing emotions in themselves and others. Three children (all males) participated in the study. In a multi-element design children with ASD were trained to tact situation-based emotions (i.e., "happy", "sad", "angry", and "afraid") using novel video based scenarios. To increase the likelihood that each child would learn a generalized repertoire of emotion understanding, multiple exemplars of emotion identification were trained using a multi-component procedure. The results indicated significant increases in tacting situationbased emotions. To evaluate the generalization of training, novel video stories were employed that depicted the trained emotions. The findings indicated generalization of situation- based emotional tacting to the novel video stories. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-82755161912&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10803-010-1152-2&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b2b18a127b758c038e85bc7e39cbeb0f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barton, S.E.</author><author>Correia, K.F.</author><author>Shalev, S.</author><author>Missmer, S.A.</author><author>Lehmann, L.S.</author><author>Shah, D.K.</author><author>Ginsburg, E.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Population-based study of attitudes toward posthumous reproduction</title><secondary-title>Fertility and Sterility</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fertility and Sterility</full-title></periodical><pages>735-740.e5</pages><volume>98</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.05.044</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: To measure public attitudes toward posthumous reproduction. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Electronic survey. Patient(s): A total of 1,049 men and women living in the United States between the ages of 18 and 75 years. Intervention(s): Multiple-choice questionnaire. Main Outcome Measure(s): Descriptive statistics regarding support for posthumous reproduction, such as regarding emergency harvesting of gametes, and attitudes toward consent; multivariable analyses of demographic and personal experiences associated with support for posthumous reproduction. Result(s): Results showed that 47.8% supported and 31.1% opposed retrieving gametes from men, and 42.7% supported and 35.9% opposed retrieving gametes from women. The remainder was undecided. Among supporters, 69.8% believed prior consent from the deceased was required. Support was positively associated with younger age, higher education, higher income, Democratic political party affiliation, history of infertility, and currently attempting conception. Gender, religion, race, and region of the country were not associated with support. Organ donors and those who support IVF were more likely to support posthumous reproduction (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.68 [1.19-2.38] and 12.30 [6.56-23.04], respectively). Most respondents were initially unfamiliar with posthumous reproduction. Conclusion(s): Almost 50% of the general population support posthumous reproduction in men and women. The majority favored prior consent from the deceased. These data caution against emergency gamete harvesting without prior consent. © 2012 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865698411&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.fertnstert.2012.05.044&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c0a25db980e6f31ddd18e651fdde0cb4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Che-Castaldo, J.P.</author><author>Inouye, D.W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of dataset length and mast seeding on the demography of Frasera speciosa, a long-lived monocarpic plant</title><secondary-title>Ecosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosphere</full-title></periodical><volume>2</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/ES11-00263.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Frasera speciosa (Gentianaceae) is a long-lived monocarpic plant with mast seeding, a type of plant whose demography is rarely studied. Using a 35-year dataset from an ongoing study, we described the population dynamics of F. speciosa using matrix projection models, addressed how many years of data are needed to estimate population growth and elasticity values consistently, and examined the effects of mast seeding on demographic parameter estimates. Our results indicated that our population is likely stable, with the annual population growth rate near one (λ = 0.969, λs = 0.967 with 95% CI = 0.923-1.013). Mean generation time was 40 years and the mean estimated lifespan was 6.86 years with a high variance of 181.8 years for individuals starting in the seedling stage, consistent with observations of very long-lived individuals in the field. Elasticity values were highest for the transitions representing stasis and lowest for reproduction. For dataset length, 15 years of data yielded lambda estimates that were within 1% of the long-term estimate, but 20 years of data were needed to yield lambdas with confidence intervals that consistently overlap one. Although mast seeding is generally defined using the inter-annual variation in seed production per unit area, stochastic lambdas were not correlated with this measure of reproduction but instead correlated with per capita dormant seed production and per capita recruit production. Mean survival rate was also positively correlated with stochastic lambda estimates, despite the necessary increase in mortality in years with high reproduction. Our results indicated that the demography of F. speciosa is similar to that of other long-lived monocarps without mast seeding, that long datasets may be needed to capture the variation in demographic rates even for stable populations, and that life history stages with low elasticity values can still be very important to population growth.

This paper presents the methodology for conducting controlled experiment replication, as well as, results of a controlled experiment and an internal replication that investigated the effectiveness of intelligent authoring shell eXtended Tutor-Expert System (xTEx-Sys). The initial and the replicated experiment were based on our approach that combines classical two-group experimental design and with factoral design. A trait that distinguishes this approach from others is the existence of arbitrary number of checkpoint-tests to determine the effectiveness in intermediate states. We call it a pre-and-post test control group experimental design with checkpoint-tests. The gained results revealed small or even negative effect sizes, which could be explained by the fact that the xTEx-Sys's domain knowledge presentation is rather novel for students and therefore difficult to grasp and apply in earlier phases of the experiment. In order to develop and improve the xTEx-Sys, further experiments must be conducted. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Extensive research has been conducted and over hundred genes have been associated with asthma and atopy phenotypes, but many of these findings have failed to replicate in subsequent studies. To separate true associations from false positives, candidate genes need to be examined in large well-characterized samples, using standardized designs (genotyping, phenotyping and analysis). In an attempt to replicate previous associations we amalgamated the power and resources of four studies and genotyped 5,565 individuals to conduct a genetic association study of 93 previously associated candidate genes for asthma and related phenotypes using the same set of 861 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a common genotyping platform, and relatively harmonized phenotypes. We tested for association between SNPs and the dichotomous outcomes of asthma, atopy, atopic asthma, and airway hyperresponsiveness using a general allelic likelihood ratio test. No SNP in any gene reached significance levels that survived correction for all tested SNPs, phenotypes, and genes. Even after relaxing the usual stringent multiple testing corrections by performing a gene-based analysis (one gene at a time as if no other genes were typed) and by stratifying SNPs based on their prior evidence of association, no genes gave strong evidence of replication. There was weak evidence to implicate the following: IL13, IFNGR2, EDN1, and VDR in asthma; IL18, TBXA2R, IFNGR2, and VDR in atopy; TLR9, TBXA2R, VDR, NOD2, and STAT6 in airway hyperresponsiveness; TLR10, IFNGR2, STAT6, VDR, and NPSR1 in atopic asthma. Additionally we found an excess of SNPs with small effect sizes (OR &lt; 1.4). The low rate of replication may be due to small effect size, differences in phenotypic definition, differential environmental effects, and/or genetic heterogeneity. To aid in future replication studies of asthma genes a comprehensive database was compiled and is available to the scientific community at http://genapha.icapture.ubc.ca/. © Springer-Verlag 2009.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67349208909&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00439-009-0643-8&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ad53cb56dcf62308983fa6677a6af0dd</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manapat, M.</author><author>Ohtsuki, H.</author><author>Bürger, R.</author><author>Nowak, M.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Originator dynamics</title><secondary-title>Journal of Theoretical Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Theoretical Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>586-595</pages><volume>256</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.10.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We study the origin of evolution. Evolution is based on replication, mutation, and selection. But how does evolution begin? When do chemical kinetics turn into evolutionary dynamics? We propose "prelife" and "prevolution" as the logical precursors of life and evolution. Prelife generates sequences of variable length. Prelife is a generative chemistry that proliferates information and produces diversity without replication. The resulting "prevolutionary dynamics" have mutation and selection. We propose an equation that allows us to investigate the origin of evolution. In one limit, this "originator equation" gives the classical selection equation. In the other limit, we obtain "prelife." There is competition between life and prelife and there can be selection for or against replication. Simple prelife equations with uniform rate constants have the property that longer sequences are exponentially less frequent than shorter ones. But replication can reverse such an ordering. As the replication rate increases, some longer sequences can become more frequent than shorter ones. Thus, replication can lead to "reversals" in the equilibrium portraits. We study these reversals, which mark the transition from prelife to life in our model. If the replication potential exceeds a critical value, then life replicates into existence. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This qualitative replication study evaluated the differential effect of pop-up messages compared to static signs and the content of messages on EGMs on recall, thoughts, and behaviors assessed during the session and at 2-week follow-up. In Study 1, 127 regular EGM gamblers (male = 97, mean age = 20. 3) recruited from a university student population attended a laboratory where they were randomly assigned to play a computer-based simulated EGM analogue displaying signs that differed by (a) mode of presentation (pop-up and static) and (b) message content (informative, self-appraisal, and control/blank). In Study 2, an identical methodology was used but included the use of a simulated EGM within an in vivo gaming setting with 124 regular EGM players (male = 81, mean age = 44.1). Results from both studies showed that pop-up messages were recalled more effectively than static messages immediately and at 2-week follow-up. Pop-up messages reportedly had a significantly greater impact on within-session thoughts and behaviors. Messages encouraging self-appraisal resulted in significantly greater effect on self-reported thoughts and behaviors during both the experimental session and in subsequent EGM play. These findings support the effectiveness of pop-up messages containing self-appraisal messages as an appropriate harm-minimization initiative. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-76749149934&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10899-009-9150-z&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=78016918b3ea4eee548d0e53726cd393</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hanson, G.R.</author><author>Suggs, J.F.</author><author>Freiberg, A.A.</author><author>Durbhakula, S.</author><author>Li, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigation of in vivo 6DOF total knee arthoplasty kinematics using a dual orthogonal fluoroscopic system</title><secondary-title>Journal of Orthopaedic Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Orthopaedic Research</full-title></periodical><pages>974-981</pages><volume>24</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jor.20141</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fluoroscopic techniques have been recently used to detect in vivo knee joint kinematics. This article presents a technique that uses two fluoroscopes to form a dual orthogonal fluoroscopic system for accurately measuring in vivo 6DOF total knee arthoplasty (TKA) kinematics. The system was rigorously validated and used to investigate in vivo kinematics of 12 patients after cruciate-retaining TKA. In a repeatability study, the pose of two different TKA components was reproduced with standard deviations (SD) of 0.17 mm and 0.57° about all three axes. In an accuracy study, the reproduced component positions were compared to the known component positions. Position and rotation mean errors were all within 0.11 mm and 0.24°, with SD within 0.11 mm and 0.48°, respectively. The results of this study show that the matching process of the imaging system is able to accurately reproduce the spatial positions and orientations of both the femoral and tibial components. For CR TKA patients, a consistent anterior femoral translation was observed with flexion through 45° of flexion, and thereafter, the femur translated posteriorly with further flexion. The medial-lateral translation was measured to be less than 2 mm throughout the entire flexion range. Internal tibial rotation steadily increased through maximum flexion by approximately 6°. Varus rotation was also measured with flexion but had a mean magnitude less than 2.0°. In conclusion, the dual orthogonal fluoroscopic system accurately detects TKA kinematics and is applicable towards other joints of the musculoskeletal system, including the wrist, elbow, shoulder, ankle, and spine. © 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Such deficits presumably contribute much to the social dysfunction characteristic of schizophrenia. This study examined the efficacy of a novel attentional-shaping intervention to improve emotion perception abilities. Sixty participants with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions: 1) attentional-shaping, 2) contingent monetary reinforcement, or 3) repeated practice. Participants completed the Face Emotion Identification Test (FEIT) at pre-test, intervention, post-test, and one week follow-up. Participants also completed the Bell-Lysaker Emotion Recognition Test (BLERT) and the Social Behavior Scale at pre-test and follow-up to measure generalization. The results showed that the attentional-shaping condition had significantly higher scores on the FEIT at intervention, post-test, and follow-up compared to monetary reinforcement and repeated practice. Improvement was also found on the BLERT and a trend was found for improved social behaviors at one-week follow-up. Results will be discussed in terms of face scanning and attentional deficits present in schizophrenia and potential uses of this intervention in the remediation of emotion perception deficits. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Schouten &amp; Veldkamp) was evaluated through a field experiment conducted on Kanatsiohareke, a Mohawk farm, and at the LaFayette Experiment Station near Syracuse, New York. The effects of competition reduction and two cover crops on Sweetgrass reestablishment success were examined. Sweetgrass was planted under four treatments: Sweetgrass alone; with existing, old-field vegetation; with a cover crop of Hairy vetch (Vicia villosa); and with a cover crop of Annual (Italian) ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum). The experiment consisted of five replicates of the four treatments at both LaFayette and Kanatsiohareke. Sweetgrass biomass, height, reproduction rate, and survivorship were greatest in plots that were weeded to eliminate competition and in plots with Hairy vetch as a cover crop. A cover crop of Annual ryegrass resulted in reduced Sweetgrass growth and reproduction. The results of this field experiment indicate that there is great restoration potential for Sweetgrass because it is easily transplanted and reproduces vigorously. For 22.5-m2 plots, Hairy vetch is an effective cover crop for Sweetgrass. Planting the Sweetgrass with Hairy vetch generated properties of the grass that are desired by basket-makers, such as abundance and tall blades. This technique also allowed for a relatively non-labor intensive method of cultivation. Reestablishment of Sweetgrass offers the members and visitors of Kanatsiohareke the means to continue to use the plant, strengthen traditional practices associated with Sweetgrass, and benefit economically by selling baskets and medicine made with Sweetgrass. © 2005 Society for Ecological Restoration International.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21044440589&amp;doi=10.1111%2fj.1526-100X.2005.00033.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e8109aa2fd719eaab27a595385677daf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, L.-W.</author><author>Woolbright, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Color reproduction optimization: A study of current technology &amp; practice for the flexographic printing process</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the Technical Association of the Graphic Arts, TAGA</secondary-title></titles><pages>452-481</pages><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Accurate color reproduction is a critical concern in the printing industry. Over the years, technological improvements continued to make color reproduction predictable and reduced difficulties experienced in the industry. G7™ is a proposed calibration method for commercial offset lithographic printing that was developed to support the GRACoL7™ specification; it also suggests improved color matching across media and printing processes. The goal of G7™ is to match appearance in which gray balance is one of the most vital metrics of visual appearance (Hutcheson) across various media. Therefore, when G7™ calibration is used for any print reproduction proces, the appearance of the color reproductions from different devices should "appear" the same. The printing process used for this study was flexographic corrugated direct printing, using the G7™ calibration methodology on a Bobst 160, sheetfeed corrugated printing press. Fifteen samples were randomly selected for data analysis. The results showed when G7™ calibration methodology was applied to the corrugated printing process using standard inks and optimized material combinations the color reproduction metrics analyzed were close to the standard G7 M condition. Neutral gray was achieved when G7™ calibration methodology was used in the corrugated printing color reproduction process.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-52349091717&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ccbec657c11b88f5a6f9c56c74e9b796</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilensky, U.</author><author>Rand, W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Making models match: Replicating an agent-based model</title><secondary-title>JASSS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JASSS</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Scientists have increasingly employed computer models in their work. Recent years have seen a proliferation of agent-based models in the natural and social sciences. But with the exception of a few "classic" models, most of these models have never been replicated by anyone but the original developer. As replication is a critical component of the scientific method and a core practice of scientists, we argue herein for an increased practice of replication in the agentbased modeling community, and for widespread discussion of the issues surrounding replication. We begin by clarifying the concept of replication as it applies to ABM. Furthermore we argue that replication may have even greater benefits when applied to computational models than when applied to physical experiments. Replication of computational models affects model verification and validation and fosters shared understanding about modeling decisions. To facilitate replication, we must create standards for both how to replicate models and how to evaluate the replication. In this paper, we present a case study of our own attempt to replicate a classic agent-based model. We begin by describing an agent-based model from political science that was developed by Axelrod and Hammond. We then detail our effort to replicate that model and the challenges that arose in recreating the model and in determining if the replication was successful. We conclude this paper by discussing issues for (1) researchers attempting to replicate models and (2) researchers developing models in order to facilitate the replication of their results. © Copyright JASSS.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-36249009212&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6c3302f96b2424871942e0e4a7eec1d7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barbuto Jr, J.E.</author><author>Gifford, G.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sources of work motivation of business leaders in the usa and south africa: a cross-cultural comparison using the motivational sources inventory</title><secondary-title>Psychological Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychological Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>636-640</pages><volume>101</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2466/PR0.101.2.636-640</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Motivational differences in response to the Motivation Sources Inventory were tested between U.S. (n = 138) and South-African (n = 114) work samples.

Obtaining cytological specimens by wire-guided endobiliary brushing at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a convenient way to reach a diagnosis. Sensitivity for malignant disease is generally around 50% and specificity around 100%. The present study was designed to assess the reproducibility of the cytological examination. Material and methods. Samples were obtained from 55 consecutive patients with biliary duct strictures that eventually turned out to be caused by malignant disease in 41 patients (73%). The cytology specimens were evaluated twice in different random order with an interval of at least 4 months by two pathologists blinded to the final diagnoses. Suitability for diagnosis (suitable, suboptimal or unsuitable) and cytologic diagnosis (benign, atypical, suspicious for malignancy and malignant cells) were registered. Kappa analysis was applied. Results. Regarding suitability for diagnosis, the two observers reproduced their findings in 84% (kappa 0.76) and 87% (0.59) (p &gt;0.05), while the interobserver variations on the two occasions were 76% and 78% (kappa 0.49 and 0.58, respectively) (p &gt;0.05). Five percent of samples were rated as inadequate for diagnosis in at least one reading; 18% were suboptimal and 62-82% were suitable. The observers reproduced their cytological diagnosis in 77% and 71% (weighted kappa 0.83 and 0.75) (p &gt;0.05), and agreed on the cytological diagnosis in 65% and 73% (weighted kappa 0.65 and 0.75) (p &gt;0.05). Conclusions. The intra- and interobserver agreement in cytological evaluation of endobiliary brushings from bile duct strictures is generally good. The rates of inadequate and suboptimal samples can probably be reduced by modifications of the brush design. © 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33646492017&amp;doi=10.1080%2f00365520500389099&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=76cbf7ba600008685eb9b8049d3b1d21</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacNeil, A.</author><author>Sarr, A.D.</author><author>Sankalé, J.-L.</author><author>Meloni, S.T.</author><author>Mboup, S.</author><author>Kanki, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Direct evidence of lower viral replication rates in vivo in human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) infection than in HIV-1 infection</title><secondary-title>Journal of Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>5325-5330</pages><volume>81</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JVI.02625-06</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Studies have shown that human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is less pathogenic than HIV-1, with a lower rate of disease progression. Similarly, plasma viral loads are lower in HIV-2 infection, suggesting that HIV-2 replication is restricted in vivo in comparison to that of HIV-1. However, to date, in vivo studies characterizing replication intermediates in the viral life cycle of HIV-2 have been limited. In order to test the hypothesis that HIV-2 has a lower replication rate in vivo than HIV-1 does, we quantified total viral DNA, integrated proviral DNA, cell-associated viral mRNA, and plasma viral loads in peripheral blood samples from groups of therapy-naïve HIV-1-infected (n = 21) and HIV-2-infected (n = 18) individuals from Dakar, Senegal, with CD4+ T-cell counts of &gt;200/μl. Consistent with our previous findings, total viral DNA loads were similar between HIV-1 and HIV-2 and plasma viral loads were higher among HIV-1-infected individuals. Proportions of DNA in the integrated form were also similar between these viruses. In contrast, levels of viral mRNA were lower in HIV-2 infection. Our study indicates that HIV-2 is able to establish a stable, integrated proviral infection in vivo, but that accumulation of viral mRNA is attenuated in HIV-2 infection relative to that in HIV-1 infection. The differences in viral mRNA are consistent with the differences in plasma viral loads between HIV-1 and HIV-2 and suggest that lower plasma viral loads, and possibly the attenuated pathogenesis of HIV-2, can be explained by lower rates of viral replication in vivo.

While the use of pollen-derived amino acids by Heliconius butterflies has been interpreted as important for the evolution of extended lifespans, very little is known about the life-history consequences of frugivory. This issue is addressed by investigating effects of four adult diets (sugar, sugar with amino acids, banana, and moistened banana) on lifespan and reproduction in the fruit-feeding butterfly Charaxes fulvescens Aurivillius (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Female butterflies were collected from Kibale National Park, Uganda, and kept individually in cages near their natural habitat and data were collected on lifespan, oviposition, and hatching of eggs. Lifespan in captivity was longer for the sugar and the amino acid cohort, than for the banana cohorts. The longitudinal pattern of oviposition was erratic, with many days without oviposition and few periods with high numbers of eggs laid. Butterflies typically did not lay eggs during their 1st week in captivity and the length of the period between capture and first reproduction was significantly shorter for butterflies fed moistened banana. The length of the reproduction period (first reproduction-last reproduction in captivity) and the reproduction rate (total number of eggs/length of the reproduction period) did not differ significantly between the diet treatments. Those fed with amino acid and moistened banana had significantly higher egg hatchability than those fed with sugar and banana. We found no evidence for a lifespan cost of reproduction. Our results show that (1) female C. fulvescens can use amino acids in their diet for laying fertile eggs, (2) more wing-wear does correlate with lower survival in captivity (indicating aging in the wild), but not with intensity of reproduction (providing no evidence for reproductive aging), and (3) fruit-feeding butterflies may be dietary restricted in the field. © 2008 The Authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-51749097779&amp;doi=10.1111%2fj.1570-7458.2008.00752.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=88df5056eb59e1db67718867bbb3be06</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Richards, T.L.</author><author>Kozak, L.</author><author>Johnson, L.C.</author><author>Standish, L.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replicable functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence of correlated brain signals between physically and sensory isolated subjects</title><secondary-title>Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>955-963</pages><volume>11</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/acm.2005.11.955</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objectives: Previous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments have suggested that correlated neural signals may be detected in the brains of individuals who are physically and sensorily isolated from each other. Functional MRI and EEG methods were used in the present study in an attempt to replicate these findings. Design/settings: Subjects were electrically and magnetically shielded because of the characteristic surroundings of the scanner room. During the experiment, the nonstimulated subject was placed in the scanner with sensory isolating goggles covering the subject's eyes. The stimulated subject was placed 30 feet away and sat in front of a video monitor that presented an alternating schedule of six stimulus-on/stimulus-off conditions. The stimulus-on condition consisted of a flickering checkerboard pattern whereas the stimulus-off condition consisted of a static checkerboard. Stimulus-on/-off conditions were presented in the sequence on/off/on/off/on/off. The duration of these intervals was randomly assigned but consistently provided a total of 150 seconds of flicker and 150 seconds of static. Sessions were repeated twice to assess possible replication of the phenomenon. Outcome measures: Changes in fMRI brain activation (relating to blood oxygenation) and EEG signals were measured in the nonstimulated subjects. Changes occurring during stimulus-on conditions were statistically compared to changes occurring during the stimulus-off conditions. Results: Statistically significant changes in fMRI brain activation and EEG signals were observed when comparing the stimulus-on condition to the stimulus-off condition in nonstimulated subjects (p &lt; 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons). For fMRI, these changes were observed in visual brain areas 18 and 19 (Brodmann areas). One of the subjects replicated the results. Conclusions: These data replicate previous findings suggesting that correlated neural signals may be detected by fMRI and EEG in the brains of subjects who are physically and sensorily isolated from each other. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-31144475636&amp;doi=10.1089%2facm.2005.11.955&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6ad8b7e33148a2f4caf373767b6e5692</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Opijnen, T.</author><author>Jeeninga, R.E.</author><author>Boerlijst, M.C.</author><author>Pollakis, G.P.</author><author>Zetterberg, V.</author><author>Salminen, M.</author><author>Berkhout, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Subtypes Have a Distinct Long Terminal Repeat That Determines the Replication Rate in a Host-Cell-Specific Manner</title><secondary-title>Journal of Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>3675-3683</pages><volume>78</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JVI.78.7.3675-3683.2004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The long terminal repeat (LTR) transcriptional promoters of different human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 subtypes were inserted into the LAI molecular clone of subtype B. The viral genotypes represent seven subtypes (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) and one circulating recombinant form (AG). We performed replication studies with this isogenic set of viruses across six cellular environments. This approach revealed strong cellular environment effects, but the method was not sensitive enough to detect small differences in the replication rate between the subtypes. By conducting pairwise competition experiments between the virus variants in six cellular environments, we could demonstrate significant differences in the replication rates of the subtypes and that LTR-determined viral fitness depends both on the host cell type and the activation state of the cell. In addition, we determined the degree of conservation of the transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS) in the different-subtype LTRs by analyzing sequences from the HIV sequence database. The sequence analyses revealed subtype-specific conservation of certain TFBS. The results indicate that one should consider the possibility of subtype-specific viral replication rates in vivo, which are strongly influenced by the host environment. We argue that the multidimensional host environment may have shaped the genetic structures of the subtype LTRs.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1842614352&amp;doi=10.1128%2fJVI.78.7.3675-3683.2004&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=eadbb6dc089bb13590fbbf36728b7cf4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ancona, N.</author><author>Maglietta, R.</author><author>Piepoli, A.</author><author>D'Addabbo, A.</author><author>Cotugno, R.</author><author>Savino, M.</author><author>Liuni, S.</author><author>Carella, M.</author><author>Pesole, G.</author><author>Perri, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the statistical assessment of classifiers using DNA microarray data</title><secondary-title>BMC Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-7-387</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: In this paper we present a method for the statistical assessment of cancer predictors which make use of gene expression profiles. The methodology is applied to a new data set of microarray gene expression data collected in Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, Foggia - Italy. The data set is made up of normal (22) and tumor (25) specimens extracted from 25 patients affected by colon cancer. We propose to give answers to some questions which are relevant for the automatic diagnosis of cancer such as: Is the size of the available data set sufficient to build accurate classifiers? What is the statistical significance of the associated error rates? In what ways can accuracy be considered dependant on the adopted classification scheme? How many genes are correlated with the pathology and how many are sufficient for an accurate colon cancer classification? The method we propose answers these questions whilst avoiding the potential pitfalls hidden in the analysis and interpretation of microarray data. Results: We estimate the generalization error, evaluated through the Leave-K-Out Cross Validation error, for three different classification schemes by varying the number of training examples and the number of the genes used. The statistical significance of the error rate is measured by using a permutation test. We provide a statistical analysis in terms of the frequencies of the genes involved in the classification. Using the whole set of genes, we found that the Weighted Voting Algorithm (WVA) classifier learns the distinction between normal and tumor specimens with 25 training examples, providing e = 21% (p = 0.045) as an error rate. This remains constant even when the number of examples increases. Moreover, Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers can learn with only 15 training examples, with an error rate of e = 19% (p = 0.035) and e = 18% (p = 0.037) respectively. Moreover, the error rate decreases as the training set size increases, reaching its best performances with 35 training examples. In this case, RLS and SVM have error rates of e = 14% (p = 0.027) and e = 11% (p = 0.019). Concerning the number of genes, we found about 6000 genes (p &lt; 0.05) correlated with the pathology, resulting from the signal-to-noise statistic. Moreover the performances of RLS and SVM classifiers do not change when 74% of genes is used. They progressively reduce up to e = 16% (p &lt; 0.05) when only 2 genes are employed. The biological relevance of a set of genes determined by our statistical analysis and the major roles they play in colorectal tumorigenesis is discussed. Conclusions: The method proposed provides statistically significant answers to precise questions relevant for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. We found that, with as few as 15 examples, it is possible to train statistically significant classifiers for colon cancer diagnosis. As for the definition of the number of genes sufficient for a reliable classification of colon cancer, our results suggest that it depends on the accuracy required. © 2006 Ancona et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33748684439&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1471-2105-7-387&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bf7cd04911c416e65b064d657ee8ce45</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dandona, L.</author><author>Lakshmi, V.</author><author>Kumar, G.A.</author><author>Dandona, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Is the HIV burden in India being overestimated?</title><secondary-title>BMC Public Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Public Health</full-title></periodical><volume>6</volume><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2458-6-308</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The HIV burden estimate for India has a very wide plausibility range. A recent population-based study in a south Indian district demonstrated that the official method used in India to estimate HIV burden in the population, which directly extrapolates annual sentinel surveillance data from large public sector antenatal and sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics, led to a 2-3 times higher estimate than that based on population-based data. Methods: We assessed the generalisability of the reasons found in the Guntur study for overestimation of HIV by the official sentinel surveillance based method: addition of substantial unnecessary HIV estimates from STI clinics, the common practice of referral of HIV positive/ suspect patients by private practitioners to public hospitals, and a preferential use of public hospitals by lower socioeconomic strata. We derived conservative correction factors for the sentinel surveillance data and titrated these to the four major HIV states in India (Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu), and examined the impact on the overall HIV estimate for India. Results: HIV data from STI clinics are not used elsewhere in the world as a component of HIV burden estimation in generalised epidemics, and the Guntur study verified that this was unnecessary. The referral of HIV positive/suspect patients from the private to the public sector is a widespread phenomenon in India, which is likely causing an upward distortion in HIV estimates from sentinel surveillance in other parts of India as well. Analysis of data from the nationwide Reproductive and Child Health Survey revealed that lower socioeconomic strata were over-represented among women seeking antenatal care at public hospitals in all major south Indian states, similar to the trend seen in the Guntur study. Application of conservative correction factors derived from the Guntur study reduced the 2005 official sentinel surveillance based HIV estimate of 3.7 million 15-49 years old persons in the four major states to 1.5-2.0 million, which would drop the official total estimate of 5.2 million 15-49 years old persons with HIV in India to 3-3.5 million. Conclusion: Plausible and cautious extrapolation of the trends seen in a recent large and rigorous population-based study of HIV in a south Indian district suggests that India is likely grossly overestimating its HIV burden with the current official sentinel surveillance based method.

Structurally related compounds that bind to the AhR and exhibit biological actions similar to TCDD are commonly referred to as "dioxin-like compounds" (DLCs). Ambient human exposure to DLCs occurs through the ingestion of foods containing residues of DLCs that bio-concentrate through the food chain. Due to their lipophilicity and persistence, once internalized they accumulate in body tissues, mainly adipose, resulting in chronic lifetime human exposure. Since human exposure to DLCs always occurs as a complex mixture, the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) methodology has been developed as a mathematical tool to assess the health risk posed by complex mixtures of these compounds. The TEF methodology is a relative potency scheme that ranks the dioxin-like activity of a compound relative to TCDD, the most potent congener. This allows for the estimation of the potential dioxin-like activity of a mixture of chemicals, based on a common mechanism of action involving an initial binding of DLCs to the AhR. The toxic equivalency of DLCs was nominated for evaluation because of the widespread human exposure to DLCs and the lack of data on the adequacy of the TEF methodology for predicting relative potency for cancer risk. To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. 2-YEAR STUDY: The 2-year study of a binary mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153 was designed to assess the carcinogenicity of a constant ratio mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153. In addition, varying ratio mixture groups were used to assess the impact of increasing PCB 153 on the carcinogenicity of PCB 126. Dose groups were divided into two study arms (Figure 1). TCDD equivalent (TEQ) doses are based on the PCB 126 doses after adjustment for the PCB 126 TEF of 0.1. Groups of 81 (Groups 2, 3, 5, and 7) or 80 (Groups 4 and 6) female rats received a mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153 in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage 5 days per week for up to 105 weeks; a group of 81 female rats received the corn oil:acetone (99:1) vehicle only and served as the vehicle control (Group 1). Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. Survival of all dosed groups was similar to that of the vehicle controls. The mean body weights of Groups 4 and 5 were generally less than those of the vehicle controls after week 25. The mean body weights of Group 6 were less after week 12, and those of Group 7 were less after week 8. Thyroid Hormone Concentrations: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. In the constant ratio groups, serum total thyroxine (T(4)) and free T(4) generally showed a treatment-related decrease relative to controls. Serum total triiodothyronine (T(3)) exhibited a treatment-related increase at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations, but serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were increased at the 14-week time point only. In the varying ratio groups, the decrease in total and free T(4) was more pronounced in those groups dosed with the increasing proportion of PCB 153 at the 31- and 53-week time points. Hepatic Cell Proliferation Data: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was conducted at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. At 31 and 53 weeks, a significant increase in the hepatocellular labeling index occurred in Group 7. In the varying ratio groups, the labeling index at the 53-week interim time point was significantly higher in Group 6, which had the highest proportion of PCB 153 compared to the other varying ratio groups. Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Activities: To evaluate the expression of known PCB 126-responsive genes, CYP1A1-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide-4-hydroxylase (A4H) activities were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. In addition, PCB 153-inducible CYP2B-associated 7-pent-oxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) activity was analyzed. In the constant ratio Groups 2, 3, 5, and 7, hepatic and pulmonary EROD (CYP1A1) activities, hepatic A4H (CYP1A2) activities, and hepatic PROD (CYP2B) activities were significantly greater in all dosed groups compared to the vehicle controls at weeks 14, 31, and 53. In the varying ratio groups, hepatic EROD, A4H, and PROD activities at 14 weeks were higher in groups receiving a greater proportion of PCB 153 in the PCB mixture. At 31 and 53 weeks, hepatic CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 enzyme activities in Group 6 were generally lower than in Groups 4 and 5. Determinations of PCB 126 and PCB 153 Concentrations in Tissues: Concentrations of PCB 126 and PCB 153 were determined in fat, liver, lung, and blood at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations and at the end of the 2-year study (105 weeks). PCB 126 was not detectable in vehicle control animals, but increased with increasing dose of PCB 126 and duration of exposure; the highest concentrations were found in liver and fat, and lower levels were seen in lung and blood. Increasing the proportion of PCB 153 in the mixture relative to PCB 126 led to a general decrease in the amount of PCB 126 in liver and lung at the later time points, whereas in fat and blood, there was generally either no effect of PCB 153 on the disposition of PCB 126, or there was an increase in the amount of PCB 126 in the tissue. In vehicle control animals, PCB 153 was detectable in the fat at all time points, in the lung at all time points except 53 weeks, and in the liver and blood at 2 years. PCB 153 was measurable in all examined tissues of treated animals, with the highest concentrations found in fat at the end of the 2-year study in groups administered the highest doses of PCB 153. Pathology and Statistical Analyses -- Constant Ratio Mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153: At 14, 31, and 53 weeks, the absolute and relative liver weights of all dosed groups were generally greater than those of the vehicle controls. Exposure to the PCB mixture led to significant toxicity in the liver. At 14 weeks, the incidences of several nonneoplastic liver lesions were increased compared to the vehicle controls including hepatocyte hypertrophy, pigmentation, multinucleated hepatocytes, and diffuse fatty change. The spectrum and severity of effects increased with dose and duration of exposure. At the end of the 2-year study, there were significantly increased incidences and severities of toxic hepatopathy characterized by hepatocyte hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, pigmentation, diffuse and focal fatty change, eosinophilic focus, nodular hyperplasia, cholangiofibrosis, oval cell hyperplasia, bile duct cysts, bile duct hyperplasia, necrosis, and portal fibrosis. Significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatocholangioma were observed in the study. In addition, two animals in the highest dose group had hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidences of these lesions generally exceeded the historical vehicle control ranges. At 2 years, a significantly increased incidence of cystic keratinizing epithelioma of the lung was observed in Group 7. In addition, single occurrences of squamous cell carcinoma were seen in the top two dose groups. Nonneoplastic effects whose incidences were increased in the lung included bronchiolar metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium and squamous metaplasia. Significantly increased incidences of squamous cell carcinoma (gingival) of the oral mucosa were seen at the end of the 2-year study and were accompanied by increased incidences of gingival squamous hyperplasia. In the pancreas at 53 weeks, the incidence of acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization was significantly increased in the highest dose group. At 2 years, increased incidences of acinar atrophy and acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization were seen in addition to pancreatic acinar neoplasms in dosed groups. In Groups 5 and 7, these incidences exceeded the historical vehicle control ranges. In the uterus at 2 years, there was a marginal increase in the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma in Group 5. Numerous nonneoplastic effects were seen in other organs at the interim time points including atrophy of the thymus and follicular cell hypertrophy of the thyroid gland. These responses were also affected by administration of the mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153 at the end of the 2-year study and were accompanied by additional nonneoplastic responses in numerous organs including atrophy of the adrenal cortex and cortical hyperplasia, severity of nephropathy, and incidences of pigmentation of the kidney. Other nonneoplastic lesions that were treatment related were forestomach hyperplasia, hyperplasia of the nasal respiratory epithelium, metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium, and ectasia of the mandibular lymph node. Varying Ratio Mixture of PCB 126 and PCB 153: An effect of increasing the proportion of PCB 153 in the PCB mixture was seen in several tissues, most notably in the liver. Treatment-related nonneoplastic effects seen across the varying ratio groups were generally the same as those seen in the constant ratio groups. In general there was a positive effect of PCB 153 in the mixture on the incidences and severities of these lesions with higher incidences and higher severities being seen in Group 6, which had the highest proportion of PCB 153.

Classic shell tempering is first represented in the Mockley series, variously interpreted as evidence of the first Algonquian migratory event or local innovation, appearing on the Delmarva Peninsula about A.D. 100 and subsequently on Maryland's Western Shore and in Tidewater Virginia. The tradition of shell tempering reaches its zenith in the region as the Townsend series, generally understood as the ceramic tradition of Algonquian immigrants to the middle Atlantic region about A.D. 800. The use of shell as temper continues into the historic era as Colono-Indian ware of Tidewater Virginia. Replication experiments evaluating the practical implications of shell tempering indicate that the appearance, adoption, and geographic distribution of this technology in the middle Atlantic necessarily accompanied low-temperature firing techniques. Results suggest that long-held views regarding the necessity of prefiring shell are unfounded but confirm other aspects of traditional archaeological assumptions about the technological process derived from materials science studies.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-60849085439&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d06c65a4e7c3d77f93742e598a77e354</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marconi, V.</author><author>Bonhoeffer, S.</author><author>Paredes, R.</author><author>Lu, J.</author><author>Hoh, R.</author><author>Martin, J.N.</author><author>Deeks, S.G.</author><author>Kuritzkes, D.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Viral dynamics and in vivo fitness of HIV-1 in the presence and absence of enfuvirtide</title><secondary-title>Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes</full-title></periodical><pages>572-576</pages><volume>48</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/QAI.0b013e31817bbc4e</electronic-resource-num><abstract>OBJECTIVES:: To estimate the in vivo fitness cost of enfuvirtide (ENF) resistance, we analyzed dynamic shifts in the HIV-1 quasispecies under changing selective pressure in 3 subjects on failing ENF-based regimens who interrupted ENF while maintaining stable background regimens. Subsequently, ENF was readministered for 4 weeks as "pulse intensification." METHODS:: The proportion of plasma virus carrying the V38A mutation in gp41 was quantified by allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction in serial samples collected from 3 subjects at 1- to 4-week intervals. Fitness differences were calculated using a method that corrected for time dependence of the viral replication rate. RESULTS:: The V38A mutant made up 85% of the quasispecies at baseline and decayed to &lt;5% over 12-24 weeks; plasma HIV-1 RNA levels remained stable during this time. Fitness differences for mutant versus wild type ranged from -25% to -65%, providing in vivo evidence for the reduced fitness of ENF-resistant HIV-1. The V38A mutant virus reemerged rapidly during the ENF pulse. CONCLUSIONS:: These results demonstrate that the HIV-1 quasispecies undergoes dynamic changes in response to withdrawal and reinitiation of fusion inhibitor therapy. The relative stability of plasma HIV-1 titers during decay of V38A suggests that factors other than viral fitness likely define viral load set-point in patients with advanced disease. © 2008 by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-50949118572&amp;doi=10.1097%2fQAI.0b013e31817bbc4e&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9c6a8ffbd6ac2fda1d8f8d0a4e3e6283</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brozovic, M.</author><author>Knesaurek, N.</author><author>Osterman, D.P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The influence of image capturing systems on artwork reproduction</title><secondary-title>Journal of Imaging Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><pages>240-245</pages><volume>48</volume><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Can we assess artwork reproduction from the standpoint of properly adjusted image management process? This study integrates the analysis of artwork reproductions obtained by three different image capturing systems. The artwork examined in this study belongs to the bright-shadow, visually presentable category and the reproduction quality analysis was performed visually and instrumentally. The visual study included formal/methodological characteristics of the artwork. The purpose of this research is to determine whether there is any correlation between subjective and objective reproduction assessment when using different image capturing systems. Based on the results acquired, it has been shown that brightness is decisive for quality reproduction. This finding has been confirmed by instrumental measurement and visual evaluation. However, artwork that belongs to different visually presentable systems may require other criteria for the evaluation of quality artwork reproduction.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-4043176140&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=47dc06abe1e78509083c7349b5797645</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biellmann, F.</author><author>Henion, T.R.</author><author>Bürki, K.</author><author>Hennet, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impaired sexual behavior in male mice deficient for the β1-3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I gene</title><secondary-title>Molecular Reproduction and Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Reproduction and Development</full-title></periodical><pages>699-706</pages><volume>75</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/mrd.20828</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The β1-3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (B3gnt1) gene encodes a poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthase which can initiate and extend poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains [Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc (β1-3)n]. Previous investigations with heterozygous and homozygous null mice for this gene have revealed the importance of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains for the formation of olfactory axon connections with the olfactory bulb and the migration of gonadotropin releasing hormone neurons to the hypothalamus. The possible long-term effects of these developmental defects, however, has not yet been studied. Here we have examined a reproductive phenotype observed in B3gnt1-null mice. Whereas the B3gnt1 null females were fertile, the B3gnt1 null males were not able to sire litters at the expected rate when mated to either wildtype or B3gnt1-null females. We assessed male sexual behavior as well as male reproduction parameters such as testes size, spermatogenesis, sperm number, morphology, and the development of early embryos in order to identify the source of a reduced rate of reproduction. Our findings show that the B3gnt1 null male reproductive organs were functional and could not account for the lower rate at which they produced offspring with wildtype conspecifics. Hence, we propose that the phenotype observed resulted from an impaired sexual response to female mating partners. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-41149095249&amp;doi=10.1002%2fmrd.20828&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b35f59210cfe41362fe08eb691c31875</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidgall, M.</author><author>Joseph, L.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of phonic analysis and whole word-reading on first graders' cumulative words read and cumulative reading rate: An extension in examining instructional effectiveness and efficiency</title><secondary-title>Psychology in the Schools</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychology in the Schools</full-title></periodical><pages>319-332</pages><volume>44</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/pits.20227</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study compared the instructional effectiveness and efficiency of three word-reading interventions on cumulative number of words read accurately and cumulative learning rate. Participants were six first graders who needed intensive intervention services. Alternating treatment designs were used to compare the effects of interspersal drill, a phonic analysis method consisting of word boxes (WB), and traditional drill and practice procedure on word-reading performance. The current study extended this line of inquiry by including a phonic analysis condition and a measure of generalization. Results revealed that four students' cumulative word-reading performances were greater under the phonic analysis condition. However, all students' cumulative rate of reading words was greater under the traditional drill and practice condition.

The package is capable of processing roads and buildings. Through support programs, several benefits were gained, including a reliable data conversion between the internal file format of the package and DXF, improved geometric quality of the building data before generalization, and statistical evaluation of generalization results. Because the package runs in batch mode, the ACAD MAP CAD and GIS software package was used as a graphic interface, which has more functionality than a simple interface in this study. The paper introduces a generalization approach which can be implemented in a practical setting. An overview of the results of the case study shows the evident applicability of this approach.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1842628599&amp;doi=10.1559%2f152304004773112767&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8948623481871188b6391baaa97a7d6a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashouri, A.</author><author>Arzanian, N.</author><author>Askary, H.</author><author>Rasoulian, G.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pathogenicity of the fungus, Verticillium lecanii, to the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Hom.: Aphididae).</title><secondary-title>Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>205-209</pages><volume>69</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Pathogenicity of the hyphomycete, Verticillium lecanii (DAOM 198499), was investigated to aphid, Myzus persicae under laboratory conditions.

The models are a non-hydrostatic cloud-system-resolving atmospheric model with a horizontal grid size of 5 km (5km-NHM) utilized as a regional climate model (RCM), and an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) with a horizontal resolution of about 20 km (20km-AGCM) which provided the boundary condition of 5km-NHM. Ten-year runs were performed by the time-slice method. The mean precipitation amount of the three heaviest precipitation events that ranked in order of precipitation amount in every year (PTop3) at each grid point was used as an index to examine quantitatively extreme precipitation within a specific term with various precipitation accumulation periods (APs). The 5km-NHM experiment reproduced PTop3 much better than that of 20km-AGCM, especially for shorter APs. In the projection of PTop3 in the future climate with 5km-NHM, ratio in two climate states of PTop3 for longer APs and that of precipitation amount show the roughly same pattern. The increase areas of those were localized around Kyushu, Japan. In particular, the PTop3 for longer APs was projected to increase 30-70% in the mountainous areas along the Pacific coast of western Japan. This increase was due to a cyclonic circulation of an incremental low-pressure generated on the western side of Kyushu. On the other hand, large increases of PTop3 for shorter APs spread widely with a scattered pattern to the area where precipitation decreases. This characteristic was associated with the intensification of precipitation due to global warming. © 2008, Meteorological Society of Japan.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-65749100571&amp;doi=10.2151%2fjmsj.86.951&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2952ece13ab793a26eae8d33d7786b5b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daar, E.S.</author><author>Kesler, K.L.</author><author>Wrin, T.</author><author>Petropoulo, C.J.</author><author>Bates, M.</author><author>Lail, A.</author><author>Hellmann, N.S.</author><author>Gomperts, E.</author><author>Donfield, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>HIV-1 pol replication capacity predicts disease progression</title><secondary-title>AIDS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AIDS</full-title></periodical><pages>871-877</pages><volume>19</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/01.aids.0000171400.15619.e1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: To determine the influence of pol replication capacity on the natural history of HIV-1 infection. Design: Pol replication capacity was measured using a recombinant virus single cycle assay on baseline plasma specimens from subjects enrolled in the Hemophilia Growth and Development Study. Setting: Children and adolescents with hemophilia and HIV-1 infection were enrolled at multiple sites across the USA into a natural history study. Participants: The Hemophilia Growth and Development Study enrolled 207 HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs between 6 and 19 years of age in 1989 and 1990. Subjects were followed every 6 months through 1997 with pol replication capacity measurements available from 128 of the subjects. Main outcome measures: A univariate model defined the relationship between pol replication capacity and HIV-1 RNA and CD4 T-cell number. A random effects model assessed the ability of this measure to predict CD4 T-cell decline over time and a Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier analyses defined how it predicts clinical progression. Results: Pol replication capacity measures correlated with baseline HIV-1 RNA, R2 = 0.189 (P = 0.03) and CD4 T-cell number, -0.197 (P = 0.03). It also independently predicted CD4 T-cell decline over time and progression to AIDS.

Structurally related compounds that bind to the AhR and exhibit biological actions similar to TCDD are commonly referred to as "dioxin-like compounds" (DLCs). Ambient human exposure to DLCs occurs through the ingestion of foods containing residues of DLCs that bioconcentrate through the food chain. Due to their lipophilicity and persistence, once internalized they accumulate in human tissues, mainly adipose, resulting in chronic lifetime human exposure. Since human exposure to DLCs always involves a complex mixture, the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) methodology has been developed as a mathematical tool to assess the health risk posed by complex mixtures of these compounds. The TEF methodology is a relative potency scheme that ranks the dioxin-like activity of a compound relative to TCDD, which is the most potent congener. This allows for the estimation of the potential dioxin-like activity of a mixture of chemicals, based on a common mechanism of action involving an initial binding of DLCs to the AhR. The toxic equivalency of DLCs was nominated for evaluation because of the widespread human exposure to DLCs and the lack of data on the adequacy of the TEF methodology for predicting relative potency for cancer risk. To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. 2,3,4,7,8-Pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is not manufactured commercially other than for scientific research purposes. The main sources of PeCDF releases into the environment are from combustion and incineration sources. PeCDF was selected for study by the National Toxicology Program as a part of the dioxin TEF evaluation to assess the cancer risk posed by complex mixtures of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and PCBs. The dioxin TEF evaluation includes conducting multiple 2-year rat bioassays to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs, structurally related PCBs, and mixtures of these compounds. While one of the aims of the dioxin TEF evaluation was a comparative analysis across studies, in this Technical Report only the results of the present PeCDF study are presented and discussed. Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were administered PeCDF (at least 97% pure) in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 14, 31, or 53 weeks or 2 years. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of 81 female rats were administered 6, 20, 44, 92, or 200 ng PeCDF/kg body weight in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage, 5 days per week, for up to 105 weeks; a group of 81 vehicle control female rats received the corn oil/acetone vehicle alone. Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. A stop-exposure group was administered 200 ng/kg PeCDF in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 30 weeks and then the vehicle for the remainder of the study. The PeCDF in this study was at least 97% pure. Survival of dosed groups was similar to that of the vehicle control group. Mean body weights of the 200 ng/kg core and stop-exposure groups were less than those of the vehicle controls during year 2 of the study. Thyroid Hormone Concentrations: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels were evaluated at the 14-, 31- and 53-week interim evaluations. There were significant decreases in total serum thyroxine (T(4)) levels at the 14-week interim evaluation. There were no significant differences observed in serum free T(4), total triiodothyronine (T(3)), or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) at 14 weeks. At both 31 and 53 weeks, there were treatment-related decreases in free and total T(4) concentrations and increases in serum T(3) levels. Serum TSH levels in dosed groups at 31 and 53 weeks were not significantly different than in the vehicle controls. Hepatic Cell Proliferation Data: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was conducted at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. At 14 and 53 weeks, hepatocyte BrdU-labeling indices were significantly higher in the 200 ng/kg groups compared to time-matched vehicle controls. No significant differences were observed between the dosed groups and vehicle controls at 31 weeks. Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Activities: To evaluate the expression of known dioxin-responsive genes, CYP1A1-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide-4-hydroxylase (A4H) activity were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. Hepatic EROD and A4H activities were significantly higher in all groups administered PeCDF relative to the vehicle controls at all three interim evaluations. Pulmonary EROD was also significantly higher in all dosed groups compared to vehicle controls at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. Determinations of PeCDF Concentrations in Tissues: The tissue disposition of PeCDF was analyzed in the liver, lung, fat, and blood of all animals at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations, and in 10 animals per group at the end of the 2-year study (105 weeks). In the liver of vehicle controls, PeCDF concentrations were detectable at 105 weeks. Measurable concentrations of PeCDF were not detected in fat or lung from vehicle control rats at any of the interim evaluations or at 105 weeks. Hepatic and fat concentrations were higher in groups with increasing doses of PeCDF, demonstrating a dose-related increase in tissue burden of PeCDF at each time point. No measurable concentrations of PeCDF were detected in the lungs of vehicle controls or any of the dosed groups at 14 weeks or in the lungs of the vehicle control group at 31, 53, and 105 weeks, or the 6 ng/kg group at 31 and 53 weeks. In groups with measurable levels, PeCDF concentrations were higher with respect to increasing doses. Mean levels of PeCDF in the liver, fat, lung, and blood in the 200 ng/kg group at the end of the 2-year study were 500 ng/g, 7.75 ng/g, 0.28 ng/g and 0.04 ng/mL, respectively. Negligible PeCDF concentrations were observed in blood of the 200 ng/kg group at 53 weeks and the 92 and 200 ng/kg groups at 105 weeks. In liver and fat from the stop-exposure group, the PeCDF concentrations were between the levels observed in the 6 and 20 ng/kg groups. In the stop-exposure group, PeCDF concentration in lung was comparable to levels observed in the 6 ng/kg group. No measurable concentrations were observed in blood from the stop-exposure group. Pathology and Statistical Analyses: There were dose-dependent increases in both absolute and relative liver weights at 4, 31, and 53 weeks, and these tended to correlate with increased incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. In the liver at 14 weeks, the only significant effect was an increase in the incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. At 53 weeks, there were significant increases in the incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy and pigmentation. At 2 years, there were significant dose-dependent trends for increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and cholangiocarcinoma of the liver. A significant dose-dependent increase in hepatic toxicity was observed and was characterized by increased incidences of numerous nonneoplastic lesions including hepatocellular hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, oval cell hyperplasia, diffuse fatty change, pigmentation, nodular hyperplasia, eosinophilic foci, hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia, bile duct fibrosis, cholangiofibrosis, and toxic hepatopathy. At 2 years, three gingival squamous cell carcinomas of the oral mucosa were seen in the 200 ng/kg core and stop-exposure groups, two occurred in the 6 ng/kg group, and one occurred in each of the vehicle control, 20 ng/kg, and 92 ng/kg groups. Gingival squamous hyperplasia occurred in all groups including the vehicle controls, with increasing incidences in groups administered 44 ng/kg or greater. The incidence of carcinoma of the uterus was marginally increased in the 92 ng/kg group at 2 years. Increased incidences of chronic active inflammation of the uterus were observed in all dosed groups, and the incidence in the 200 ng/kg stop-exposure group was greater than those in the vehicle control and 200 ng/kg core study groups. Increased incidences of squamous metaplasia of the uterus occurred in all dosed groups. In the 200 ng/kg stop-exposure group, the incidence of squamous metaplasia was significantly greater than that in the vehicle controls, but was lower than that in the 200 ng/kg core study group. At 14-weeks, lung weights were significantly increased in the 200 ng/kg group compared to the vehicle controls. A single occurrence of a multiple cystic keratinizing epithelioma of the lung was observed in the 200 ng/kg core study group. There were increases in the incidences of bronchiolar metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium and sporadic incidences of squamous metaplasia. One pancreatic acinar adenoma and one pancreatic acinar carcinoma were each observed in the 92 ng/kg group and in the 200 ng/kg stop-exposure group at 2 years. Significantly increased incidences of acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization and arterial chronic active inflammation and increased severity of chronic active inflammation were observed in the 200 ng/kg core study group. Numerous nonneoplastic effects were seen in other organs including thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy, thymic atrophy, adrenal cortex cystic degeneration, nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, and squamous hyperplasia of the forestomach.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928699109&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0b2c1bd654f8fd8dfd10e219a622f5e1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, H.-P.</author><author>Yan, W.-J.</author><author>Li, J.</author><author>Zhang, C.</author><author>Zhao, R.-L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical characters of the progression from childhood ocular to generalized myasthenia gravis</title><secondary-title>Chinese Journal of Neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese Journal of Neurology</full-title></periodical><pages>827-830</pages><volume>41</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Objective: To investigate the rate and the time of generalization from childhood ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG), and the preventive effect of prednisone on the progression of OMG to generalized myasthenia of gravis (GMG). Methods: Retrospective study of medical data from 978 childhood patients with OMG and 1359 adult patients with OMG during a follow-up period of 1-28 years (mean 7.5 years) who were diagnosed and treated in Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao Medical College from 1977 to 2005.. Results: The generalized rate of childhood OMG and adult OMG was 13.0% (127/978) and 67.2% (913/1359) respectively (X 2 =674.17, P &lt; 0.01). Of 127 childhood OMG patients who had become generalized form, 74 patients (58.3%) developed generalized form in the first 2 years from the onset; Of 913 adult OMG patients who had become generalized form, 763 patients (83.6%) did (X 2 = 45.39, P &lt; 0.01). Of 456 childhood OMG patients treated with prednisone, only 5 patients (1.1%) became generalized form; Of 522 childhood OMG patients never treated with prednisone, 122 patients (23.4%) developed the generalized form (X 2 = 104.9, P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: The rate of generalization of childhood OMG is significantly decreased than that of adult OMG. The frequency of generalization of childhood OMG in the first 2 years from the onset is significantly lowered than adult OMG. Prednisone does reduce the chance of generalization from childhood OMG.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860896820&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=06ba15623b4dffb2768508ca610a11bf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, X.</author><author>Kamili, S.</author><author>Krawczynski, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitative detection of hepatitis E virus RNA and dynamics of viral replication in experimental infection</title><secondary-title>Journal of Viral Hepatitis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Viral Hepatitis</full-title></periodical><pages>835-839</pages><volume>13</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2893.2006.00754.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA has been detected in the stool and serum of patients with HEV infection and experimentally infected nonhuman primates. However, dynamics of HEV levels in the stool and serum during clinical and subclinical infections have not been determined. A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay, using SYBR Green I in a LightCycler, was developed and optimized to allow quantification of HEV RNA in the stool and serum of both genotype 1 and 2 isolates. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by testing known HEV-RNA-positive and -negative stool and serum specimens and the sensitivity was evaluated using a synthetic HEV RNA standard. Profiles of viraemia and faecal shedding in two chimpanzees inoculated with an isolate of HEV genotype 1 showed the appearance of virus in the stools on day 4 postinoculation (5.65-6.85 log copies/mg) and in the serum on day 7 postinoculation (6.0-6.93 log copies/mL). Peak HEV RNA levels in the stool and serum coincided with peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels observed on day 22 postinoculation in the two chimpanzees. At the time of detection of IgG anti-HEV in serum, viral RNA was no longer detectable in the stool or serum and ALT values had returned to normal levels in both chimpanzees, suggesting the efficacy of the immune response in terminating viral replication. Quantitative evaluation of HEV RNA in humans may allow determining the role of virus levels in the pathogenesis and transmission of HEV. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33751012738&amp;doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2893.2006.00754.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=368a127816e405f706bad81cbfd9c3df</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Muñoz, L.D.</author><author>Serramía, M.J.</author><author>Fresno, M.</author><author>Muñoz-Fernández, M.Á.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Progesterone inhibits HIV-1 replication in human trophoblast cells through inhibition of autocrine tumor necrosis factor secretion</title><secondary-title>Journal of Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>1294-1302</pages><volume>195</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/513434</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background. Progesterone levels are higher in placental barriers during pregnancy, but the effect of progesterone on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in placental cells has not been addressed. We hypothesize that progesterone may affect HIV infection. Methods. Purified trophoblastic cells and trophoblastic cell lines were infected or transfected with HIV-1, and the effect of progesterone was analyzed. Viral replication was measured by viral p24 or viral load quantification. Nuclear factor κ-B (NF-κB) or long terminal repeat (LTR)-dependent transcription was measured by luciferase assays. Expression of chemokine receptors was analyzed by flow cytometry. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) messenger RNA was assessed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR. Results. Progesterone inhibits HIV-1 replication in placental cells at the concentration found in the placental interface, at a postentry step, and does not affect cell surface expression of chemokine receptors. Progesterone did not inhibit basal or induced LTR transcription or NF-κB activation. TNF synthesis in placental cells is induced by HIV-1 infection that, in an autocrine manner, activates viral replication, because neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies block it. Progesterone inhibits the induction of TNF synthesis by viral infection and virus or gp-120-induced TNF transcription. Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that progesterone inhibits HIV-1 replication in placental cells by reducing TNF levels, which are required for optimal viral replication. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Subjects and setting: The subjects consisted of 921 15-year-old Czech pupils (508 girls and 413 boys). The data, extracted from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children International data archive, were collected using structured questionnaire in school environment. Statistical analysis: Relations among variables based on an estimate of the asymptotic sampling covariance matrix of the polychoric sample correlations, were analyzed by structural equation modeling using Generally Weighted Least Square iterative procedure. Results: Analysis of data using SEM brought acceptable support for the proposed model assuming effect of emotional support and family cohesion on the relationships among life satisfaction, somatic/psychic problems and adaptation to school environment. Model accounted for 31% and 35% of variance of boys and girls life satisfaction, respectively. The magnitude of congruence between the model and the data was noteworthy. Indices reflect that the model fits well and was also, apart from interfactor correlations and notably from error variances, gender invariant. Standardized effects of emotional support and family cohesion on the life satisfaction, and family cohesion on adaptation to school environment were very similar and statistically significant for both groups. Nevertheless, it seems that life satisfaction of girls is noticeably more strongly associated with the degree of perceived emotional support, and also their adaptation to school environment could be more potent source of somatic/ psychic problem in comparison to boys. Study limitation: Structural equation models are essentially correlational in nature. Consequently, even with adequate fit indices and the explanation of a large proportion of variance in the criterion construct, other models could be equally viable. The present study is subject to several limitations. First, the findings require replication with an independent sample. Second, because the data relied on self-report measures, replication studies that include third-party observations of the participants' behavior would be desirable.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34547444476&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0b286fed2e3094fea1b58b6b65a711f4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Evanschitzky, H.</author><author>Baumgarth, C.</author><author>Hubbard, R.</author><author>Armstrong, J.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication research's disturbing trend</title><secondary-title>Journal of Business Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Business Research</full-title></periodical><pages>411-415</pages><volume>60</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jbusres.2006.12.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Researchers express concern over a paucity of replications.

Results show that the replication rate has fallen to 1.2%, a decrease in the rate by half. As things now stand, practitioners should be skeptical about using the results published in marketing journals as hardly any of them have been successfully replicated, teachers should ignore the findings until they receive support via replications and researchers should put little stock in the outcomes of one-shot studies. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, we answer to precise questions: how many gene expression levels are correlated with the pathology and how many are sufficient for an accurate classification? The proposed method provides answer to these questions avoiding the potential pitfalls hidden in the analysis of microarray data. We have evaluated the generalization error, estimated through the Leave-K-Out Cross Validation error, of two different classification schemes by varying the number of selected genes. We found that, Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers, using the whole gene set, have error rates of e = 14% (p = 0.023) and e = 11% (p = 0.016) respectively. Concerning the number of genes, the performances of RLS and SVM classifiers do not change when the 74% of genes is used. The statistical significance was measured by using permutation test. ©2006 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-48649094295&amp;doi=10.1109%2fGENSIPS.2006.353180&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e37ff2826f1408fae7081daf09a00243</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cloete, S.W.P.</author><author>Gilmour, A.R.</author><author>Olivier, J.J.</author><author>Van Wyk, J.B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic and phenotypic trends and parameters in reproduction, greasy fleece weight and liveweight in Merino lines divergently selected for multiple rearing ability</title><secondary-title>Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture</full-title></periodical><pages>745-754</pages><volume>44</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/EA02225</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genetic and phenotypic trends and parameters were estimated for reproduction, fleece weight and liveweight in a South African Merino population, divergently selected from 1986, either for (H line) or against (L line) maternal multiple rearing ability. Annual reproduction, ewe greasy fleece weight and pre-joining liveweight data were recorded on 809 Merino ewes, from 1986 to 2002. Phenotypic trends indicated divergence in reproduction traits between the H and L lines. The direct additive variance ratio (h2 ± s.e.) for day of lambing was 0.08 ± 0.02. Estimates of h2 for reproduction traits were: 0.10 ± 0.02 for number of lambs born per ewe; 0.04 ± 0.02 for number of lambs weaned per ewe; and 0.04 ± 0.02 for weight of lamb weaned per ewe, corrected for the gender of the lamb. Corresponding h2 estimates for annual production were 0.57 ± 0.06 for greasy fleece weight and 0.48 ± 0.06 for ewe liveweight at joining. Service sire only exerted a significant (P&lt;0.05) effect on day of lambing, but it accounted for merely 2% of the overall phenotypic variation. Ewe permanent environment variance ratios (c2ewe) for the reproduction traits were: 0.07 ± 0.03 for number of lambs born per ewe; 0.11 ± 0.03 for number of lambs weaned per ewe; and 0.11 ± 0.03 for total weight of lamb weaned per ewe. Corresponding c2 ewe estimates for annual production traits were 0.14 ± 0.05 for greasy fleece weight and 0.27 ± 0.06 for ewe joining weight. Genetic and ewe permanent environmental correlations between measures of reproduction exceeded 0.7. Genetic correlations of reproduction traits with greasy fleece weight were low and variable in sign. Genetic correlations of reproduction traits with ewe joining weight were positive and particularly high for weight of lamb weaned. Permanent environmental correlations of reproduction traits with greasy fleece weight and joining weight were generally low to moderate. Genetic trends for the H and L lines (derived from averaged direct breeding values within birth years) were divergent (P&lt;0.01) for all reproduction traits. Expressed as percentage of the overall least squares means of the respective traits, breeding values in the H line increased annually, with 1.3% for lambs born per ewe, 1.5% for lambs weaned per ewe and by 1.8% for weight of lamb weaned per ewe. Corresponding trends in the L line were, respectively, -0.6%, -1.0% and -1.2% per year. Substantial genetic progress in annual lamb output was attainable, despite relatively small h2 estimates. This response was achieved without unfavourable genetic changes in wool and liveweight.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-7044263229&amp;doi=10.1071%2fEA02225&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=aabafce7688edb2ecb8b29843f02fcd9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Orsel, K.</author><author>de Jong, M.C.M.</author><author>Bouma, A.</author><author>Stegeman, J.A.</author><author>Dekker, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Foot and mouth disease virus transmission among vaccinated pigs after exposure to virus shedding pigs</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title></periodical><pages>6381-6391</pages><volume>25</volume><number>34</number><issue>34</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.06.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this study was to design a transmission experiment that enabled quantification of the effectiveness of vaccination against foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus in groups of pigs. Previous experiments showed that intradermal injection of pigs with FMD virus 14 days after vaccination was not suitable to start an infection chain, as inoculated vaccinated pigs resisted challenge. Therefore, we carried out two experiments in which we used direct contact to a non-vaccinated pig as route of infection. In the first experiment only the vaccine effect on susceptibility was quantified by exposing pigs, either vaccinated 14 days before or not vaccinated, each to a non-vaccinated seeder pig inoculated with FMD virus O/NET/2001. Since no significant differences were observed between contact infections in vaccinated or non-vaccinated pigs, we performed a second experiment in which both susceptibility and infectivity were subject to vaccination. We quantified virus transmission in homogenous groups of vaccinated or non-vaccinated pigs in which the infection chain was started by exposure to a third group of non-vaccinated infected pigs. Transmission occurred to all contact-exposed pigs in the non-vaccinated groups and to 9 out of 10 contact-exposed pigs in the vaccinated groups. The rate of transmission (β) was significantly reduced in the vaccine group. Yet, the estimated reproduction ratio in both groups was still above 1. In conclusion, by adjusting our transmission study design and challenge method, we were able to quantify transmission of FMDV among vaccinated pigs. According to this study a single vaccination was not sufficient to stop pig to pig virus transmission. With these results major outbreaks may still be expected, even in groups of vaccinated pigs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The foundation of automatic target recognition is based upon pattern recognition. In this paper, we present new pattern recognition conceptsspecifically in the area of classification-and propose a new visualization technique that allows one to determine when a classifier is being arrogant. Clearly, arrogance in classification is an undesirable attribute. A human is being arrogant when their expressed conviction in a decision overstates their actual experience in making similar decisions. Likewise, given an input feature vector we say a classifier is arrogant in its classification if its veracity is high yet its experience is low. Conversely, a classifier is non-arrogant in its classification if there is a reasonable balance between its veracity and its experience. It is possible to quantify this balance and we discuss new techniques that will detect arrogance in a classifier. We show that single-hidden layer perceptrons are arrogant in their classification of certain regions in a feature space. When a classifier has been optimized to perform well on truthed data, one hopes that the classifier will perform well on operational (unknown) data. If a classifier performs well on new, previously-unseen data then we say that the classifier generalizes well. Quantifying this generalization performance has several approaches, as the literature shows, including holdout methods, boosting and bagging. In a departure from these stochastic approaches, we use 4-value logic to quantify generalization performance. Four-value logic is a simplified expression of both veracity and experience. For a multilayer perceptron (MLP), we detail where in feature space the classifier is arrogant and where it is non-arrogant. Our analysis yields new evaluation tools for the MLP and paves the way for other classifiers. The specific tools for the multilayer perceptron are based upon combinatorial geometry techniques that have existed for more than a decade, but are just now being exploited in the computational intelligence community. The benefits of our 4-value logic technique over other iterative and stochastic methods include the following: (1) Our technique evaluates the generalization of an MLP after model selection, requiring only the classifier's weights and biases and the data used to train these parameters. Iterative methods require that the evaluation of generalization take place over multiple training runs prior to the selection of a specific model; then, once a model is selected, the estimation of generalization for the selected model is optimistic. (2) The results of our evaluation do not change based on the order that data are presented. (3) Stochastic techniques exercise very little use of the domain, that is, the measure of the set of feature vectors used is zero. For our technique, the measure of such sets used is positive. © 2003 IEEE.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879385006&amp;doi=10.1109%2fAERO.2003.1235130&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1db1401030330bb7ff167f08d95dc32a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><titles><title>Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of a mixture of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (Cas No. 1746-01-6), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) (Cas No. 57117-31-4), and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) (Cas No. 57465-28-8) in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (gavage studies)</title><secondary-title>National Toxicology Program technical report series</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>National Toxicology Program technical report series</full-title></periodical><pages>1-180</pages><number>526</number><issue>526</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>DIOXIN TOXIC EQUIVALENCY FACTOR EVALUATION OVERVIEW: Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have the ability to bind to and activate the ligand-activated transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Structurally related compounds that bind to the AhR and exhibit biological actions similar to TCDD are commonly referred to as "dioxin-like compounds" (DLCs). Ambient human exposure to DLCs occurs through the ingestion of foods containing residues of DLCs that bioconcentrate through the food chain. Due to their lipophilicity and persistence, once internalized, they accumulate in body tissues, mainly adipose, resulting in chronic lifetime human exposure. Since human exposure to DLCs always involves a complex mixture, the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) methodology has been developed as a mathematical tool to assess the health risk posed by complex mixtures of these compounds. The TEF methodology is a relative potency scheme that ranks the dioxin-like activity of a compound relative to TCDD, which is the most potent congener. This allows for the estimation of the potential dioxin-like activity of a mixture of chemicals, based on a common mechanism of action involving an initial binding of DLCs to the AhR. The toxic equivalency of DLCs was nominated for evaluation because of the widespread human exposure to DLCs and the lack of data on the adequacy of the TEF methodology for predicting relative potency for cancer risk. To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF), and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) are not manufactured commercially other than for scientific research purposes. The main sources of TCDD and PeCDF releases into the environment are from metal smelting, refining, and processing; combustion and incineration sources; chemical manufacturing and processing; biological and photochemical processes; and existing reservior sources that reflect past releases. PCB mixtures were commercially produced and used in the electric power industry as dielectric insulating fluids in transformers and capacitors and used in hydraulic fluids, plastics, and paints. TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 were selected for study by the National Toxicology Program as part of the dioxin TEF evaluation to assess the cancer risk posed by complex mixtures of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and PCBs. The dioxin TEF evaluation includes conducting multiple 2-year rat bioassays to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLC's, structurally related PCBs, and mixtures of these compounds. Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a mixture of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 (henceforth referred to as the TEF mixture) in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 14, 31, or 53 weeks or 2 years. While one of the aims of the dioxin TEF evaluation was a comparative analysis across studies, in this Technical Report only the results of the present study of the mixture of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 are presented and discussed. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of 81 female rats were administered 10, 22, 46, or 100 ng toxic equivalents (TEQ)/kg body weight in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage, 5 days per week, for up to 105 weeks; a group of 81 vehicle control female rats received the corn oil/acetone vehicle alone. Actual doses used for each compound in the mixture were: for 10 ng TEQ/kg: 3.3 ng/kg TCDD, 6.6 ng/kg PeCDF, and 33.3 ng/kg PCB 126; for 22 ng TEQ/kg: 7.3 ng/kg TCDD, 14.5 ng/kg PeCDF, and 73.3 ng/kg PCB 126; for 46 ng TEQ/kg: 15.2 ng/kg TCDD, 30.4 ng/kg PeCDF, and 153 ng/kg PCB 126; and for 100 ng TEQ/kg: 33 ng/kg TCDD, 66 ng/kg PeCDF, and 333 ng/kg PCB 126. Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, or 53 weeks. Survival of all dosed groups of rats was similar to that of the vehicle control group. Mean body weights of the 22 and 46 ng TEQ/kg groups were less than those of the vehicle control groups after week 69 of the study. Mean body weights of the 100 ng TEQ/kg group were less than those of the vehicle control group after week 37 of the study. Thyroid Hormone Concentrations: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone concentrations were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. At 14, 31, and 53 weeks, there were dose-dependent reductions in total serum and free thyroxine concentrations. There were dose-dependent increases in serum triiodothyronine concentrations at 14 and 31 weeks. No changes in serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations were observed at any time point. Hepatic Cell Proliferation Data: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was conducted at the interim evaluations. At 14 weeks, no effects on the hepatocellular labeling index were observed in the dosed groups compared to the vehicle controls. At 31 and 53 weeks, the hepatocellular labeling index was significantly higher in the 46 and 100 ng TEQ/kg groups compared to the vehicle controls. Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Activities: To evaluate the expression of known dioxin-responsive genes, CYP1A1-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide-4-hydroxylase (A4H) activity were evaluated at the interim time points. Liver and lung EROD (CYP1A1) activities and hepatic A4H (CYP1A2) activities were significantly greater in all dosed groups than in the vehicle controls at all interim evaluations (14, 31, and 53 weeks). Determinations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 Concentrations in Tissues: Tissue concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 were analyzed in the fat, liver, lung, and blood at each interim evaluation and at the end of the 2-year study (105 weeks). The highest concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 were observed in the liver followed by fat. Liver and fat concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 at each interim evaluation and at 105 weeks were higher in groups with increasing doses of the mixture and generally increased with duration of dosing. In the lung, PeCDF was present at detectable concentrations in the 46 and 100 ng TEQ/kg groups at 14 and 31 weeks. Measurable concentrations of TCDD and PCB 126 were observed at 14 and 31 weeks in the lung of rats in all dosed groups with the highest concentrations observed in the 100 ng TEQ/kg group. At 53 weeks, concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 in the lung generally increased with increasing dose. At 105 weeks, detectable concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 in the lung were observed in all dosed groups. In blood, TCDD and PCB 126 concentrations at 14 and 31 weeks generally increased with increasing dose. Blood concentrations of PeCDF were detectable in the 46 and 100 ng TEQ/kg groups at 14 weeks and at 22 ng TEQ/kg or greater at 31 weeks. At 53 and 105 weeks, concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 in blood generally increased with increasing dose and duration of dosing. Pathology and Statistical Analyses: Relative liver weights were significantly increased in all dosed groups at 14, 31, and 53 weeks and correlated with increased incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. Increasing duration of exposure led to an increase in the spectrum, incidence, and severity of nonneoplastic effects. The only significant effect at 14 weeks was increased incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. At 53 weeks, there was a significant effect on the incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, pigmentation, focal fatty change, bile duct hyperplasia, and toxic hepatopathy. At 2 years, there were significant increases in the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and cholangiocarcinoma of the liver. There was an increase in hepatic toxicity characterized by increases in the incidences of numerous nonneoplastic lesions including hepatocyte hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, pigmentation, inflammation, diffuse fatty change, bile duct hyperplasia, oval cell hyperplasia, nodular hyperplasia, eosinophilic focus, cholangiofibrosis, bile duct cysts, necrosis, portal fibrosis, mixed cell focus, and toxic hepatopathy. In the lung, there were dose-dependent increases in the incidences of bronchiolar metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium at 53 weeks and at 2 years and squamous metaplasia at 2 years. At 2 years, there was a dose-dependent increase in the incidences of cystic keratinizing epithelioma. In the pancreas, there were increases in the incidences of numerous nonneoplastic lesions including arterial chronic active inflammation, acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization, acinar atrophy, chronic active inflammation, and duct dilatation. At 2 years, incidences of acinar adenoma or acinar carcinoma that exceeded the historical control ranges were seen in all dosed groups except the 100 ng TEQ/kg group. Treatment-related increases in the incidences of nonneoplastic lesions were seen in other organs including hyperplasia, cystic degeneration, atrophy, and cytoplasmic vacuolization of the adrenal cortex; gingival squamous hyperplasia of the oral mucosa; squamous metaplasia of the uterus; atrophy of the thymus (incidence and severity); chronic active inflammation of the ovary; nephropathy of the kidney (incidence and severity); cardiomyopathy; bone marrow hyperplasia; transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder; chronic active inflammation of the mesenteric artery; and follicular cell hypertrophy of the thyroid gland.

As mixed-sex tilapia stocks are mainly farmed in extensive systems their high fecundity and reproduction rate results in overcrowding of ponds. Therefore all-male stocks are highly desirable. Previous investigations in this species showed a strong influence of temperature on sex determination with an suspected underlying genetic basis. Thus, losses in productivity due to stunting of mixed sex Nile Tilapia stocks could be alleviated by production of temperature sensitive lines to sustainably increase the proportion of males by temperature treatment (36°C/10 days). Starting with 36 families of Oreochromis niloticus from Lake Manzala (Egypt) as base population a two generation selection experiment was conducted to develop high and low temperature sensitive lines. The percentage of males in treatment groups was the selection criteria and the families showing the largest or lowest surplus in their sex ratios were selected. The results clearly indicated that selection for sex ratio in temperature treated groups is possible. In the second generation of selection a male percentage of 89.7% was obtained in the high line. Downwards selection resulted in a decrease of the male percentage from 65.2 %.to 54% in the second generation of selection. No correlated response to selection was observed in the sex ratios of control groups. The results showed that selection for temperature dependent sex ratios is a feasible approach. Thus, it seems to be possible to increase the male proportion in Nile tilapia by means of selection for temperature dependent sex determination. © Eugen Ulmer KG.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38849159169&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=69c7918f422eef09d47b3b409bec006e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gutermann, A.</author><author>Mayer, E.</author><author>Von Dehn-Rothfelser, K.</author><author>Breidenstein, C.</author><author>Weber, M.</author><author>Muench, M.</author><author>Gungor, D.</author><author>Suehnel, J.</author><author>Moebius, U.</author><author>Lechmann, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficacy of oncolytic herpesvirus NV1020 can be enhanced by combination with chemotherapeutics in colon carcinoma cells</title><secondary-title>Human Gene Therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human Gene Therapy</full-title></periodical><pages>1241-1253</pages><volume>17</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/hum.2006.17.1241</electronic-resource-num><abstract>NV1020, an oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1, can destroy colon cancer cells by selectively replicating within these cells, while sparing normal cells. NV1020 is currently under investigation in a clinical phase I/III trial as an agent for the treatment of colon cancer liver metastases, in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), SN38 (the active metabolite of irinoiecan), and oxaliplatin. To study the synergy of NV1020 and chemotherapy, cytotoxicity and viral replication were evaluated in vitro by treating various human and murine colon carcinoma cell lines, using a colorimetric viability assay, a clonogenic assay, and a plaque-forming assay. In vivo experiments, using a subcutaneous syngeneic CT-26 tumor model in BALB/c mice, were performed to determine the efficacy of combination therapy. In vitro studies showed that the efficacy of NV1020 on human colon carcinoma cell lines HT-29, WiDr, and HCT-116 was additively or synergistically enhanced in combination with 5-FU, SN38, or oxaliplatin. The sequence of application was not important and effects were still apparent after a 21-day incubation period. Three intratumoral treatments with NV1020 (1 × 107 plaque-forming units), followed by three subcutaneous treatments with 5-FU (50 mg/kg), resulted in substantially higher inhibition of tumor growth and prolongation of survival compared with monotherapies (NV1020/5-FU vs. NV1020, p = 0.027). On WiDr cells, reduced replication of NV1020, in combination with 5-FU, indicated that additive and synergistic effects of combination therapy must be independent from viral replication. These results suggest that NV1020, in combination with chemotherapy, is a promising therapy for treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer of the liver. We hypothesize that infection of cells with NV1020 sensitizes the infected cells for the cytotoxic effect of the chemotherapeutics. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33845786476&amp;doi=10.1089%2fhum.2006.17.1241&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=54213292133c34eadafd33a2e5377767</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rekiel, A.</author><author>Wiȩcek, J.</author><author>Bielecki, W.</author><author>Czumińska, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of drying technique on select reproduction indices-</title><secondary-title>Medycyna Weterynaryjna</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medycyna Weterynaryjna</full-title></periodical><pages>92-95</pages><volume>60</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The observations were carried out on crossbred sows: Polish Landrace x Polish Large White, and were performed during six reproduction cycles with 6 weeks of lactation. Two different techniques of sow drying (traditional and experimental) were compared. The traditional technique consists in the restrictive feeding of sows just before and after weaning. The experimental technique consisted in maintaining the feeding level used before weaning throughout the weaning day and on until oestrus (although no longer than 10 days after weaning). Reproduction and mammary gland multiparous were measured. The reproduction results, mammary gland and reproductive organs indicate the usefulness of the drying technique with an intensive feeding level for sows with prolonged lactation to 42 days in six reproduction cycles.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1442288860&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d0bda59fe37bd756f20cb8c273cc0986</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, C.-l.</author><author>Federmeier, K.D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>To watch, to see, and to differ: An event-related potential study of concreteness effects as a function of word class and lexical ambiguity</title><secondary-title>Brain and Language</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain and Language</full-title></periodical><pages>145-158</pages><volume>104</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bandl.2007.06.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Electrophysiological techniques were used to assess the generalizability of concreteness effects on word processing across word class (nouns and verbs) and different types of lexical ambiguity (syntactic only and combined syntactic/semantic).

The compatibility of current addition-reaction silicone impression materials and Type IV gypsum products is not completely understood. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to compare surface detail reproduction between various combinations of contemporary addition-reaction silicone impression materials and Type IV gypsum products. Material and methods. Under standardized conditions, 300 impressions were made of a ruled stainless steel die (ADA specification 19), using 5 addition-reaction silicones (Examix-NDS, Doric-ES Flo-Light, Panasil Contact Plus, Extrude Wash, and President Plus Jet). Fifteen impressions of each material were poured with each Type IV gypsum product (Silky-Rock, Fuji Rock, Suprastone, or Vel-Mix). Using ×12 magnification, 2 independent examiners scored the reproducibility of a 20-μm line in both the impression and the resultant casts. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-way analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni testing (α=.05). Results. All impression materials tested fully reproduced the 20-μm line. Different impression materials showed different compatibility with different Type IV gypsum products. Only 25% of the Type IV gypsum casts completely reproduced the resultant 20-μm line with fine margins, and 88% of the completely reproduced casts were made from Suprastone. Conclusion. Not all combinations of impression material and Type IV gypsum products used exhibited similar compatibility.

To seek for molecular links, we employed an established cell culture model for viral replication, and assessed how the expression of an HCV subgenomic replicon affects iron metabolism in host Huh7 hepatoma cells. Methods: The expression of iron metabolism genes and parameters defining the cellular iron status were analyzed and compared between parent and replicon Huh7 cells. Results: By using the IronChip microarray platform, we observed replicon-induced changes in expression profiles of iron metabolism genes. Notably, ceruloplasmin mRNA and protein expression were decreased in replicon cells. In addition, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) was also downregulated, while ferroportin levels were elevated, resulting in reduced iron uptake and increased iron release capacity of replicon cells. These responses were associated with an iron-deficient phenotype, manifested in decreased levels of the "labile iron pool" and concomitant induction of IRE-binding activity and IRP2 expression. Furthermore, hemin-treated replicon cells exhibited a defect in retaining iron. The clearance of the replicon by prolonged treatment with interferon-α only partially reversed the iron-deficient phenotype but almost completely restored the capacity of cured cells to retain iron. Conclusions: We propose that Huh7 cells undergo genetic reprogramming to permit subgenomic viral replication that results in reduction of intracellular iron levels. This response may provide a mechanism to bypass iron-mediated inactivation of the viral RNA polymerase NS5B. © 2007 European Association for the Study of the Liver.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34249278461&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.jhep.2007.01.035&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=64325f9360acf0bc82235cf2c3d0744f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eklund, M.</author><author>Spjuth, O.</author><author>Wikberg, J.E.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The C1C2: A framework for simultaneous model selection and assessment</title><secondary-title>BMC Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-9-360</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: There has been recent concern regarding the inability of predictive modeling approaches to generalize to new data. Some of the problems can be attributed to improper methods for model selection and assessment. Here, we have addressed this issue by introducing a novel and general framework, the C1C2, for simultaneous model selection and assessment. The framework relies on a partitioning of the data in order to separate model choice from model assessment in terms of used data. Since the number of conceivable models in general is vast, it was also of interest to investigate the employment of two automatic search methods, a genetic algorithm and a brute-force method, for model choice. As a demonstration, the C1C2 was applied to simulated and real-world datasets. A penalized linear model was assumed to reasonably approximate the true relation between the dependent and independent variables, thus reducing the model choice problem to a matter of variable selection and choice of penalizing parameter. We also studied the impact of assuming prior knowledge about the number of relevant variables on model choice and generalization error estimates. The results obtained with the C1C2 were compared to those obtained by employing repeated K-fold cross-validation for choosing and assessing a model. Results: The C1C2 framework performed well at finding the true model in terms of choosing the correct variable subset and producing reasonable choices for the penalizing parameter, even in situations when the independent variables were highly correlated and when the number of observations was less than the number of variables. The C1C2 framework was also found to give accurate estimates of the generalization error. Prior information about the number of important independent variables improved the variable subset choice but reduced the accuracy of generalization error estimates. Using the genetic algorithm worsened the model choice but not the generalization error estimates, compared to using the brute-force method. The results obtained with repeated K-fold cross-validation were similar to those produced by the C1C2 in terms of model choice, however a lower accuracy of the generalization error estimates was observed. Conclusion: The C1C2 framework was demonstratedto work well for finding the true model within a penalized linear model class and accurately assess its generalization error, even for datasets with many highly correlated independent variables, a low observation-to-variable ratio, and model assumption deviations. A complete separation of the model choice and the model assessment in terms of data used for each task improves the estimates of the generalization error. © 2008 Eklund et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-52949118135&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1471-2105-9-360&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=203d738555a0df10aee8f0e88f48887c</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, J.</author><author>Eshaghi, M.</author><author>Liu, J.</author><author>Murthy Karuturi, R.K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Near-sigmoid modeling to simultaneously profile genome-wide DNA replication timing and efficiency in single DNA replication microarray studies</title><secondary-title>Series on Advances in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</secondary-title></titles><pages>383-392</pages><volume>6</volume><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>DNA replication is a key process in cell division cycle. It is initiated in coordinated manner in several species. To understand the DNA replication in a species one needs to measure the half replication timing (or replication timing) and the efficiency of replication which vary across genome in higher eukaryotes. In the previous studies, no direct assessment of replication efficiency on a genomic scale was performed while the replication timing was indirectly assessed using average DNA. In this paper, we present a first-ever-method of directly measuring both half replication timing and efficiency simultaneously from a single DNA microarray time-course data. We achieve it by fitting the so called near-sigmoid model to each locus of the DNA. We use this model apply S. pombe DNA replication microarray data and show that it is effective for genome-scale replication timing and efficiency profiling studies.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863166400&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c8fb551284e0e2ecd6d1cf9f1117eca7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watanabe, Y.</author><author>Shibata, K.</author><author>Ikemura, T.</author><author>Maekawa, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication timing of extremely large genes on human chromosomes 11q and 21q</title><secondary-title>Gene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gene</full-title></periodical><pages>74-80</pages><volume>421</volume><number>1-2</number><issue>1-2</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.gene.2008.06.016</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many human genes have been mapped precisely in the genome. These genes vary from a few kb to more than 1 Mb in length. Previously, we measured replication timing along the entire lengths of human chromosomes 11q and 21q at the sequence level. In the present study, we used the newest information for human chromosomes 11q and 21q to analyze the replication timing of 30 extremely large genes (&gt; 250 kb) in two human cell lines (THP-1 and Jurkat). The timing of replication differed between the 5′- and 3′-ends of each of extremely large genes on 11q and 21q, and the time interval between their replication varied among genes of different lengths. The large genes analyzed here included several tissue-specific genes associated with neural diseases and genes encoding cell adhesion molecules: some of these genes had different patterns of replication timing between the two cell lines. The amyloid precursor protein gene (APP), which is associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD1), showed the largest difference in timing of replication between its 5′- and 3′-ends in relation to gene length of all the large genes studied on 11q and 21q. These extremely large genes were concentrated in and around genomic regions in which replication timing switches from early to late on both 11q and 21q. The differences of replication timing between the 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of large genes may be related to the molecular mechanisms that underlie tissue-specific expression. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies in mice have characterized a carcinogenicity mode of action that involved depletion of plasma cholesterol, cell death, both as single cell necrosis and as apoptosis, and sustained increases in cell replication rates. In a study reported in this article, female rats have been exposed to thiamethoxam in their diet at concentrations of 0, 1000, and 3000 ppm for 50 weeks, a study design directly comparable to the mouse study in which the mode of action changes were characterized. In rats, thiamethoxam had no adverse effects on either the biochemistry or histopathology of the liver at any time point during the study. Cell replication rates were not increased, in fact they were significantly decreased at several time points. The lack of effect on the rat liver is entirely consistent with the lack of liver tumor formation in the two-year cancer bioassay. Comparisons of the metabolism of thiamethoxam in rats and mice have shown that concentrations of the parent chemical were either similar or higher in rat blood than in mouse blood in both single dose and the dietary studies strongly indicating that thiamethoxam itself is unlikely to play a role in the development of liver tumors. In contrast, the concentrations of the two metabolites, CGA265307 and CGA330050, shown to play a role in the development of liver damage in the mouse, were 140- (CGA265307) and 15- (CGA330050) fold lower in rats than in mice following either a single oral dose, or dietary administration of thiamethoxam for up to 50 weeks. Comparisons of the major metabolic pathways of thiamethoxam in vitro using mouse, rat, and human liver fractions have shown that metabolic rates in humans are lower than those in the rat suggesting that thiamethoxam is unlikely to pose a hazard to humans exposed to this chemical at the low concentrations found in the environment or during its use as an insecticide. © The Author 2005.

This study tested whether vital rates were differentially affected by biotic interactions and water availability. • The effects of manipulations of above-ground competition (through clipping) and water availability (through water addition) on the vital rates of seedlings of three species (Viola elatior Fries, Viola pumila Chaix and Viola stagnina Kit.) were analysed in dry, mesic and wet grasslands. • Water addition and grassland type had the largest effects on survival (accounting for 41 and 24% of total variation, respectively) across species. Height growth rate was positively affected by grassland type (19%) and water addition (12%) and varied among species (8%), while leaf accumulation rates and reproduction were affected by grassland type and clipping. The data suggested facilitative effects of the canopy on seedling survival in the dry grassland. • This study presents evidence that environmental conditions and biotic interactions may have differential effects on seedling survival, growth and reproduction. The findings highlight the complex interplay between spatial and temporal environmental variation and biotic interactions in structuring plant communities. © New Phytologist (2005).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-17644413255&amp;doi=10.1111%2fj.1469-8137.2005.01336.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8197cd112805a21c076b8fccab921a60</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>GuhaMajumdar, M.</author><author>Dawson-Baglien, E.</author><author>Sears, B.B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Creation of a chloroplast microsatellite reporter for detection of replication slippage in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title><secondary-title>Eukaryotic Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eukaryotic Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>639-646</pages><volume>7</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/EC.00447-07</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Microsatellites are composed of short tandem direct repeats; deletions or duplications of those repeats through the process of replication slippage result in microsatellite instability relative to other genomic loci. Variation in repeat number occurs so frequently that microsatellites can be used for genotyping and forensic analysis. However, an accurate assessment of the rates of change can be difficult because the presence of many repeats makes it difficult to determine whether changes have occurred through single or multiple events. The current study was undertaken to experimentally assess the rates of replication slippage that occur in vivo in the chloroplast DNA of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. A reporter construct was created in which a stretch of AAAG repeats was inserted into a functional gene to allow changes to be observed when they occurred at the synthetic microsatellite. Restoration of the reading frame occurred through replication slippage in 15 of every million viable cells. Since only one-third of the potential insertion/deletion events would restore the reading frame, the frequency of change could be deduced to be 4.5 × 10-5. Analysis of the slippage events showed that template slippage was the primary event, resulting in deletions rather than duplications. These findings contrasted with events observed in Escherichia coli during maintenance of the plasmid, where duplications were the rule. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology.

We used a repeated measures design with 14 healthy volunteers. Measures of velocity replication were performed in two ranges of knee joint flexion (0°-30° and 60°-90°), across four testing velocities (5, 10, 15, and 30°/s) in two movement directions (flexion and extension). Statistical analysis included intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs; 2, k) and associated standard error of the measures calculated between day 1 and 2. We performed z-tests between all possible combinations of ICC pairs using Fisher's Z transformations to determine if any significant differences existed between observed ICCs. We also calculated correlation ratios (η2) to explain the source of variability in the calculated ICCs. To assess measurement accuracy, we calculated constant error and absolute error between criterion and replication velocities. Results on ICCs and standard error of the measurements (SEMs) ranged from r = -0.44±7.00 to 0.88±0.72°/s. Calculated z-tests indicated six paired ICCs were significantly different (p &lt; 0.1). In all six pairs, the faster test velocity had a lower ICC magnitude. The η2 calculations demonstrated that inconsistent performance between day 1 and 2 caused the low ICC magnitudes observed with faster testing velocities. Significantly more absolute error occurred at 30 and 15°/s compared with 5°/s. Significantly less constant error was observed for 30°/s compared with 15°/s. A significant direction by range of motion interaction indicated less constant error for flexion movements in the 60°-90° range of motion (ROM) as compared with extension movements in either ROM. Healthy individuals could actively replicate slower criterion velocities in the mid and end ranges of knee joint motion in both movement directions with an acceptable amount of consistency and accuracy. The data support the use of velocity replication in future investigations on proprioceptive function.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0347511022&amp;doi=10.1080%2f08990220310001623004&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2e2dfa50801e96009ce242920a7d7dfe</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mann, C.R.</author><author>Baldwin, R.O.</author><author>Kharoufeh, J.P.</author><author>Mullins, B.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A queueing approach to optimal resource replication in wireless sensor networks</title><secondary-title>Performance Evaluation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Performance Evaluation</full-title></periodical><pages>689-700</pages><volume>65</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.peva.2008.03.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We develop a queueing model for analyzing resource replication strategies in wireless sensor networks.

Results showed that both sulfide and water hardness protected against lethal acute and chronic silver toxicity in terms of mortality. However, only sulfide showed a protective effect against the sub-lethal chronic silver effects on growth and reproduction. These findings suggest that both reactive sulfide and water hardness must be taken into account in the development of a chronic version of the Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) for waterborne silver. Furthermore, acute-to-chronic ratio values for silver toxicity showed that only small increases in toxicity are seen over the chronic exposure relative to the acute toxicity. Mortality is the most sensitive endpoint in moderately hard water and in the presence of sulfide. Reproduction, measured as the number of neonates produced per adult per reproduction day, is the most sensitive one in hard water in the absence of sulfide. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Subjects who adapt to laterally deviating prism lenses during walking show a broad generalization to an arm pointing task, while subjects who adapt to prisms during arm pointing do not show generalization to walking. It is not known whether this broad generalization persists with other movements outside of walking or what specific features of the walking task, e.g. lower extremity involvement, allow it to be so broadly generalizable. In the current study, we tested healthy adult subjects performing one of three forms of prism adaptation and subsequently measured generalization. In Experiment 1 we tested whether a seated arm pointing prism adaptation would generalize to the leg. In Experiment 2 we tested whether a seated leg pointing prism adaptation would generalize to the arm. In Experiment 3 we tested whether standing influenced the extent of generalization from leg to arm. Results were surprising. We found a clear and consistent generalization from arm to leg, but much less so from leg to arm during either the seated or the standing task. These findings indicate that prism adaptations during arm movements are not limb-specific, as has been previously suggested. Further, the lack of generalization from leg to arm suggests that neither the adaptation of leg movements specifically, nor standing posture, nor the bilateral component of walking could be the salient feature allowing for its broad generalization across body parts. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-40149094500&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00221-007-1220-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ba35731280a3987b711fff7e98282a0b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yi, T.</author><author>Leung, K.S.-Y.</author><author>Lu, G.-H.</author><author>Zhang, H.</author><author>Chan, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification and comparative determination of senkyunolide A in traditional Chinese medicinal plants Ligusticum chuanxiong and Angelica sinensis by HPLC coupled with DAD and ESI-MS</title><secondary-title>Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin</full-title></periodical><pages>1480-1483</pages><volume>53</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1248/cpb.53.1480</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Using the HPLC/DAD/ESI/MS method, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of senkyunolide A (SA) in the rhizomes of Ligusticum chuanxiong (Rhizoma chuanxiong; CX) and roots of Angelica sinensis (DG) was established. As a result, it was found that SA is a characteristic standard compound for the quality evaluation and chemical differentiation between CX and DG. Methanol was chosen in the preparation of standard solutions and extraction of samples based on the stability data. The identity of SA in CX and DG was unambiguously determined based on the quasimolecular ions in ESI-MS. A comprehensive validation of the method, including sensitivity, linearity, reproducibility and recovery, was conducted using the optimized chromatographic conditions. The linear calibration curve was acquired with R2&gt;0.999 and limit of detection (S/N=3) was estimated to be 12.5 μg/g. The reproducibility was evaluated by repeated sample injection and replicated analysis of samples with the relative standard deviation (RSD) value found within 0.68%. The recovery rates of SA varied within the range of 96.91 - 101.50% with RSD less than 2.38%. In the present work, the contents of SA were quantified within 3.94 - 9.14 mg/g and 0.108 - 0.588 mg/g for 12 batches each of CX and DG. The results demonstrated that SA is a useful standard compound for the quality evaluation and chemical differentiation between CX and DG. The analytical procedure is precise and reproducible and thus suitable for the analysis of a large number of samples. © 2005 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-27744542156&amp;doi=10.1248%2fcpb.53.1480&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=06fcccb5ad3f877f41a8aeb20d07f60d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sahli, H.F.</author><author>Conner, J.K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterizing ecological generalization in plant-pollination systems</title><secondary-title>Oecologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oecologia</full-title></periodical><pages>365-372</pages><volume>148</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00442-006-0396-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Despite the development of diversity indices in community ecology that incorporate both richness and evenness, pollination biologists commonly use only pollinator richness to estimate generalization. Similarly, while pollination biologists have stressed the utility of pollinator importance, incorporating both pollinator abundance and effectiveness, importance values have not been included in estimates of generalization in pollination systems. In this study, we estimated pollinator generalization for 17 plant species using Simpson's diversity index, which includes richness and evenness. We compared these estimates with estimates based on only pollinator richness, and compared diversity estimates calculated using importance data with those using only visitation data. We found that pollinator richness explains only 57-65% of the variation in diversity, and that, for most plant species, pollinator importance was determined primarily by differences in visitation rather than by differences in effectiveness. While simple richness may suffice for broad comparisons of pollinator generalization, measures that incorporate evenness will provide a much more accurate understanding of generalization. Although incorporating labor-intensive measurements of pollinator effectiveness are less necessary for broad surveys, effectiveness estimates will be important for detailed studies of some plant species. Unfortunately, at this point it is impossible to predict a priori which species these are. © Springer-Verlag 2006.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33744467092&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00442-006-0396-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a6f910abb296fa111694609120226911</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anderson, D.H.</author><author>Lignugaris/Kraft, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Video-Case Instruction for Teachers of Students with Problem Behaviors in General and Special Education Classrooms</title><secondary-title>Journal of Special Education Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Special Education Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>31-45</pages><volume>21</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/016264340602100203</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study examined the effects of a video-case presentation on the behavior analytic skills of 45 preservice elementary teachers.

Structurally related compounds that bind to the AhR and exhibit biological actions similar to TCDD are commonly referred to as "dioxin-like compounds" (DLCs). Ambient human exposure to DLCs occurs through the ingestion of foods containing residues of DLCs that bioconcentrate through the food chain. Due to their lipophilicity and persistence, once internalized they accumulate in adipose tissue resulting in chronic lifetime human exposure. Since human exposure to DLCs always occurs as a complex mixture, the Toxic Equivalency Factor (TEF) methodology has been developed as a mathematical tool to assess the health risk posed by complex mixtures of these compounds. The TEF methodology is a relative potency scheme that ranks the dioxin-like activity of a compound relative to TCDD that is the most potent congener. This allows for the estimation of the potential dioxin-like activity of a mixture of chemicals, based on a common mechanism of action involving an initial binding of DLCs to the AhR. The toxic equivalency of DLCs was nominated for evaluation, because of the widespread human exposure to DLCs and the lack of data on the adequacy of the TEF methodology for predicting relative potency for cancer risk. To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally-related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. 3,3',4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) was produced commercially before 1977 for the electric industry as a dielectric insulating fluid for transformers and capacitors. Manufacture and use of the chemical was stopped because of increased PCB residues in the environment, but it continues to be released into the environment through the use and disposal of products containing PCBs, as by-products during the manufacture of certain organic chemicals, and during combustion of some waste materials. Bioaccumulation of PCB 126 results in persistent levels in animal and human tissues and the biological responses to PCB 126 are similar to those of TCDD, a known human carcinogen. PCB 126 was selected for study by the National Toxicology Program as a part of the dioxin TEF evaluation to assess the cancer risk posed by complex mixtures of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and PCBs. The dioxin TEF evaluation includes conducting multiple 2-year rat bioassays to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs, structurally related PCBs, and mixtures of these compounds. PCB 126 was included since this is the most potent coplanar PCB that has dioxin-like activities. While one of the aims of the dioxin TEF evaluation was a comparative analysis across studies, in this Technical Report only the results of the PCB 126 study are presented and discussed. Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were administered PCB 126 (99% pure) in corn oil with acetone by gavage for 14, 31, or 53 weeks or 2 years. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of 81 female rats were administered 30, 100, 175, 300, 550, or 1,000 ng PCB 126/kg body weight in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage, 5 days per week, for up to 104 weeks; a group of 81 vehicle control female rats received the corn oil/acetone vehicle alone. A group of 28 rats received 10 ng/kg for up to 53 weeks only. Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, or 53 weeks. A stop-exposure group of 50 female rats was administered 1,000 ng/kg PCB 126 in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 30 weeks then the vehicle for the remainder of the study. Mean body weights of 30 and 100 ng/kg rats were similar to those of the vehicle controls during most of the study, mean body weights of 175 and 300 ng/kg rats were less than those of the vehicle controls during year 2 of the study, and mean body weights of 550 ng/kg, 1,000 ng/kg core study, and 1,000 ng/kg stop-exposure rats were less than those of the vehicle controls after week 17. THYROID HORMONE CONCENTRATIONS: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels were evaluated at the 14-, 31- and 53- week interim evaluations. In the 550 and 1,000 ng/kg rats, total thyroxine (T4) and free T4 were significantly lower than vehicle controls and serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were significantly higher than vehicle controls at the 14-week interim evaluation. Serum T3 was also significantly higher in the 300 ng/kg rats compared to vehicle controls at 14 weeks. At 31 weeks, T3 was significantly higher at doses of 100 ng/kg or greater compared to vehicle controls. TSH levels were higher in 550 and 1,000 ng/kg rats than in vehicle controls. At 53 weeks, significantly lower serum concentrations of total T4 and free T4 were observed compared to vehicle controls in groups administered 175 ng/kg or greater and 30 ng/kg or greater, respectively. Serum T3 levels were significantly higher at doses of 175 ng/kg or greater compared to vehicle controls. No changes in TSH were observed between vehicle controls and dosed rats at 53 weeks. HEPATIC CELL PROLIFERATION DATA: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was conducted at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. The hepatocellular labeling index was significantly higher at doses of 300 ng/kg or greater at 14 weeks and 175 ng/kg or greater at 31 weeks compared to vehicle controls. No statistically significant differences were observed between vehicle controls and PCB 126 dosed rats at 53 weeks. However at 53 weeks, a 5.8-fold increase above the vehicle controls was observed in the 1,000 ng/kg group. CYTOCHROME P450 ENZYME ACTIVITIES: To evaluate the expression of known dioxin-responsive genes, CYP1A1 associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide 4-hydroxylase (A-4-H) activity were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. In addition, CYP2B associated pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (PROD) activity was also analysed. Hepatic PROD (CYP2B1) and hepatic and pulmonary EROD (CYP1A1) activity were significantly greater in all dosed groups than in vehicle controls at weeks 14, 31, and 53. Hepatic A-4-H (CYP1A2) activity was significantly greater in the 30, 100, 175, 300, 550, and 1,000 ng/kg groups compared to vehicle controls at weeks 14, 31, and 53. DETERMINATIONS of PCB 126 CONCENTRATIONS IN TISSUES: The tissue disposition of PCB 126 was analyzed in the liver, lung, fat, and blood of all rats in vehicle controls and all dosed groups at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations and in 10 rats per group including vehicle controls at the end of the 2-year study (104 weeks). Detectable concentrations of PCB 126 were observed in the liver, fat, lung, and blood. Measurable concentrations of PCB 126 were present in the liver and fat at weeks 31, 53, and 104. Hepatic and fat concentrations increased with increasing doses of PCB 126. Measurable concentrations of PCB 126 were present in vehicle control lung tissue at 53 and 104 weeks. No PCB 126 was observed in the blood from the vehicle control rats. Lung and blood concentrations tended to increase with increasing doses of PCB 126, with a few exceptions. In the stop-exposure group, PCB 126 concentrations in liver and fat were lower than the levels observed in the 30 ng/kg group. In the stop-exposure group, lung tissue PCB 126 concentrations were equivalent to the levels observed in the 30 ng/kg group. In blood from the stop-exposure group, PCB 126 concentrations were equivalent to the levels observed in the 100 ng/kg group. PATHOLOGY AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Absolute and relative liver weights were significantly increased at all time points and correlated with increased incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. At 2 years, there were significant treatment-related increases in the incidences of cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular adenoma. Three hepatocholangiomas were seen in the 1,000 ng/kg core study group and a single incidence of cholangioma each occurred in the 550 and 1,000 ng/kg core study groups. At 2 years, a significant dose-related increase in hepatic toxicity was observed and was characterized by increased incidences of numerous lesions including hepatocyte hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, diffuse fatty change, bile duct hyperplasia, bile duct cyst, oval cell hyperplasia, necrosis, pigmentation, inflammation, nodular hyperplasia, portal fibrosis, cholangiofibrosis, and toxic hepatopathy. The incidences of these lesions were generally decreased in the 1,000 ng/kg stop-exposure group compared to the 1,000 ng/kg core study group. The lung weights of 1,000 ng/kg rats were generally significantly increased at weeks 14, 31, and 53. At 2 years, treatment related increases in the incidences of cystic keratinizing epithelioma and squamous cell carcinomas were observed. In addition, dose-related increases in the incidences of bronchiolar metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium and squamous metaplasia were also observed. The incidence of gingival squamous cell carcinoma of the oral mucosa was significantly increased in the 1,000 ng/kg core study group at 2 years. Gingival squamous cell carcinoma, although reduced in incidence as compared to the 1,000 ng/kg core study group, was still present in the 1,000 ng/kg stop-exposure group. At 2 years, adenomas and/or carcinomas were present in the adrenal cortex of most core study groups and in the 1,000 ng/kg stop-exposure group. Dose-related effects on the incidences of adrenal cortex atrophy and cytoplasmic vacuolization were also seen.

Analyzing ratings outcomes of 7, 355 small-ensemble and solo events from two consecutive midwestern state festivals (2001 and 2002), Bergee and Platt found statistically significant differences in the main effects of time of day, type of event (solo/ensemble), and school size. In the replication phase of the present study, we used their procedures to analyze data from the 2003 festival (N = 3, 853), finding significant differences in the same three main effects and also performing medium (vocal/instrumental). In both studies, the type of event by performing medium interaction was significant. The extension phase consisted of applying logistic regression techniques to the fitting of a theoretical model of prediction. Two variables were added to the original four-geographical location and district level of expenditure per average daily attendance. All main effects except geographical location (eliminated owing to high collinearity), plus the type of event by performing medium interaction, emerged as strong predictors of ratings outcomes. Afternoon scheduling, entering from a large, relatively high-expenditure school, and performing as a vocalist and a soloist significantly predicted the highest rating. © 2005 by MENC: The National Association for Music Education.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-60949949260&amp;doi=10.1177%2f002242940505300207&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e1fe119d7910405b2be2e84b56b781d3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dewhirst, M.</author><author>Conetta, R.</author><author>Rumsey, F.</author><author>Jackson, P.</author><author>Zielinski, S.</author><author>George, S.</author><author>Bech, S.</author><author>Meares, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>QESTRAL (Part 4): Test signals, combining metrics and the prediction of overall spatial quality</title><secondary-title>Audio Engineering Society - 125th Audio Engineering Society Convention 2008</secondary-title></titles><pages>1085-1092</pages><volume>2</volume><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The QESTRAL project has developed an artificial listener that compares the perceived quality of a spatial audio reproduction to a reference reproduction. Test signals designed to identify distortions in both the foreground and background audio streams are created for both the reference and the impaired reproduction systems. Metrics are calculated from these test signals and are then combined using a regression model to give a measure of the overall perceived spatial quality of the impaired reproduction compared to the reference reproduction. The results of the model are shown to match closely the results obtained in listening tests. Consequently, the model can be used as an alternative to listening tests when evaluating the perceived spatial quality of a given reproduction system, thus saving time and expense.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866478452&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=96956b2e9769815fd7f553189d6e0c5f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jenke, A.C.W.</author><author>Wilhelm, A.D.</author><author>Orth, V.</author><author>Lipps, H.J.</author><author>Protzer, U.</author><author>Wirth, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term suppression of hepatitis B virus replication by short hairpin RNA expression using the scaffold/matrix attachment region-based replicating vector system pEPI-1</title><secondary-title>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</full-title></periodical><pages>2355-2359</pages><volume>52</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/AAC.00067-08</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Since the emergence of viral resistance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) during treatment is becoming an important issue even with newer drugs, there is a need for alternative treatment options such as, for example, RNA interference (RNAi) technology. While short-term suppression of HBV replication is easily achieved with small interfering RNA oligonucleotides, this is not the case for long-term suppression due to the lack of an optimal vector system. Based on the nonviral scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR)-based vector system pEPI-1, which is free of common side effects and is stably retained as an episome even in the absence of selection, we designed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vector called pEPI-RNAi for HBV suppression. HBV-replicating HepG2.2.15 cells were transfected with pEPI-RNAi, and the intracellular status of the plasmid was followed by PCR and Southern analysis. HBV replication was measured on the DNA, RNA, and protein level. HBV RNA expression was reduced by almost 85% 3 months posttransfection with pEPI-RNAi. At 8 months posttransfection in the absence of antibiotic selection pressure, the suppression level was still 70% and the vector was retained as an episome. The reduction of total intracellular HBV DNA at this point was 77%, showing a marked suppression of HBV DNA replication. At a comparable level, secretion of viral antigens, as well as progeny HBV virions, was inhibited. The S/MAR-based vector system pEPI-1 allows long-term suppression of HBV replication by the expression of suitable shRNAs. Due to its unique properties compared to commonly used vectors, it provides an interesting option for the treatment of chronically HBV-infected individuals.

Most investigators have focused on color as a signal of individual quality. An alternative, but not exclusive, function of bare part color may be signaling readiness to breed, especially in colonial, asynchronous breeders. White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) are colonial waterbirds that show vivid bare part colors on their bills and legs during reproduction. We quantified bill and leg colors to describe color changes and their possible relationship to reproductive status during the breeding season of White Ibises in the Florida Everglades from 1998 to 2001. We also examined the correlation between bare part colors and circulating concentrations of sex steroids to understand the factors that regulate bare part colors. During the display stage, male and female ibises developed dark pink bills and scarlet legs. As the breeding season progressed, bills and legs faded and developed a muted pink hue. The bare part colors of female ibises were correlated with testosterone concentrations, but those of male ibises were not correlated with any hormones. A discriminant function analysis based on principal component scores (representing variation in saturation and hue) and the amount of black on the bill successfully classified ibis reproductive stage 94% of the time. The use of bare part colors to determine reproductive status may be useful for studying reproduction in colonially nesting birds, where access to breeding sites can be difficult and potential for researcher disturbance is high. ©2006 Association of Field Ornithologists.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33646554198&amp;doi=10.1111%2fj.1557-9263.2006.00034.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e359778148439afec7cdfb67b7951ce7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iki, S.</author><author>Yokota, S.-I.</author><author>Okabayashi, T.</author><author>Yokosawa, N.</author><author>Nagata, K.</author><author>Fujii, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serum-dependent expression of promyelocytic leukemia protein suppresses propagation of influenza virus</title><secondary-title>Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>106-115</pages><volume>343</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.virol.2005.08.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The rate of propagation of influenza virus in human adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells was found to negatively correlate with the concentration of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the culture medium. Virus replicated more rapidly at lower FBS concentrations (0 or 2%) than at higher concentrations (10 or 20%) during an early stage of infection. Basal and interferon (IFN)-induced levels of typical IFN-inducible anti-viral proteins, such as 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase, dsRNA-activated protein kinase and MxA, were unaffected by variation in FBS concentrations. But promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) was expressed in a serum-dependent manner. In particular, the 65 to 70 kDa isoform of PML was markedly upregulated following the addition of serum. In contrast, other isoforms were induced by IFN treatment, and weakly induced by FBS concentrations. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that PML was mainly formed nuclear bodies in Caco-2 cells at various FBS concentrations, and the levels of the PML-nuclear bodies were upregulated by FBS. Overexpression of PML isoform consisting of 560 or 633 amino acid residues by transfection of expression plasmid results in significantly delayed viral replication rate in Caco-2 cells. On the other hand, downregulation of PML expression by RNAi enhanced viral replication. These results indicate that PML isoforms which are expressed in a serum-dependent manner suppress the propagation of influenza virus at an early stage of infection. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Sprague-Dawley rats (30/sex/group) were exposed by whole-body vapor inhalation to a target concentration of 30, 70, or 160 ppm D5 or filtered air for 6 h/day. Exposures for the F0 and F1 generations started at least 70 days prior to mating and lasted through weaning of the respective pups on postnatal day (PND) 21. Female exposures were interrupted from gestation day (GD) 21 through PND 4 to allow for parturition and to permit continuous maternal care for the early neonates. F2 pups were not directly exposed to D5. There were no exposure-related mortalities, clinical signs of toxicity, or effects on body weight or food consumption. There were no treatment-related gross findings or organ weight effects at the F0 and F1 necropsies. Other than minimal alveolar histiocytosis in all exposed groups, there were no noteworthy microscopic findings. Reproductive parameters (number of days between pairing and mating, mating and fertility indices, gestation length, and parturition), spermatogenic parameters and ovarian primordial follicle counts and numbers of corpora lutea in the F0 and F1 parental animals were not significantly changed between treated and control groups. Mean live litter sizes, number of pups born, sex ratios, pup body weights, postnatal pup survival and general physical condition of offspring in each generation were not affected. The slight, but statistically significant, increase in the mean F1 male pup AGD in the 160 ppm group was not considered to be related to treatment. Vaginal patency and balanopreputial separation were unchanged compared to controls. Thus, the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for parental and reproductive toxicity was determined to be 160 ppm D5. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We studied a population of Andrena agilissima (Hymenoptera: Andrenidae) in Italy, weighing provisioning females, load being carried and pollen provisions. We found no correlation between adult body size and loading capacity. Weight of pollen collected per trip did not vary across the day, while weight of nectar collected increased in the afternoon. The amount of nectar being carried was independent of the amount of pollen. The A. agilissima rate of reproduction resulted in less than 1 provision mass produced per day (3.6 offspring/female per season). This result is consistent with observations in other Andrena species which suggests a phylogenetic constraint in the rate of reproduction that merits further study. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/ EDP Sciences, 2005.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-23744454035&amp;doi=10.1051%2fapido%3a2005028&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d1f63652ca2c4925dd07f38343ca4490</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hulette, A.C.</author><author>Fisher, P.A.</author><author>Kim, H.K.</author><author>Ganger, W.</author><author>Landsverk, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dissociation in foster preschoolers: A replication and assessment study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Trauma and Dissociation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Trauma and Dissociation</full-title></periodical><pages>173-190</pages><volume>9</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/15299730802045914</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study replicated the Child Behavior Checklist factor structure of traumatic sequelae in maltreated children that was established by A. C. Hulette and colleagues (in press; see also A. Cholankeril et al., 2007). The factors represent dissociation and posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. The present study also examined the extent to which these 2 factor scores varied depending on specific maltreatment experiences. Results indicated that children who experienced both physical and sexual abuse in addition to neglect had significantly higher levels of dissociation than children who experienced (a) sexual abuse alone or with neglect, (b) physical abuse alone or with neglect, or (c) only neglect. The current study provides evidence that children who experience multiple forms of maltreatment are more likely to be dissociative, perhaps due to a greater need for a coping mechanism to manage the distress of that maltreatment. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

Encoded by the next-to-last gene of RSV, the M2-2 open reading frame (ORF) overlaps with the upstream M2-1 ORF, suggesting that the production of the M2-2 protein might be tightly regulated during virus replication. To evaluate the effect of M2-2 overexpression on RSV replication, the M2-2 gene was separated from M2-1 by leaving it at the position prior to the M2-1 or moving it to the promoter proximal position as an independent transcriptional unit in the RSV A2 genome. Although recombinant viruses bearing the shuffled M2-2 gene were recovered and expressed higher levels of M2-2, most of these viruses grew poorly in HEp-2 cells. Sequence analysis revealed that various mutations (substitution, insertion, and deletion) occurred in the M2-2 gene, resulting in reduced M2-2 activity as measured by the RSV minigenome system. Further examination of the M2-2 sequence and its function showed that either one of the first two AUG codons located at the 5′ end of M2-2 could be used to produce a functional M2-2 protein and that deletion of the first six amino acids from its N terminus or four amino acids from its C terminus greatly reduced its function. The effect of M2-2 protein on RSV replication was also studied by examining RSV replication in cells transiently expressing M2-2. The M2-2 protein expressed at a high level completely inhibited RSV replication. These results strongly suggested that the level of the M2-2 protein produced in the infected cells is critical to RSV replication. Copyright © 2005, American Society for Microbiology.

This letter follows the same spirit, as we will stabilize the unbiased generalization error estimates by regularization and finally obtain more robust model selection criteria for learning. We trade a small bias against a larger variance reduction, which has the beneficial effect of being more precise on a single training set. We focus on the subspace information criterion (SIC), which is an unbiased estimator of the expected generalization error measured by the reproducing kernel Hubert space norm. SIC can be applied to the kernel regression, and it was shown in earlier experiments that a small regularization of SIC has a stabilization effect. However, it remained open how to appropriately determine the degree of regularization in SIC. In this article, we derive an unbiased estimator of the expected squared error, between SIC and the expected generalization error and propose determining the degree of regularization of SIC such that the estimator of the expected squared error is minimized. Computer simulations with artificial and real data sets illustrate that the proposed method works effectively for improving the precision of SIC, especially in the high-noise-level cases. We furthermore compare the proposed method to the original SIC, the cross-validation, and an empirical Bayesian method in ridge parameter selection, with good results.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1842733198&amp;doi=10.1162%2f089976604773135113&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fb87e5a4d39c16346cd7ee31f1e346a1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, S.</author><author>Opriessnig, T.</author><author>Kitikoon, P.</author><author>Nilubol, D.</author><author>Halbur, P.G.</author><author>Thacker, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) distribution and replication in tissues and immune cells in early infected pigs</title><secondary-title>Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology</full-title></periodical><pages>261-272</pages><volume>115</volume><number>3-4</number><issue>3-4</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.11.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Replication of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in pigs, as measured by spliced capsid mRNA (Cap mRNA) and viral DNA, was investigated following experimental infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and tissue from bronchial lymph nodes (BLN), inguinal lymph nodes (ILN), tonsils, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen and thymus from infected pigs on different days post-infection (DPI) were assessed. PCV2 replication differed dramatically between tissues from the same infected pig. The virus actively replicated in most tested tissues at 14 DPI in association with increased PCV2 associated lesions and PCV2 antigen levels, although no clinical signs correlated with PCV2 associated disease were observed in infected pigs during the course of the study. The PCV2 Cap mRNA was detected only at 13 DPI in PBMCs from infected pigs, suggesting replication of the virus in circulating blood is transient and not a major site for PCV2 replication in vivo. Evaluation of the Cap mRNA and viral DNA synthesis in T and B lymphocyte and monocyte populations from PBMCs and BLN at various intervals post-inoculation revealed replication of PCV2 in all cell subpopulations; however, viral replication in B lymphocytes was greater than observed in mononuclear cells isolated from BLN at 14 DPI indicating that B lymphocytes may be an important cell population for PCV2 replication. These findings further our understanding of the cell types permissive for PCV2 replication and the pathogenesis of PCV2 infection in vivo. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

With new developments in printers, inks, and media, an inkjet printer can be treated as a digital proofer for gravure printing, providing significant time and cost savings compared to conventional procedures for job approvals. The implementation of digital proofing is integrally related to color management. In the digital proofing process, a third-party RIP can be employed to interpret raster and vector data files for a specific printer, distributing the right amount of ink on the substrate, therefore, providing better control for accurate digital color reproduction. The objective of this work was to establish a digital proofing system for gravure spot-color printing. An Epson Stylus Pro 4000 digital printer combined with two commercially available RIPs (CGS ORIS RIP and GMG ColorProof RIP) were tested and compared. ICC profiles were generated for the Epson Stylus Pro 4000 using the actual production printing substrate. The quality of spot-color reproduction was evaluated in terms of the ΔE in L*a*b* color space for selected spot colors. The overall results suggested that the shadow area of each spot-color test chart has relatively high ΔE values due to some spot colors in the test charts being out of the color gamut of the test printer. Overall, the printer with RIP software offers better spot-color reproduction resulting in lower ΔE values than printing without RIP. The Epson 4000 printer with the CGS RIP delivered better color reproduction in Yellow spot colors, while the Epson 4000 printer with the GMG RIP had better color reproduction in Blue-347, Black-392, and Red-314 spot colors. Among the seven selected spot colors, Yellow-385 is the hardest one to reproduce.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33845711981&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e1eb98306d40ed67e5129f6bf13e2b80</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wasser, S.K.</author><author>Hunt, K.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Noninvasive measures of reproductive function and disturbance in the barred owl, great horned owl, and northern spotted owl</title><secondary-title>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><pages>109-137</pages><volume>1046</volume><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1196/annals.1343.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There is an urgent need for noninvasive methods to study reproduction and environmental stress in at-risk species such as the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Two related owl species (barred owl and great horned owl) were used as surrogates to validate hormone assays for fecal metabolites of progesterone, 17β-estradiol, testosterone, and corticosterone. Infusions of radiolabeled hormones showed that the owls excreted most hormone within 6 h. Feces and urine contained roughly equal amounts of hormone, and most fecal hormone metabolites were quite polar. The testosterone and corticosterone assays in this study bound to the major excreted metabolites of these hormones, but two progesterone assays did not appreciably bind to the major progesterone metabolites. All assays showed excellent parallelism with hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed samples and with previously dried or undried fecal samples. Thus, samples do not require hydrolysis or prior drying. Samples from a female barred owl had significantly higher fecal estrogen, lower fecal testosterone, and higher fecal estrogen/testosterone ratio than samples from two male barred owls. The fecal estrogen/testosterone ratio was the most accurate predictor of owl gender, particularly if two or more samples are available from the same individual. Fecal corticosterone metabolites also demonstrated considerable utility for wild northern spotted owls. Fecal glucocorticoid levels varied by gender and breeding stage, being highest in male northern spotted owls early in the breeding season and highest in females when nestlings were fledging. Collectively, these studies show that noninvasive fecal hormone measurements show great promise for noninvasive assessment of reproduction and stress in wild owls. © 2005 New York Academy of Sciences.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-23744460959&amp;doi=10.1196%2fannals.1343.010&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8bf1f0a56ac82e599a6d6ff034421621</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gerhardt, C.A.</author><author>Gutzwiller, J.</author><author>Huiet, K.A.</author><author>Fischer, S.</author><author>Noll, R.B.</author><author>Vannatta, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Parental Adjustment to Childhood Cancer: A Replication Study</title><secondary-title>Families, Systems and Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Families, Systems and Health</full-title></periodical><pages>263-275</pages><volume>25</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1037/1091-7527.25.3.263</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Using procedures identical to a study published 10 years earlier, parents of 49 children with cancer (48 mothers, 33 fathers) and 49 healthy classmates (49 mothers, 29 fathers) completed measures of adjustment an average of 18 months (SD = 7.4) postdiagnosis. Between-group differences were converted to effect sizes for each study and compared to assess replication. Mothers of children with cancer reported significantly more anxiety, less family conflict, and more social support than controls. Fathers did not differ between groups. Effect sizes were small for most comparisons of parental distress, family environment, and social support. Social support had little effect on distress. Despite the 10-year gap between studies, agreement on group differences was high, especially when evaluating effect sizes (94%) in addition to significance testing (67%). Parents of children with cancer exhibited significant resilience during treatment.

A point phenomenon is being detected and tracked by the activated sensors. The latter collect data characterizing parameters of the phenomenon; possibly compress it and transport it to a central node. The central node processes the received data to derive an estimate of the phenomenon's parameters. It is essential that the estimate reproduced at the center reflects the parameters characterizing the phenomenon at a sufficiently high fidelity level. Our sensing stochastic process models account for distance dependent observation noise perturbations as well as location dependent correlations between observation noise components, and assume sample mean estimates to be employed at the processing center. As such, they are distinctly different than corresponding models presented in the literature. We develop computationally efficient algorithms for determining the specific set of sensors to be activated, so that a sufficiently low reproduction distortion level can be attained. Corresponding algorithms are also derived for a system that operates under communications capacity constraints. For those sensor selection problems that are NP-hard, we introduce computationally efficient heuristic algorithms. We use our algorithms to present illustrative system performance results. We demonstrate that the activation of sensors that belong to a critical set of sensors can provide a distinct reduction in the distortion measure, while the activation of additional sensors outside such a set may not lead to further distinct estimate fidelity improvements.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35148883715&amp;doi=10.1109%2fMILCOM.2006.302289&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3ff483736162290d0c60de12881b93e8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, M.V.</author><author>Nyska, A.</author><author>Portier, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of a statistical dynamic model investigating the short-term cellular kinetics induced by riddelliine, a hepatic endothelial carcinogen</title><secondary-title>Toxicological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Toxicological Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>258-267</pages><volume>80</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/toxsci/kfh157</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In recent studies, riddelliine, a pyrrolizidine alkaloid, was found to increase rates of replication and apoptosis and induce hemangiosarcoma in the liver of rats and mice.

In this follow-up study, we measured viral replication 2 years after vaccination challenge and determined the mechanism by which antigen-specific CD8 T cells suppress viral replication. METHOD: From the original group of 18, we assessed the immune response in the 13 surviving animals. In addition, using cM-T807, we depleted CD8 lymphocytes to assess the role CD8 cells play in suppression of viral replication. RESULT: We found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinated animals had a robust simian immunodeficiency virus Gag-specific IFN-γ response. In addition, in the DNA and IL-15 group, we observed higher levels of simian immunodeficiency virus Gag-specific, proliferating CD8 T cells. The profile of these cells revealed more central memory than effector cells. When we transiently depleted animals of CD8 T cells, plasma viral load increased, and peak viral load was lower in the DNA and IL-15 group compared with the DNA alone and control groups. As CD8 T cells recovered, viral replication was controlled and we observed an increase in the number of antigen-specific effector CD8 T cells. CONCLUSION: We conclude that co-immunization with a simian/human immunodeficiency virus DNA-based vaccine and IL-15 achieves sustained viral suppression and that vaccine-induced CD8 memory T cells, which differentiate into effector cells, are central to that suppression. © 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-61849103667&amp;doi=10.1097%2fQAD.0b013e32830efdae&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=061b50752fa0563c3db53bcfd71a59e1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacCarthy, T.</author><author>Bergman, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coevolution of robustness, epistasis, and recombination favors asexual reproduction</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>12801-12806</pages><volume>104</volume><number>31</number><issue>31</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.0705455104</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The prevalence of sexual reproduction remains one of the most perplexing phenomena in evolutionary biology. The deterministic mutation hypothesis postulates that sexual reproduction will be advantageous under synergistic epistasis, a condition in which mutations cause a greater reduction in fitness when combined than would be expected from their individual effects. The inverse condition, antagonistic epistasis, correspondingly is predicted to favor asexual reproduction. To assess this hypothesis, we introduce a finite population evolutionary process that combines a recombination modifier formalism with a gene-regulatory network model. We demonstrate that when reproductive mode and epistasis are allowed to coevolve, asexual reproduction outcompetes sexual reproduction. In addition, no correlation is found between the level of synergistic epistasis and the fixation time of the asexual mode. However, a significant correlation is found between the level of antagonistic epistasis and asexual mode fixation time. This asymmetry can be explained by the greater reduction in fitness imposed by sexual reproduction as compared with asexual reproduction. Our findings present evidence and suggest plausible explanations that challenge both the deterministic mutation hypothesis and recent arguments asserting the importance of emergent synergistic epistasis in the maintenance of sexual reproduction. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34547890683&amp;doi=10.1073%2fpnas.0705455104&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=206f47ff6a50eb66a20fde894c8c75c2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borodina, Y.V.</author><author>Bolton, E.</author><author>Fontaine, F.</author><author>Bryant, S.H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of conformational ensemble sizes necessary for specific resolutions of coverage of conformational space</title><secondary-title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</full-title></periodical><pages>1428-1437</pages><volume>47</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/ci7000956</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The size of conformational ensembles required for regular coverage of the conformational space of druglike molecules was examined.

Structurally related compounds that bind to the AhR and exhibit biological actions similar to TCDD are commonly referred to as "dioxin-like compounds" (DLCs). Ambient human exposure to DLCs occurs through the ingestion of foods containing residues of DLCs that bioconcentrate through the food chain. Due to their lipophilicity and persistence, once internalized, they accumulate in body tissue, mainly adipose, resulting in chronic lifetime human exposure. Since human exposure to DLCs always involves a complex mixture, the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) methodology has been developed as a mathematical tool to assess the health risk posed by complex mixtures of these compounds. The TEF methodology is a relative potency scheme that ranks the dioxin-like activity of a compound relative to TCDD, which is the most potent congener. This allows for the estimation of the potential dioxin-like activity of a mixture of chemicals based on a common mechanism of action involving an initial binding of DLCs to the AhR. The toxic equivalency of DLCs was nominated for evaluation because of the widespread human exposure to DLCs and the lack of data on the adequacy of the TEF methodology for predicting relative potency for cancer risk. To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. TCDD is not manufactured commercially other than for scientific research purposes. The main sources of TCDD releases into the environment are from combustion and incineration; metal smelting, refining, and processing; chemical manufacturing and processing; biological and photochemical processes; and existing reservoir sources that reflect past releases. TCDD (dioxin) was selected for study by the National Toxicology Program as a part of the dioxin TEF evaluation to assess the cancer risk posed by complex mixtures of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and PCBs. The dioxin TEF evaluation includes conducting multiple 2-year rat bioassays to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs, structurally related PCBs, and mixtures of these compounds. While one of the aims of the dioxin TEF evaluation was a comparative analysis across studies, in this Technical Report, only the TCDD results are presented and discussed. TCDD was included because it is the reference compound for the dioxin TEF methodology. Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were administered TCDD (at least 98% pure) in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 14, 31, or 53 weeks or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse bone marrow cells. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of 81 or 82 female rats were administered 3, 10, 22, 46, or 100 ng TCDD/kg body weight in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage, 5 days per week, for up to 105 weeks; a group of 81 vehicle control female rats received the corn oil/acetone vehicle alone. Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, or 53 weeks. A stop-exposure group of 50 female rats was administered 100 ng/kg TCDD in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 30 weeks and then just the vehicle for the remainder of the study. Survival of dosed groups was similar to that of the vehicle control group. Mean body weights of 100 ng/kg core study and stop-exposure groups were less than those of the vehicle control group after week 13 of the study. Mean body weights of 46 ng/kg rats were less than those of the vehicle controls during year 2 of the study, and those of 22 ng/kg rats were less than those of the vehicle controls the last 10 weeks of the study. THYROID HORMONE CONCENTRATIONS: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels were evaluated at the 14-, 31- and 53-week interim evaluations. At 14 weeks, there were significant decreases in serum total and free thyroxine (T4) levels and increases in serum total triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). At 31 weeks, there were significant decreases in serum total and free T4 levels and increases in serum total T3 but no significant effect on TSH. At 53 weeks, there were significant decreases in serum total T4 levels and increases in serum total T3. There were no significant effects on total T4 or TSH levels. HEPATIC CELL PROLIFERATION DATA: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was conducted at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. The hepatocellular labeling index was significantly higher in the 22 ng/kg group compared to vehicle controls at 14 weeks. At the 31-week interim evaluation, the labeling indices in hepatocytes were significantly higher in all dosed groups than in the vehicle controls. At 53 weeks, labeling indices were significantly higher in the 46 and 100 ng/kg groups than in the vehicle controls. CYTOCHROME P450 ENZYME ACTIVITIES: To evaluate the expression of known dioxin-responsive genes, CYP1A1-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide-4-hydroxylase (A4H) activity were evaluated at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. In addition, pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (PROD) activity was analyzed. Hepatic EROD, PROD, and A4H activities were significantly higher in all dosed groups relative to vehicle controls at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. Pulmonary EROD was also significantly higher in all dosed groups compared to vehicle controls at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. DETERMINATIONS OF TCDD CONCENTRATIONS IN TISSUES: The tissue disposition of TCDD was analyzed in the liver, lung, fat, and blood of all animals in each group at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations and in 10 animals per group at the end of the 2-year study (105 weeks). The highest concentrations of TCDD were observed in the liver, followed by fat tissue. Liver and fat tissue concentrations of TCDD increased with increasing doses of TCDD. No measurable concentrations of TCDD were observed in blood from vehicle control or treated rats at any of the interim evaluations. Mean levels of TCDD in the liver and fat in the 100 ng/kg group at the end of the 2-year study were 9.3 and 3.2 ng/g, respectively. In liver tissue from the stop-exposure group, TCDD concentrations were slightly higher than those observed in the 3 ng/kg group. In the stop-exposure group, TCDD concentrations in fat were below the limits of quantitation. PATHOLOGY AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Absolute and/or relative liver weights were increased at 14, 31, and 53 weeks, with more severe effects occurring in the higher dosed groups. Increased liver weights correlated with increased incidences of hepatocyte hypertrophy at 14, 31, and 53 weeks. Exposure led to a treatment-related increase in hepatic toxicity with a broad spectrum of lesions. Incidences and severities of lesions increased at higher doses and longer durations of exposure. The earliest effects were increased incidences and severities of hepatocyte hypertrophy at 14 weeks. At 2 years, there was a significant increase in toxic hepatopathy characterized by increased incidences of numerous nonneoplastic liver lesions including hepatocyte hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, altered hepatocellular foci, inflammation, pigmentation, diffuse fatty change, necrosis, portal fibrosis, oval cell hyperplasia, bile duct hyperplasia, bile duct cysts, cholangiofibrosis, and nodular hyperplasia At 2 years, the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was significantly increased in the 100 ng/kg core study group. Dose-related increased incidences of cholangiocarcinoma were seen in core study rats administered 22 ng/kg or greater. The highest incidence of cholangiocarcinoma was seen in the 100 ng/kg core study group and included a significant number of animals with multiple cholangiocarcinomas. Two cholangiocarcinomas and two hepatocellular adenomas were seen in the 100 ng/kg stop-exposure group. Two hepatocholangiomas were seen in the 100 ng/kg core study group, and one cholangioma was seen in the 100 ng/kg stop-exposure group. In the lung, the incidence of cystic keratinizing epithelioma of the lung was significantly increased at 2 years in the 100 ng/kg core study group. Nonneoplastic effects in the lung included increased incidences of bronchiolar metaplasia. The incidence of gingival squamous cell carcinoma of the oral mucosa was significantly increased in the 100 ng/kg core study group at 2 years and was accompanied by an increased incidence of gingival squamous hyperplasia. At 2 years, the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterus in the 46 ng/kg group was significantly increased, and there were two squamous cell carcinomas in the 100 ng/kg stop-exposure group. At 2 years, one acinar adenoma and two acinar cell carcinomas of the pancreas were seen in the 100 ng/kg core study group; one acinar carcinoma was seen in the 100 ng/kg stop-exposure group. The incidences of acinar cell adenoma or carcinoma (combined) exceeded the historical vehicle control range. Nonneoplastic effects in the lung included acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization, chronic active inflammation, acinar atrophy, and arterial chronic active inflammation.

Our model targets new wireless communication techniques, such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, whose transmission ranges, called cells, are relatively small. The proposed model reproduces the mobility of nodes in an area by the observation of the incoming and outgoing nodes to the area. At first, we focus on a person as a node and observe an area where people actually pass through. From the observation results, we show that a node moves along with an approximately straight line with a velocity following a normal distribution. Furthermore, we propose two methods that estimate correspondences between incoming and outgoing events to the area; combinatorial optimization based method (COM) and Bayesian estimation based method (BEM). As a result, the reproduction ratio of COM is 0.736, and that of BEM is 1. © 2007 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

People who have sustained a fall are at greater risk of falling again. We replicated a British randomised controlled trial which demonstrated the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary intervention programme to prevent falls. The objective is to describe the design of a replication study evaluating a multidisciplinary intervention programme on recurrent falls and functional decline among elderly persons at risk. The study consists of an effect evaluation, an economic evaluation and a process evaluation. Methods/design: The programme is aimed at community-dwelling elderly people aged 65 years or over who have visited an accident and emergency department (A&amp;E department) or a general practitioners' cooperative (GP cooperative) because of a fall. The design involves a two-group randomised controlled trial. Participants are followed for twelve months after baseline. The intervention programme consists of a detailed medical and occupational therapy assessment with referral to relevant services if indicated. People in the control group receive usual care. The main outcome measures of the effect evaluation are number of falls and daily functioning. The economic evaluation will be performed from a societal perspective. A process evaluation will be carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention programme. © 2005 Hendriks et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-14544292969&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1471-2458-5-6&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ef9b4c2a9a2aff50c4179dd57a36deef</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fernando, C.</author><author>Von Kiedrowski, G.</author><author>Szathmáry, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A stochastic model of nonenzymatic nucleic acid replication: "Elongators" sequester replicators</title><secondary-title>Journal of Molecular Evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Molecular Evolution</full-title></periodical><pages>572-585</pages><volume>64</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00239-006-0218-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The origin of nucleic acid template replication is a major unsolved problem in science. A novel stochastic model of nucleic acid chemistry was developed to allow rapid prototyping of chemical experiments designed to discover sufficient conditions for template replication. Experiments using the model brought to attention a robust property of nucleic acid template populations, the tendency for elongation to outcompete replication. Externally imposed denaturation-renaturation cycles did not reverse this tendency. For example, it has been proposed that fast tidal cycling could establish a TCR (tidal chain reaction) analogous to a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) acting on nucleic acid polymers, allowing their self-replication. However, elongating side-reactions that would have been prevented by the polymerase in the PCR still occurred in the simulation of the TCR. The same finding was found with temperature and monomer cycles. We propose that if cycling reactors are to allow template replication, oligonucleotide phenotypes that are capable of favorably altering the flux ratio between replication and elongation, for example, by facilitating sequence-specific cleavage within templates, are necessary; accordingly the minimal replicase ribozyme may have possessed restriction functionality. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34248138477&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00239-006-0218-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=cf0530ab8ec5f276dc726e5811f3f078</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, C.-F.</author><author>Wu, Z.-A.</author><author>Hou, X.-R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of dental repair between computer-assisted dental shade devices and dental shade guide</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research</full-title></periodical><pages>6855-6858</pages><volume>12</volume><number>35</number><issue>35</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Background: Recently, device for color detection is used in dental repair. However, whether computer-aided shade devices can replace traditional dental shade guide is still uncertain. Objective: To investigate the clinical effect of three different computer-aided tooth shade devices and dental shade guide in teeth color matching. Design, Time and Setting: Comparison and observation were performed at the Department of Stomatology, the 359 Hospital of Chinese PLA between November 2005 and February 2007. Participants: Sixty-four patients (242 dental restorations) were included and randomly divided into 4 groups (n=16). Methods: Color detection of the first three groups was conducted using three kinds of computer-aided tooth shade devices, including Shade-Eye-NCC, Vita Easyshade and ShadeVision, and the other group was detected using dental shade guide (Vitapan 3D-Master). Ceramic full crown was made according to selected color. Main Outcome Measures: The rates of agreement of three actual devices were analyzed. After restoration, the rates of satisfaction of color check were recorded to evaluate color replication effect. Results: The best performance was available by Vitapan 3D-Master (P &lt; 0.05). The better agreement and satisfactory of the evaluated devices was obtained - generally as well as among the human testers - by Shade-Eye-NCC and Vita Easyshade system compared with ShadeVision system (P &lt; 0.05). While no obvious differences were shown between Shade-Eye-NCC and Vita Easyshade system. Conclusion: Rates of color agreement using computer-aided color shade determination is not high, and the satisfactory rate is lower than visual detection. Thus, currently computer-aided color shade determination could not replace visual detection.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-55049084054&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2ec6341a2b6a82ba6bada266667e82cc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shepherd, B.E.</author><author>Guttorp, P.</author><author>Lansdorp, P.M.</author><author>Abkowitz, J.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating human hematopoietic stem cell kinetics using granulocyte telomere lengths</title><secondary-title>Experimental Hematology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental Hematology</full-title></periodical><pages>1040-1050</pages><volume>32</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.exphem.2004.07.023</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To study in vivo behavior of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Behavior of HSC is difficult to study because one cannot observe and track cells within the marrow microenvironment. Therefore, information must be obtained from indirect means, such as competitive repopulation assays or surrogate studies, such as observations of telomere shortening in granulocytes. In this article, we use granulocyte telomere length data and a novel approach, stochastic simulation, to derive replication rates of HSC. The approach is first applied to cats and then to humans. Human HSC replicate infrequently, on average once per 45 weeks (range: once per 23 to once per 67 weeks). This rate is substantially slower than the average replication rates estimated for murine (once per 2.5 weeks) and feline (once per 8.3-10 weeks) HSC in vivo. © 2004 International Society for Experimental Hematology.

To gain insight into the mechanisms by which Chk1 carries out these functions, we used mass spectrometry to identify previously uncharacterized interacting partners of Chk1. We describe a novel interaction between Chk1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an essential component of the replication machinery. Binding between Chk1 and PCNA was reduced in the presence of hydroxyurea, suggesting that the interaction is regulated by replication stress. A highly conserved PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box motif was identified in Chk1. The intact PIP box is required for efficient DNA damage-induced phosphorylation and release of activated Chk1 from chromatin. We find that the PIP box of Chk1 is crucial for Chk1-mediated S-M and G2-M checkpoint responses. In addition, we show that mutations in the PIP box of Chk1 lead to decreased rates of replication fork progression and increased aberrant replication. These findings suggest an additional mechanism by which essential components of the DNA replication machinery interact with the replication checkpoint apparatus. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-47749148089&amp;doi=10.1074%2fjbc.M800369200&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=306d0c7670589dc39bd05273bffea563</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Orsel, K.</author><author>Dekker, A.</author><author>Bouma, A.</author><author>Stegeman, J.A.</author><author>de Jong, M.C.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantification of foot and mouth disease virus excretion and transmission within groups of lambs with and without vaccination</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title></periodical><pages>2673-2679</pages><volume>25</volume><number>14</number><issue>14</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.11.048</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sheep are well known to be susceptible for foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), but it is unknown whether the infection can spread and persist in a sheep population. We therefore quantified virus transmission by performing experiments with FMD virus strain O/NET/2001 in groups of lambs. We used six groups of four lambs each, in which half of each group was inoculated and the other half was contact-exposed. To quantify the effectiveness of a single vaccination we also included six groups of four lambs each, vaccinated with O Manisa vaccine, 14 days prior to inoculation. Oropharyngeal fluid was obtained with a swab (OPF-swab), and blood samples were collected daily to determine virus excretion and serological response. We calculated the transmission rate β (the number of new infections per day per infectious animal), and the reproduction ratio R (the number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual). The mean daily virus excretion and the number of days the lambs excreted virus in the OPF differed significantly between vaccinated and non-vaccinated lambs. The transmission rate β in the unvaccinated groups was 0.105 (95% confidence limit 0.044; 0.253) per day. The duration of the infectious period (T) was 21.11 (95% confidence limit 10.6; 42.1) days. With the final size of infection we estimated the reproduction ratio R in the non-vaccinated groups to be 1.14 (0.3; 3.3), and in vaccinated groups 0.22 (0.01; 1.78). Virus transmission as quantified by the final size did not differ statistically between the vaccinated and the non-vaccinated groups of lambs. In conclusion, FMDV seems able to persist in a sheep population, although the reproduction ratio was only slightly larger than one. As a consequence, vaccination might only have a small effect on transmission, in spite of the fact that virus excretion and duration of virus excretion is significantly reduced after vaccination. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted reproduction experiments in four different species (Moina macrocopa, M. micrura, Ceriodaphnia dubia and C. reticulata) of cladoceran to test for the first time whether the occurrence of this phenomenon after exposure of the parent to such hormones is a generalized phenomenon. In the presence of a juvenile hormone analog, fenoxycarb, all four species produced male neonates and showed reduced rates of reproduction. The estimated median effective concentration (EC50) for the production of male neonates varied with species, ranging from 0.60 × 103 to 9.3 × 103 ng/l. Although there was a wide range of sensitivity to fenoxycarb, the production of male neonates in all four species demonstrates that this phenomenon is a common response to juvenile hormone analogs and further suggests that these hormones are capable of initiating sexual reproduction in cladocerans, most of which exhibit cyclic parthenogenesis. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Piglets that express an adhesion site for F4+ E. coli in their small intestine (F4R+) shed higher numbers of F4+ E. coli than piglets lacking this site (F4R-). We hypothesized that F4R+ piglets are more infectious and more susceptible for F4+ E. coli. This implies that in populations with F4R+ and F4R- piglets, the transmission would be dependent on the frequency of both types of animals. To quantify the difference in infectiousness and susceptibility, a one-to-one transmission experiment was performed with 20 pairs consisting of one inoculated and one contact piglet. Based on the contact infections observed, transmission parameters were estimated with generalized linear models. F4R+ piglets were infectious for other piglets and the reproduction ratio (R0) for homogeneous F4R+ populations, that is the average number of secondary infections that one F4R+ pig will cause during its entire infectious period in a population of susceptible F4R+ individuals only, was estimated as 7.1. F4R+ piglets were more susceptible than F4R- piglets and reducing the fraction of F4R+ piglets of a population will reduce transmission. It was calculated that in order to prevent major outbreaks of F4+ E. coli (R0&lt;1), the fraction of F4R+ piglets must be lower than 0.14. © 2004 Cambridge University Press.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-10444255458&amp;doi=10.1017%2fS0950268804002675&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=816db71a62cb714e7651e6668c9a8c47</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fredericksen, B.L.</author><author>Smith, M.</author><author>Katze, M.G.</author><author>Shi, P.-Y.</author><author>Gale Jr., M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The host response to West Nile Virus infection limits viral spread through the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 pathway</title><secondary-title>Journal of Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>7737-7747</pages><volume>78</volume><number>14</number><issue>14</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JVI.78.14.7737-7747.2004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent outbreaks of West Nile Virus (WNV) have been associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality in humans, birds, and many other species. We have initiated studies to define the molecular mechanisms by which a recent pathogenic isolate of WNV evades the host cell innate antiviral response. Biochemical and microarray analyses demonstrated that WNV induced the expression of beta interferon (IFN-β) and several IFN-stimulated genes late in infection of cultured human cells. The late expression of these antiviral genes was due to the delayed activation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Despite this host response, WNV was still able to replicate efficiently. The effect of the IRF-3 pathway on WNV replication was assessed by examining virus replication and spread in cultures of wild-type or IRF-3-null mouse embryo fibroblasts. The absence of IRF-3 was marked by a significant increase in plaque size and a sustained production of infectious particles. Although the activation of the IRF-3 pathway was not sufficient to block virus replication, our results suggest that IRF-3 target genes function to constrain WNV infection and limit cell-to-cell virus spread.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3142692686&amp;doi=10.1128%2fJVI.78.14.7737-7747.2004&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e15db57e879470208725aa5171c6f7b8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, J.</author><author>Shen, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of generalization error: Random and fixed inputs</title><secondary-title>Statistica Sinica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Statistica Sinica</full-title></periodical><pages>569-588</pages><volume>16</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>In multicategory classification, an estimated generalization error is often used to quantify a classifier's generalization ability.

This article proposes an estimation methodology for the generalization error, permitting a treatment of both fixed and random inputs, which is in contrast to the conditional classification error commonly used in the statistics literature. In particular, we derive a novel data perturbation technique, that jointly perturbs both inputs and outputs, to estimate the generalization error. We show that the proposed technique yields optimal tuning and combination, as measured by generalization. We also demonstrate via simulation that it outperforms cross-validation for both fixed and random designs, in the context of margin classification.

This replication study employs an experimental design that presents the same set of responses to raters in four different formats. A second experiment is conducted to explore the extent to which the presentation effect can be reduced by supplemental training that focuses specifically on the causes of this presentation effect and includes practice scoring of responses presented in different formats. As Powers et al. and Russell and Tao found, the first experiment indicates that responses to composition test items presented in handwritten form receive significantly higher scores than the same responses presented in computer-print form. This effect is due to the visibility of errors and higher expectations for computer-printed responses coupled with increased identity with the writer generated by handwriting. Through supplemental training, the presentation effect was eliminated. © 2004, PAREonline.net.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33947723816&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7213b93c21a1cbcd4b470d5161e65752</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frederickson, M.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ant species confer different partner benefits on two neotropical myrmecophytes</title><secondary-title>Oecologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oecologia</full-title></periodical><pages>387-395</pages><volume>143</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00442-004-1817-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The dynamics of mutualistic interactions involving more than a single pair of species depend on the relative costs and benefits of interaction among alternative partners. The neotropical myrmecophytes Cordia nodosa and Duroia hirsuta associate with several species of obligately symbiotic ants. I compared the ant partners of Cordia and Duroia with respect to two benefits known to be important in ant-myrmecophyte interactions: protection against herbivores provided by ants, and protection against encroaching vegetation provided by ants. Azteca spp., Myrmelachista schumanni, and Allomerus octoarticulatus demerarae ants all provide the leaves of Cordia and Duroia some protection against herbivores. However, Azteca and Allomerus provide more protection than does Myrmelachista to the leaves of their host plants. Although Allomerus protects the leaves of its hosts, plants occupied by Allomerus suffer more attacks by herbivores to their stems than do plants occupied by other ants. Relative to Azteca or Allomerus, Myrmelachista ants provide better protection against encroaching vegetation, increasing canopy openness over their host plants. These differences in benefits among the ant partners of Cordia and Duroia are reflected in the effect of each ant species on host plant size, growth rate, and reproduction. The results of this study show how mutualistic ant partners can differ with respect to both the magnitude and type of benefits they provide to the same species of myrmecophytic host. © Springer-Verlag 2005.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-17844364655&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs00442-004-1817-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b963df5d2baeab5d01f4ed9d6b7206fc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Geenen, P.L.</author><author>Döpfer, D.</author><author>Van der Meulen, J.</author><author>De Jong, M.C.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transmission of F4+ E. coli in groups of early weaned piglets</title><secondary-title>Epidemiology and Infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Epidemiology and Infection</full-title></periodical><pages>459-468</pages><volume>133</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0950268804003292</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this study was to estimate transmission parameters of enterotoxigenic F4+ Escherichia coli F4 (F4+ E. coli) in groups of early weaned piglets with F4-receptor-positive (F4R+) and F4-receptor-negative piglets (F4R-). Transmission of F4+ E. coli was quantified in four heterogeneous groups of F4R+ and F4R- piglets. Infectiousness was determined by the number of F4+ E. coli/g faeces shed during 8 days. Transmission parameters were estimated using generalized linear models assuming a stochastic SIR model. F4R+ piglets were found to be more susceptible than F4R- piglets, but F4R+ and F4R- piglets were not different in infectiousness. The reproduction ratios for homogeneous F4R+ and F4R- populations were estimated as 6.37 (95% CI 1.89-21.48) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00-1.13) respectively. The implication of these results is that in order to prevent major outbreaks, the fraction of F4R+ piglets should be small (approximately 10% or less). Therefore, selective breeding programmes could contribute to reducing F4+ E. coli-related diarrhoea and transmission. © 2004 Cambridge University Press.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-20844446608&amp;doi=10.1017%2fS0950268804003292&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5c0f2d5ab90a26fdd70494aeb948df3d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nagpal, P.</author><author>Lyytinen, K.</author><author>Helper, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>I.T.

An access to a common dataset and availability of well matched analogs allow execution of these replications. Our results show robustness of some constructs across studies in predicting aspects of IT value.

These studies are very important because the assisted reproduction techniques (mainly intracytoplasmic sperm injection) bypass the natural selection process and some classical chromosomal abnormalities, microdeletions of AZF genes or some deleterious genic mutations could pass through generations. These genetic abnormalities can cause in the offspring of these patients male infertility, ambiguous external genitalia, mental retardation, and other birth defects. We studied 165 infertile men whose infertility was attributable to testicular problems (60 were azoospermic, 100 were oligospermic and 5 were asthenospermic). We studied 100 metaphases per patient with GTG banding obtained from temporary lymphocyte culture for chromosomal abnormality detection and performed a genomic DNA analysis using 28 Y chromosome-specific sequence-tagged sites for Y AZF microdeletion detection. Karyotyping revealed somatic anomalies in 16 subjects (16/165 = 9.6%). Of these 16, 12 were in the azoospermic group (12/60 = 20%) and 4 were in the oligospermic group (4/100 = 4%). The most common chromosomal anomaly was Minefelter syndrome (10/165 = 6%). Microdeletions of AZF genes were detected in 12 subjects (12/160 = 7.5%). The frequencies detected are similar to those described previously. These results show the importance of genetic evaluation of infertile males prior to assisted reproduction. Such evaluation can lead to genetic counseling and, consequently, to primary and secondary prevention of mental retardation and birth defects. © 2006 Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33645803647&amp;doi=10.1590%2fS0100-879X2006000400017&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dfa4677450cdd3eeefd095f6bee66687</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morrison, P.F.</author><author>Chattoraj, D.K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication of a unit-copy plasmid F in the bacterial cell cycle: A replication rate function analysis</title><secondary-title>Plasmid</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plasmid</full-title></periodical><pages>13-30</pages><volume>52</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.plasmid.2004.04.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>For stability, the replication of unit-copy plasmids ought to occur by a highly controlled process. We have characterized the replication dynamics of a unit-copy plasmid F by a replication rate function defined as the probability per unit age interval of the cell cycle that a plasmid will initiate replication. Analysis of baby-machine data [J. Bacteriol. 170 (1988) 1380; J. Bacteriol. 179 (1997) 1393] by stochastics that make no detailed reference to underlying mechanism revealed that this rate function increased monotonically over the cell cycle with rapid increase near cell division. This feature is highly suggestive of a replication control mechanism that is designed to force most plasmids to replicate before cells undergo division. The replication rate function is developed anew from a mechanistic model incorporating the hypotheses that initiators are limiting and that steric hindrance of origins by handcuffing control initiation of replication. The model is based on correctly folded initiator protein monomers arising from an inactive dimer pool via chaperones in limiting amounts, their random distribution to high affinity sites (iterons) at the origin (ori) and an outside locus (incC), the statistical mechanics of bound monomer participation in pairing the two loci (cis-handcuffing), and initiation probability as proportional to the number of non-handcuffed ori-saturated plasmids. Provided cis-handcuffing is present, this model closely accounts for the shape of the replication rate function derived from experiment, and reproduces the observation that replication occurs throughout the cell cycle. Present concepts of iteron-based molecular mechanisms thus appear capable of yielding a quantitative description of unit-copy-number plasmid replication dynamics.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3042605185&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.plasmid.2004.04.001&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ef949c15103f269f9955cae3abfa7603</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, K.</author><author>Qiu, Q.</author><author>Jiang, J.</author><author>Yang, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Non-invasive glucose sensing with near-infrared spectroscopy enhanced by optical measurement conditions reproduction technique</title><secondary-title>Optics and Lasers in Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Optics and Lasers in Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>1096-1106</pages><volume>43</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.optlaseng.2004.06.018</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Non-invasive glucose sensing utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been a focusing topic in biomedical optics applications.

The study also examined the differential effects of each modality on students' acquisition of vocal behavior. Participants Were tWo elementary school students With autism enrolled in a suburban public school. Training sessions involved presentations of preferred items, prompting and prompt fading procedures. Probes Were conducted to evaluate the generalization of learned mands to classroom teachers. For one participant, sign language training produced a higher percentage of independent mands. PECS training produced a higher percentage of independent mands for the other participant. For both participants, sign language training produced a higher percentage of vocalizations during training. Mands learned With the experimenter generalized to classroom teachers. The results of the study suggest that acquisition of picture exchange and sign language may vary as a function of individual student characteristics, specifically, motor imitation skills prior to intervention.

However, little attention has been given to the importance of dietary and combined exposure as the source for uptake. In the present study, we compared cadmium uptake from waterborne (water-only), dietary (food-only), and combined (water plus food) exposures on the freshwater cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia. Major test end points included cadmium whole-body burdens, feeding rate, and reproduction. The C. dubia three-brood reproduction tests were conducted according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency methods. The results indicated that cadmium was accumulated from both water and diet. Whereas the results showed that uptake from water was more rapid than uptake from diet, both uptakes occurred independently, and cadmium concentrations in C. dubia were additive from both sources. Furthermore, the present study found cadmium trophic transfer between primary producers (i.e., Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and primary consumers (i.e., C. dubia). Feeding rate was reduced from all avenues of exposure. Feeding reduction in combined exposure was affected additively by waterborne and dietary cadmium. Also, reductions in neonate production were observed after exposure to all three exposure types. Both body burden and reduced feeding affected C. dubia reproduction. These results indicate the importance of both waterborne and dietary cadmium exposures as the sources for metal uptake and toxicity. © 2007 SETAC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34047192051&amp;doi=10.1897%2f06-232R.1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0b3229723e9c882fa5daaf1f5fa3054b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jourdain, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decision-makers selective use of ped and PSD assessment tools: Supporting of institutional innovations, reluctance to pay for dependency</title><secondary-title>Gerontologie et Societe</secondary-title><short-title>L'usage sélectif des évaluations des ped et psd par le décideur: Soutien aux innovations institutionnelles, réticence àpayer le prix de la dépendance</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gerontologie et Societe</full-title></periodical><pages>255-270</pages><volume>99</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3917/gs.099.0255</electronic-resource-num><abstract>At the beginning of the nineties, the policy for dependent elderly people in France was characterised by the absence of vision of the parties involved.

The precision was tested by analyzing four replicated MRI datasets of human knees in 14 individuals. The algorithms were shown to produce accurate data in geometric test objects. The interscan precision was &lt;4% (CV%) for surface area, 2.9-5.7 m-1 (SD) for the mean principal curvature, and 4.1-7.4 m-1 for congruence indices. Incongruity was highest in the femoropatellar joint (79.7 m-1) and lowest in the medial femorotibial joint (28.6 m-1).

The family Proteaceae, in particular, has dominated such research conducted in Australia. Thus it is now timely to present a critical review of the breeding and mating systems of the Australian Proteaceae. It is hoped that this will stimulate further research. The review covers key events between pollen deposition on stigmas through to fruit set. The genus Banksia, although not the most diverse of the family, has received a disproportionate amount of attention. It has featured in nine published studies of self-compatibility compared to 13 studies spanning the other 45 genera and has featured in eight genetic studies of the mating system compared to just two on other genera. Few studies have assessed the timing of stigma receptivity despite the intriguing situation in most Proteaceae of auto-deposition of self-pollen on or near stigmas at anthesis. Studies suggest that stigmas are not receptive until 0.5–4 days after anthesis. Banksia species appear to show low levels of self-compatibility although one subspecies shows high levels of selfing and evidence of selective fruit development. Self-compatibility may be more common in other genera, although a dearth of studies precludes generalisation. Assessment of mating systems indicates almost complete outcrossing for most species, lending support to the idea of selective fruit development. It is clear that many further studies of all topics are required but particularly across a wide range of genera because many have not been studied at all. © 1998, CSIRO.

The former type of reactors had earthworm populations and feed loading rates similar to ones recommended by previous workers. The `high-rate' reactors were operated with 12.5 times higher earthworm densities and feed loading rates. All the reactors were studied for six months to assess the vermicast output, survivability, growth and reproduction of the earthworms - hence the sustainability of the reactors - for long-term, continuous operation. The studies revealed the viability of the high-rate vermireactor concept. The high-rate reactors consistently produced over 6.5 times more castings per unit digester volume with no adverse effect on the earthworm population, as reflected by (a) absence of mortality, (b) consistent growth in worm zoomass, and (c) normal rate of reproduction. The studies also revealed that an increase in the cowdung fraction in the feed from 14.3% to 20% (4:1 paper:cowdung blends to 6:1 blends) had little positive impact on the vermicast output or earthworm health. This indicated that spiking of paper feed with ∼14% cowdung, or perhaps an even smaller fraction, might be adequate to support earthworms in the paper-fed vermireactors.

More recently, the concept of attachment has been extended to adults, and several measures that purport to measure attachment style have been developed. The purpose of the present study was to provide a reliability generalization study of five of the most prominent adult attachment style measures. Reliability generalization, a relatively new meta-analytic reliability procedure, was used to (a) identify the typical reliability of scores across instruments and studies and (b) examine sources of measurement error across instruments and studies. Results from this investigation of 154 previously published research studies indicated that the average score reliability across studies varied considerably across instruments and subscales. Implications for the use of self-report measures of adult attachment style are offered.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036352403&amp;doi=10.1177%2f0013164402062004006&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2a2a9ef4231d0354ffdbe187c54a7e13</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Müller, K.</author><author>Mermod, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The histone-interacting domain of nuclear factor I activates simian virus 40 DNA replication in vivo</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>1645-1650</pages><volume>275</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.275.3.1645</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Efficient initiation of SV40 DNA replication requires transcription factors that bind auxiliary sequences flanking the minimally required origin. To evaluate the possibility that transcription factors may activate SV40 replication by acting on the chromatin structure of the origin, we used an in vivo replication system in which we targeted GAL4 fusion proteins to the minimally required origin. We found that the proline-rich transcriptional activation domain of nuclear factor I (NF-I), which has been previously shown to interact with histone H3, specifically activates replication. Evaluation of a series of deletion and point mutants of NF-I indicates that the H3- binding domain and the replication activity coincide perfectly. Assays with other transcription factors, such as Sp1, confirmed the correlation between the interaction with H3 and the activation of replication. These findings imply that transcription factors such as NF-I can activate SV40 replication via direct interaction with chromatin components, thereby contributing to the relief of nucleosomal repression at the SV40 origin.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0039601066&amp;doi=10.1074%2fjbc.275.3.1645&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c10cce59d6a9468a88a218defc63a82b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lalli, J.S.</author><author>Mace, F.C.</author><author>Livezey, K.</author><author>Kates, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of stimulus generalization gradients in the treatment of self-injurious behavior</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</full-title></periodical><pages>479-483</pages><volume>31</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1901/jaba.1998.31-479</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Descriptive and experimental analyses suggested that the self-injurious behavior (SIB) of a 10-year-old girl with severe mental retardation was maintained by attention.

Based on these findings, we systematically varied the distance between the participant and a therapist to assess stimulus generalization. Results showed that rates of SIB varied relative to the distance between the participant and therapist; the highest percentage of SIB occurred with the therapist positioned less than 0.5 m from the participant. Treatment consisted of placing the therapist at a specified distance (9.0 m) from the participant (during low-attention situations), noncontingent reinforcement, and extinction.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032161092&amp;doi=10.1901%2fjaba.1998.31-479&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5f003883e1d56a7c0792366d73480785</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hayes, M.M.</author><author>Lane, B.R.</author><author>King, S.R.</author><author>Markovitz, D.M.</author><author>Coffey, M.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prostaglandin E2 inhibits replication of HIV-1 in macrophages through activation of protein kinase A</title><secondary-title>Cellular Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cellular Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>61-71</pages><volume>215</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0008-8749(02)00017-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Since macrophages are a source of increased PGE2 in AIDS, we investigated the role of PGE2 in the replication of HIV-1 in these cells. PGE2 inhibited HIV-1 replication measured by reverse transcriptase in human monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM). Treatment of MDM with the PGE1 analog misoprostol, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, and the cyclic AMP analog dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (db-cAMP) suppressed HIV replication. The protein kinase A (PKA) activator 8-bromo-cyclic AMP also inhibited HIV-1 replication. Similar results were observed with the entry-independent, latently HIV-infected U1 cells. There was a parallel decrease in HIV-1 mRNA levels following PGE2 treatment. Co-transfection of the HIV-1 promoter LTR.luciferase, with the vector CMV.Cα, which expresses the PKA catalytic unit increasing PKA activity, reduced HIV-1 promoter activity. Inhibition of PKA activity with the pMT.RAB vector, a mutant regulatory unit of PKA, augmented HIV-1 promoter activity. In summary, PGE2 inhibits HIV-1 gene expression in MDM through a PKA-dependent mechanism. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

We assessed 'false negative' error rates in differential expression analyses by conventional linear statistical models (e.g. t-test), microarray-adapted variants (e.g. SAM, Cyber-T), and a novel strategy based on hold-out cross-validation. The latter approach employs the machine-learning algorithm Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) to infer minimum thresholds for reliable change in gene expression from Boolean conjunctions of fold-induction and raw fluorescence measurements. Results: Monte Carlo analyses based on four empirical data sets show that conventional statistical models and their microarray-adapted variants overlook more than 50% of genes showing significant up-regulation. Conjoint PRIM prediction rules recover approximately twice as many differentially expressed transcripts while maintaining strong control over false-positive (Type I) errors. As a result, experimental replication rates increase and total analytic error rates decline. RT-PCR studies confirm that gene inductions detected by PRIM but overlooked by other methods represent true changes in mRNA levels. PRIM-based conjoint inference rules thus represent an improved strategy for high-sensitivity screening of DNA microarrays.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141506115&amp;doi=10.1093%2fbioinformatics%2fbtg242&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=75842a47871901593e8cba895c1ee1cc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brown, S.R.</author><author>Finan, P.J.</author><author>Hall, N.R.</author><author>Bishop, D.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incidence of DNA replication errors in patients with multiple primary cancers</title><secondary-title>Diseases of the Colon and Rectum</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Diseases of the Colon and Rectum</full-title></periodical><pages>765-769</pages><volume>41</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF02236266</electronic-resource-num><abstract>PURPOSE: Multiple primary cancers are a feature of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer in which defects in DNA repair mechanisms result in accumulation of replication errors within tumor DNA. We assessed replication error incidence in multiple primary cancer patients who may have similar genetic defects. METHODS: DNA was obtained from 69 patients from the Yorkshire region who had developed colorectal cancer and one other primary tumor from the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer tumor spectrum (28 colorectal, 12 stomach, 15 ovary, and 14 uterus). DNA was also obtained from 86 sporadic, single primary cancer patients attending a colorectal cancer clinic. Replication error status was assessed at five microsatellite loci using fluorescent polymerase chain reaction and computer-assisted analysis. RESULTS: The replication error phenotype was observed in 7 of 86 (8 percent) of the sporadic single primary patients. This compared with 23 of 69 (33 percent) of the multiple primary group (P &lt; 0.001). Replication error was also observed more frequently in each subgroup. Even excluding patients from families meeting the Amsterdam criteria (likely to be hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and have the replication error phenotype), this increased frequency remained in both the multiple primary group (P &lt; 0.005) and multiple colorectal and colorectal/uterine subgroups (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that genetic instability plays an important role in development of multiple primary cancers, particularly from certain cancer subsets. Testing for replication errors may be an appropriate way of identifying individuals at risk of multiple primary cancers.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031860840&amp;doi=10.1007%2fBF02236266&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0479c588ccf2d9e24f69d3499948b7e6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cudin, I.</author><author>De Bona, F.</author><author>Gambitta, A.</author><author>Pérennès, F.</author><author>Turchet, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heat load problems in deep X-ray lithography</title><secondary-title>Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment</full-title></periodical><pages>1265-1268</pages><volume>467-468</volume><number>PART II</number><issue>PART II</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0168-9002(01)00655-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A 3D mathematical model of a complete Deep X-Ray Lithography scanning unit based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) was developed to analyse the replication errors induced by the thermoelastic deformations occurring under irradiation.

She points out that in creating the instruments for measuring the self-perception of preschool children and children in the lower grades of elementary school, it is necessary to take into account some of their developmental psychological characteristics, such as short-span attention, inconsistency in their answers, tendency to give socially acceptable answers, etc. A new self-report instrument, the Scale of Self-Perception for School Children (SPSC) is described. The scale was tested in research which involved 240 children attending the first to fourth grades of elementary school (they are from 7 to 11 years old). The purpose of the study is to investigate the psychometric properties of SPSC. Dimensionality, internal consistency, and validity of the scale were adequate. Girls rated themselves higher on academic competence and artistic aesthetic competence and interest in artistic activities, while boys rated themselves higher on negative behaviour and motor competence. Significant grade differences were found in self-perception of anxiousness and social acceptance. Replication studies using clinical groups and samples from different cultures will be needed to assess the generalizability of the results. © 2002 Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34247225459&amp;doi=10.1080%2f03004430210879&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=de1704ad4c73af72a0f8a24ac812dc2e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baldrick, P.</author><author>Robinson, J.A.</author><author>Hepburn, P.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reproduction studies in the rat with shea oleine and hardened shea oleine</title><secondary-title>Food and Chemical Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Food and Chemical Toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>923-930</pages><volume>39</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0278-6915(01)00043-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Shea oleine is an oil fraction derived from the nut of the tree Butyrospermum parkii, which grows in central and western Africa. There are several uses of shea oleine including its use as a frying oil and, after hardening, in margarine and toffee fat. This investigation was performed to examine the toxicity of 7 or 15% hardened shea oleine in comparison with 7 or 15% unhardened shea oleine and various commercially available materials, sheanut and palm oils, cocoa butter and toffee powder following dietary administration to rats during pre-mating, mating, pregnancy and offspring weaning in two separate investigations. Reproduction was assessed using number of litters and pups born plus survival and body weights at birth and at weaning on day 21. Skeletal evaluation using X-ray, clinical pathology and a macroscopic examination were also performed for F1 rats. Study measures for parent animals comprised evaluation of body weight, food consumption, clinical pathology, organ weights and macroscopic examination. Fatty acids and hydrocarbon levels were measured and an evaluation for lipogranulomata was made for various tissues. Results showed that shea oleine, whether unhardened or hardened, produced no evidence of reproduction toxicity and gave a similar profile to the other commercially available materials used in this study in the rat. Minor findings with shea oleine were not related to reproduction performance but comprised slightly reduced body weight gain and reduced cholesterol and raised alkaline phosphatase levels. None of the findings in this study were considered to be of toxicological significance. Thus, no evidence of reproduction toxicity was seen for both unhardened and hardened shea oleine in this investigation in the rat at levels equating to greater than 7.5 g/kg/day. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The map is formed in the brain with elements that allow for generalization beyond the region of training. We quantified spatial generalization properties of these elements by training in one extreme of the reachable space and testing near another. Training resulted in rotations in the preferred direction (PD) of activation of some arm muscles. We designed force fields that maintained a constant rotation in muscle PDs as the shoulder joint rotated in the horizontal plane. In such fields, training in a small region resulted in generalization to near and far work spaces (80 cm). In one such field, the forces on the hand reversed directions for a given hand velocity with respect to the location of original training. Despite this, there was generalization. However, if the field was such that the change in the muscle PDs reversed as the work spaces changed, then performance was worse than performance of naive subjects. We suggest that the sensorimotor map of arm dynamics is represented in the brain by elements that globally encode the position of the arm but locally encode its velocity. The elements have preferred directions of movement but are modulated globally by the position of the shoulder joint. We suggest that tuning properties of cells in the motor system influence behavior and that this influence is reflected in the way that we learn dynamics of reaching movements.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034667569&amp;doi=10.1523%2fjneurosci.20-20-07807.2000&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9f37be079233544a161ce7d6343f3d6f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Onoda, Takashi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Experimental analysis of generalization capability based on information criteria</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks - Conference Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><pages>114-119</pages><volume>1</volume><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Feed-forward neural networks are nonlinear parametric models that can approximate any continuous input-output relation.

This paper presents an experimental analysis to measure the quality of the approximation or the generalization capability for artificial feed-forward neural networks. Our approach analyzes the relation between some information criteria and the generalization capability statistically and experimentally. These information criteria are used to select the best model and the generalization capability is a measure of the quality of approximation. We make clear the feature of some information criteria. These information criteria are AIC, NIC, IC(N,K), and NNIC. AIC is Akaike's Information Criterion. NIC is Network Information Criterion. IC(N,K) is Information Criterion of N and K. N is the number of learning examples. K is the number of independently adjusted parameters. NNIC is Neural Network Information Criterion. Moreover, our experiments compare the generalization capability with the value of these information criteria. Finally, this paper shows that NNIC is effective to measure the quality of the approximation or the generalization capability for artificial feed-forward neural networks.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029727597&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=918c2ca2b0921d4c66582ce1374a5424</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lánský, P.</author><author>Weiss, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does the dose-solubility ratio affect the mean dissolution time of drugs?</title><secondary-title>Pharmaceutical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharmaceutical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1470-1476</pages><volume>16</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1018923714107</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose. To present a new model for describing drug dissolution. On the basis of the new model to characterize the dissolution profile by the distribution function of the random dissolution time of a drug molecule, which generalizes the classical first order model. Methods. Instead of assuming a constant fractional dissolution rate, as in the classical model, it is considered that the fractional dissolution rate is a decreasing function of the dissolved amount controlled by the dose-solubility ratio. The differential equation derived from this assumption is solved and the distribution measures (half-dissolution time, mean dissolution time, relative dispersion of the dissolution time, dissolution time density, and fractional dissolution rate) are calculated. Finally, instead of monotonically decreasing the fractional dissolution rate, a generalization resulting in zero dissolution rate at time origin is introduced. Results. The behavior of the model is divided into two regions defined by q, the ratio of the dose to the solubility level: q &lt; 1 (complete dissolution of the dose, dissolution time) and q &gt; 1 (saturation of the solution, saturation time). The singular case q = 1 is also treated and in this situation the mean as well as the relative dispersion of the dissolution time increase to infinity. The model was successfully fitted to data (1). Conclusions. This empirical model is descriptive without detailed physical reasoning behind its derivation. According to the model, the mean dissolution time is affected by the dose- solubility ratio. Although this prediction appears to be in accordance with preliminary application, further validation based on more suitable experimental data is required.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032862166&amp;doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1018923714107&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=63df39a0e77789246ac60869ba66d0b2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ellenbroek, B.A.</author><author>Sluyter, F.</author><author>Cools, A.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of genetic and early environmental factors in determining apomorphine susceptibility</title><secondary-title>Psychopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychopharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>124-131</pages><volume>148</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s002130050033</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Rationale: There is ample evidence that rats show large individual differences in their response to dopaminergic drugs, such as apomorphine. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of genetic and (early) environmental factors in determining the adult susceptibility to apomorphine. Four experiments were performed: In experiment 1, the original selective breeding of rats for apomorphine susceptibility (leading to APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS rats) was extended and replicated in an independent group of Wistar rats. In experiment 2, APO-SUS males were cross- bred with APO-UNSUS females and vice versa. In experiment 3 APO-SUS litters were cross-fostered to APO-UNSUS mothers or infostered to unknown APO-SUS mothers and vice versa. In experiment 4 APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS rats were maternally deprived on postnatal day 9, for a single 24-h period. Methods: Adult rats were subcutaneously injected with 1.5 mg/kg apomorphine and their gnawing response was automatically recorded in a gnawing box for 45 min. Results: In experiment 1, the original breeding was extended up to generation 24, leading to a strong and consistent difference in gnawing scores. The replication experiment also succeeded in differentiating APO-SUS and APO- UNSUS. The cross breeding experiments showed that the APO-SUS/UN-SUS offspring showed gnawing scores in between the original selection lines. Cross-fostering APO-SUS with APO-UNSUS significantly reduced the gnawing response in the offspring, whereas it did not affect the gnawing score in the APO-UNSUS animals. Maternal deprivation had the opposite effect: increase in gnawing response in APO-UNSUS, with no effect in APO-SUS. Conclusion: The results show a clear-cut contribution of both genetic and early environmental factors to the susceptibility of apomorphine.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033965234&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs002130050033&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3d9443208cde8596faeb42d2690ccae1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>DeWire, S.M.</author><author>Money, E.S.</author><author>Krall, S.P.</author><author>Damania, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV): Construction of a RRV-GFP recombinant virus and development of assays to assess viral replication</title><secondary-title>Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>122-134</pages><volume>312</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0042-6822(03)00195-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) is a γ-2-herpesvirus that is closely related to Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8). Lack of an efficient culture system to grow high titers of virus, and the lack of an in vivo animal model system, has hampered the study of KSHV replication and pathogenesis. RRV is capable of replicating to high titers on fibroblasts, thus facilitating the construction of recombinant rhadinoviruses. In addition, the ability to experimentally infect naïve rhesus macaques with RRV makes it an excellent model system to study γ-herpesvirus replication. Our study describes, for the first time, the construction of a GFP-expressing RRV recombinant virus using a traditional homologous recombination strategy. We have also developed two new methods for determining viral titers of RRV including a traditional viral plaque assay and a quantitative real-time PCR assay. We have compared the replication of wild-type RRV with that of the RRV-GFP recombinant virus in one-step growth curves. We have also measured the sensitivity of RRV to a small panel of antiviral drugs. The development of both the recombination strategy and the viral quantitation assays for RRV will lay the foundation for future studies to evaluate the contribution of individual genes to viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Materials and Methods: Seven camera systems marketed for use in clinical dentistry were compared in terms of their working distances at a 1:1 reproduction ratio. Results: Each of the systems provided slides of acceptable quality for both direct view and indirect buccal mirror view when used with the customary 90-mm to 105-mm focal-length lenses and the electronic flash units appropriate for each model. Using the manufacturers' recommended settings for each exposure, some differences in the quality of the resulting slides were noted. The color slides produced by three of the camera systems were slightly underexposed, but still clinically acceptable. Conclusion: The camera systems with longer working distances, especially for the indirect buccal mirror view and when using the lateral flash, permit the photographer to position the camera with greater ease so that the slide image is an acceptable reproduction of the actual clinical view.

Only a small proportion of patients develop multiple dideoxynucleoside resistance (MDNR) mediated by the Q151M mutation. To gain insight into the factors responsible for the low frequency of selection of Q151M, we evaluated the replication capabilities of recombinant viruses carrying two possible intermediates (151L or 151K) of the Q151M mutation generated in different reverse transcriptase (RT) genetic backgrounds. The 151L and 151K mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in RTs from two patient-derived HIV-1 isolates that had either wild type (WT) Q or the Q151M (posttreatment isolate) mutation. For comparison, both mutations were also introduced in a laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain (HIV-1(HXB2)). Analysis of replication capabilities showed that both 151L and 151K were lethal in RT genetic backgrounds of the WT isolate and in HIV-1(HXB2). In contrast, 151L but not 151K allowed virus replication in RT backgrounds of the posttreatment isolate. Three mutations (V35I, S68G, and I178M) were present in the RT background of the posttreatment isolate but not in the WT isolate. Introduction of S68G in the RT of both the WT isolate and HIV-1(HXB2) partially restored replication capacity of recombinants carrying the 151L mutation. The S68G mutation alone did not confer a significant replicative disadvantage in WT viruses. Like HIV-1(151M), HIV-1(151L) RT was found to have six- to eightfold resistance to AZT-triphosphate (TP), ddA-TP, and ddC-TP, indicating an MDNR phenotype. However, HIV-1(151L) was found to be less fit than HIV-1(151M), which may explain the preferential selection of HIV-1(151M) observed in vivo. The demonstrated ability of HIV-1(151L/68G) to replicate and the associated MDNR suggest that 151L is a potential intermediate of Q151M. The dependence of HIV-1(151L) on other mutations, such as S68G, for replication may explain the low frequency of the Q151M-mediated pathway of resistance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033819048&amp;doi=10.1128%2fJVI.74.20.9339-9346.2000&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6f93129ce68f2b34003f462ecca0caf6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Wan-Ching</author><author>Rockett, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bayesian labelling of corners using a grey-level corner image model</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Conference on Image Processing</secondary-title></titles><pages>687-690</pages><volume>1</volume><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>In this paper we present a recasting of corner detection to a problem in statistical pattern recognition which we then address with a simple feedforward neural network.

To test this hypothesis, transition rates toward specialization and toward generalization were estimated using phylogenies from 15 groups of phytophagous insects. Among the groups studied, maximum-likelihood analyses showed that the forward transition rate from generalization to specialization was significantly higher than the reverse transition rate from specialization to generalization (mean ratio of forward to reverse transition rate = 1.47 using uniform branch lengths and 1.76 using Grafen branch lengths). Although phylogenetic conservatism of host-plant use is common, the results suggest that the evolution of specialization is a highly dynamic process. For example, higher transitions rates both toward and away from specialization as well as equal transition rates were inferred. Collectively, the results reveal a tendency for directional evolution toward increased specialization but also indicate that specialization does not always represent an evolutionary dead-end that strongly limits further evolution.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036695783&amp;doi=10.1111%2fj.0014-3820.2002.tb01482.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=265ce8a7236a0e94cee762f453fee916</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Milovic, V.</author><author>Teller, I.C.</author><author>Murphy, G.M.</author><author>Caspary, W.F.</author><author>Stein, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deoxycholic acid stimulates migration in colon cancer cells</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology</full-title></periodical><pages>945-949</pages><volume>13</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/00042737-200108000-00012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background Deoxycholic acid and other secondary bile acids have long been considered tumour promoters in the colon. However, their effect on cell migration, known to play an important role in colon carcinogenesis, has not been studied so far. Objective To investigate the possible effects of deoxycholic acid on colon cancer-cell migration in culture. Methods Human colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2) were seeded on basement membrane matrix. To evaluate replication-blocked cell migration, we wounded confluent monolayers of cells with a sterile scalpel, and inhibited cell replication with mitomycin C. Immediately after wounding, the cells were exposed to 0-100 µmol/l deoxycholic acid. Migration over 72 h was monitored using a phase contrast microscope. Results Replication-blocked migration was stimulated by deoxycholic acid in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximum effect at 20 µmol/l deoxycholic acid. Enhancement of migration rate was unaffected by immunoneutralization of transforming growth factor beta (a known migration-promoting peptide). However, specific inhibition of protein kinase C markedly inhibited deoxycholic acid-induced Caco-2 cell migration. Conclusion In addition to its well-established role in the enhancement of proliferation, deoxycholic acid also stimulates colon cancer-cell migration along the basement membrane matrix. The mechanism of this stimulation is likely to involve protein kinase C. Deoxycholic acid-stimulated migration might additionally contribute to the tumour-promoting effects of secondary bile acids in the colon. © 2001 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034890788&amp;doi=10.1097%2f00042737-200108000-00012&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4af4b92866f7585347b221722e1731f2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yao, E.</author><author>Schaller, H.</author><author>Tavis, J.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The duck hepatitis B virus polymerase and core proteins accumulate in different patterns from their common mRNA</title><secondary-title>Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>81-88</pages><volume>311</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0042-6822(03)00142-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Hepadnaviral reverse transcription occurs in capsids in which the core (C) protein surrounds the reverse transcriptase (P) and pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). We analyzed the accumulation patterns of duck hepatitis B virus P, C, and pgRNA in transfected LMH cells, infected primary duck hepatocytes (PDH), and infected duck liver. In all three systems, P accumulated over time in a different pattern compared with C, despite translation of both proteins from the pgRNA. Although the accumulation patterns of the proteins varied between the systems, in each case P became detectable at the same time or earlier than C and the ratio of P relative to C dropped with time. These accumulation patterns were consistent with the translation rates and half-lives of P and C. Comparing the translation rates of P and C with the pgRNA level over time revealed that translation of P and C was negatively regulated in LMH cells.

Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC) type II is associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 90% of the patients with this disorder. A significant subset of these patients is at risk to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The objective of this study was to examine whether the presence of EMC, a presumably premalignant step of lymphoproliferation, is associated with changes in the replication state of normal structural genes. Materials and Methods. The study group included three subgroups: (1) seven patients with HCV without EMC; (2) eight patients with HCV associated with EMC. 3. Seven patients with follicular lymphoma; and (3) six healthy individuals served as control group. Monocolor fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes to p53, RB-1, and 21q22 was applied to leukocytes nuclei for the evaluation of replication timing. Results. Asynchronous replication (SD) rate was similar in patients with NHL and those with HCV associated with EMC and both are significantly higher when compared to patients with HCV without EMC and to normal controls (p &lt; 0.01) for each comparison. This held true for all studied loci (21q22, RB-1, and p53). Patients infected by HCV (but without EMC) had a significantly higher rate of asynchronous pattern in comparison with healthy controls (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions. Patients with a 'premalignant' clinical condition HCV with EMC already demonstrate asynchronous type of replication which is similar to patients who already have an established malignant disease (i.e., NHL). In the future, replication may be used to assess the risk of malignant transformation in patients with 'benign' proliferation.

Each diploid teliospore, the transmission unit, is heterozygous for the mating-type locus; therefore, germination and meiosis should produce haploid sporidia of both mating types. We investigated the mating-type ratios generated by growing sporidial colonies from single reliospores collected from six populations in two regions of northern Switzerland. One-third of the teliospores produced strongly or totally biased mating-type ratios. Usually, teliospores from a single fungal collection showed bias in both directions; however, in one population a consistent bias in one direction was found. Either more rapid replication of one mating type, perhaps on account of deficiency mutations, or a head start in replication can lead to the loss of one of the mating types after several cell cycles on laboratory medium. An experiment on replication rates of sporidia with the two different mating types confirmed that differential replication could lead to mating-type bias, although the observed difference in replication rates did not correlate with mating-type biases recorded from the teliospore from which these sporidial colonies originated. Teliospore collections from which we obtained only totally biased teliospore colonies in our survey formed conjugation hyphae when suspended on leaf tissue. Therefore, we suggest that, early after germination, meiotic products of both mating types must be present, and early self-conjugation is possible. A comparison of mating-type bias from colonies isolated 4 and 24 d after teliospore germination showed a significant change in the degree of bias, indicating that bias develops over time. Mating-type bias may influence the breeding system and the probability of self compared with outcross conjugations. However, infection initiation must take place quickly, before the flowers where spores arrive fall off the plant. Therefore, processes occurring early after spore deposition may be far more important for disease production than those that develop over several cycles of replication of the haploid sporidia.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030658832&amp;doi=10.1086%2f297470&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2d10dbaff2ccbb9532231d36fbb6e7ff</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Smit, A.J.</author><author>Bouma, A.</author><author>Van Gennip, H.G.P.</author><author>De Kluijver, E.P.</author><author>Moormann, R.J.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chimeric (marker) C-strain viruses induce clinical protection against virulent classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and reduce transmission of CSFV between vaccinated pigs</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title></periodical><pages>1467-1476</pages><volume>19</volume><number>11-12</number><issue>11-12</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0264-410X(00)00347-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Two live recombinant vaccines (Flc9 and Flc11) against classical swine fever (CSF) were evaluated for their capacity to reduce transmission of virulent CSF virus (CSFV) among vaccinated pigs. In Flc9 the 5′ terminal half of the E2 gene of the C-strain, a CSFV vaccine strain, was exchanged with the homologous gene of the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) strain 5250, the Erns gene was exchanged likewise in the chimeric Flc11 virus. Both recombinant vaccines induce an antibody response in pigs that can be distinguished from that induced after a wild-type CSFV infection. Four experiments were performed to estimate the reproduction ratio R after different vaccination-challenge intervals. Each group consisted of ten pigs [specified pathogen free (SPF) pigs or conventional pigs] that were vaccinated once, intramuscularly, either with Flc9 or Flc11 virus or that were not vaccinated. Vaccinated and susceptible pigs were challenged intranasally with the virulent CSFV strain Brescia or Behring, 1, 2 or 4 weeks after vaccination. Whether contact-pigs became infected was determined using a CSFV specific E2 (Flc9) or Erns (FLc11) antibody ELISA. In the unvaccinated control groups, virus secretion started from day 2 to 4 after inoculation and all contact pigs became infected. Contact pigs became infected in the group of pigs (SPF or conventional) vaccinated once with Flc9 virus and challenged 1-, 2- or 4-weeks later. The estimates of the R in the groups challenged at 1-, 2- and 4-weeks after vaccination were 0.38, 0 and 0.75, respectively. Contact infected pigs were not detected (R = 0) in any of the groups of pigs, vaccinated with Flc11, only SPF pigs were used. In order to achieve a statistical significance of R within the vaccinated groups each of the experiments has to be repeated at least once. The R of pigs vaccinated with Flc11 virus and challenged at 1- or 2-weeks after vaccination was however significantly lower that the reproduction ratio of the unvaccinated groups (P = 0.013). The R of pigs vaccinated with Flc9 virus and challenged at 1 (conventional pigs) or 2 weeks (SPF pigs) after vaccination was significantly lower that the reproduction ratio of the unvaccinated groups (P=0.013). In conclusion, both chimeric viruses Flc9 and Flc11 provided good clinical protection against a challenge with virulent CSFV at 1 or 2 weeks after vaccination. Further experiments should be carried out to study more aspects of the efficacy of these recombinant viruses before they can be used as a marker vaccine under field circumstances. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035825105&amp;doi=10.1016%2fS0264-410X%2800%2900347-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=385810afae2882aa7d057e7fe929da8f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lapata, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acquiring lexical generalizations from corpora: A case study for diathesis alternations</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics</secondary-title></titles><pages>397-404</pages><volume>1999-June</volume><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>This paper examines the extent to which verb diathesis alternations are empirically attested in corpus data.

This approach allows description of the behavior of an unobserved population (ie, HSCs) on the basis of the behavior of observed progeny cells (ie, granulocytes and lymphocytes). The results of previous limiting-dilution, competitive-repopulation studies in 44 mice were compared with the results of simulated transplantation studies to identify parameters that led to comparable outcomes. Using this approach, we estimated that murine HSCs replicate (on average) once every 2.5 weeks and that the frequency of murine HSCs is 8 per 105 nucleated marrow cells. If it is assumed that short-term repopulating cells are distinct from HSCs, that they contribute to hemopoiesis early after transplantation, and that they are independently regulated, a frequency of 4 HSCs per 105 nucleated marrow cells also allows simulations that best approximate the observed data. When stochastic modeling and computer simulation were applied to limiting-dilution, autologous-transplantation studies in cats heterozygous for glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, different estimates of HSC replication rate (1 per 8.3-10 weeks) and frequency (6 per 107 cells) were derived. Therefore, it appears that these parameters vary inversely with increased longevity, size, or both. An implication of these data is that human HSCs may be less frequent and replicate more slowly. These findings on cell kinetics have several implications.

An alternative model, based on Grice's theory of implicature, proposes that deception involves the manipulation of information so as to generate false implicatures. McCornack's (1992; McCornack et al., 1992) studies are replicated with the inclusion of explicit checks to determine the covertness of the purported deceptive messages and to check manipulation of information-type (Quantity, Quality, Relevance, and Manner violations). None of the results are consistent with IMT predictions.

We provide evidence for a core regulation involving alternating rounds of chromosome replication and genome segregation. In contrast, multiple rounds of replication of the chromosome could occur in the absence of an intervening cell division event. Inhibition of the elongation stage of chromosome replication resulted in cell division arrest, indicating that pathways similar to checkpoint mechanisms in eukaryotes, and the SOS system of bacteria, also exist in archaea. Several antibiotics induced cell cycle arrest in the G2 stage. Analysis of the run-out kinetics of chromosome replication during the treatments allowed estimation of the minimal rate of replication fork movement in vivo to 250 bp s-1. An efficient method for the production of synchronized Sulfolobus populations by transient daunomycin treatment is presented, providing opportunities for studies of cell cycle-specific events. Possible targets for the antibiotics are discussed, including topoisomerases and protein glycosylation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035044122&amp;doi=10.1046%2fj.1365-2958.2001.02377.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=cc8db95b41e68e45dcafff38ce0f4143</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, B.</author><author>Karpen, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Centromere identity in Drosophila is not determined in vivo by replication timing</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cell Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cell Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>683-690</pages><volume>154</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1083/jcb.200103001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Centromeric chromatin is uniquely marked by the centromere-specific histone CENP-A. For assembly of CENP-A into nucleosomes to occur without competition from H3 deposition, it was proposed that centromeres are among the first or last sequences to be replicated. In this study, centromere replication in Drosophila was studied in cell lines and in larval tissues that contain minichromosomes that have structurally defined centromeres. Two different nucleotide incorporation methods were used to evaluate replication timing of chromatin containing CID, a Drosophila homologue of CENP-A. Centromeres in Drosophila cell lines were replicated throughout S phase but primarily in mid S phase. However, endogenous centromeres and X-derived minichromosome centromeres in vivo were replicated asynchronously in mid to late S phase. Minichromosomes with structurally intact centromeres were replicated in late S phase, and those in which centric and surrounding heterochromatin were partially or fully deleted were replicated earlier in mid S phase. We provide the first in vivo evidence that centromeric chromatin is replicated at different times in S phase. These studies indicate that incorporation of CID/CENP-A into newly duplicated centromeres is independent of replication timing and argue against determination of centromere identity by temporal sequestration of centromeric chromatin replication relative to bulk genomic chromatin.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035921425&amp;doi=10.1083%2fjcb.200103001&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2f33b40567174baddf1970221274ac36</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Macdougall, T.H.J.</author><author>Shattock, R.J.</author><author>Madsen, C.</author><author>Chain, B.M.</author><author>Katz, D.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of primary HIV-1 isolate replication in dendritic cells</title><secondary-title>Clinical and Experimental Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical and Experimental Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>66-71</pages><volume>127</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01715.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The potential role of dendritic cells (DC) in the immunopathology of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) disease remains controversial. This study examines replication of a panel of HIV-1 strains (both laboratory adapted and primary) within DC, in the context of the well-established monocyte-DC and monocyte-macrophage transition. Viral replication was assessed by p24 ELISA assay. All strains of HIV-1 tested replicated in DC. Only CCR5-tropic virus replicated in macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced DC maturation (as reflected in altered cell phenotype) and at the same time diminished the ability of DC to support HIV-1 replication. In contrast the presence of activated T cells, which had been fixed to prevent them acting as a site for viral replication, enhanced the ability of the DC to support viral replication, as has been reported previously for macrophages. Thus cells that are DC by phenotype, but are not activated, act as the optimum reservoir for HIV-1 replication. If this form of DC is present in peripheral tissues, this will be permissive for amplification of the in vivo viral load at sites where there are few responder cells available, and hence contribute to the persistent immunopathology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036177312&amp;doi=10.1046%2fj.1365-2249.2002.01715.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5368a23f6addebee727b7c9a16656387</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yamaguchi, M.</author><author>Teraji, T.</author><author>Ohsawa, K.</author><author>Uchiyama, T.</author><author>Motomura, H.</author><author>Murakami, Y.</author><author>Ohyama, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Color image reproduction based on the multispectral and multiprimary imaging: Experimental evaluation</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>15-26</pages><volume>4663</volume><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.453003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Multispectral imaging is significant technology for the acquisition and display of accurate color information. Natural color reproduction under arbitrary illumination becomes possible using spectral information of both image and illumination light. In addition, multiprimary color display, i.e., using more than three primary colors, has been also developed for the reproduction of expanded color gamut, and for discounting observer metamerism. In this paper, we present the concept for the multispectral data interchange for natural color reproduction, and the experimental results using 16-band multispectral camera and 6-primary color display. In the experiment, the accuracy of color reproduction is evaluated in CIE ΔEa*b* for both image capture and display systems. The average and maximum ΔEa*b* = 1.0 and 2.1 in 16-band multispectral camera system, using Macbeth 24 color patches. In the six-primary color projection display, average and maximum ΔEa*b* = 1.3 and 2.7 with 30 test colors inside the display gamut. Moreover, the color reproduction results with different spectral distributions but same CIE tristimulus value are visually compared, and it is confirmed that the 6-primary display gives improved agreement between the original and reproduced colors. © 2002 SPIE. · 0277-786X/02/$15.00.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036404798&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.453003&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bae29ac2c7aea7d7bbdccf186c273f71</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Bishnu, P.</author><author>Hoffman, M.A.</author><author>Choudhary, S.</author><author>Huntley, C.C.</author><author>Banerjee, A.K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the P protein of human parainfluenza virus type 3 in transcription and replication</title><secondary-title>Journal of Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>5886-5895</pages><volume>74</volume><number>13</number><issue>13</issue><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JVI.74.13.5886-5895.2000</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The phosphoproteins (P proteins) of paramyxoviruses play a central role in transcription and replication of the viruses by forming the RNA polymerase complex L-P and encapsidation complex (N-P) with nucleocapsid protein (N) and binding to N protein-encapsidated genome RNA template (N-RNA template). We have analyzed the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) P protein and deletion mutants thereof in an in vitro transcription and in vivo replication system. The in vitro system utilizes purified N-RNA template and cell extract containing L and P proteins coexpressed via plasmids using a recombinant vaccinia virus expression system. The in vivo system takes advantage of minigenome replication, which measures luciferase reporter gene expression from HPIV3 minigenomes by viral proteins in a recombinant vaccinia virus expression system. These studies revealed that the C-terminal 20-amino-acid region of P is absolutely required for transcription in vitro and luciferase expression in vivo, suggesting its critical role in viral RNA synthesis. The N-terminal 40-amino-acid region, on the other hand, is essential for luciferase expression but dispensable for transcription in vitro. Consistent with these findings, the C-terminal domain is required for binding of P protein to the N-RNA template involved in both transcription and replication, whereas the N-terminal domain is required for the formation of soluble N-P complex involved in encapsidation of nascent RNA chains during replication. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that the P protein forms a stable homooligomer (perhaps a trimer) that is present in L-P and N-P complexes in the higher oligomeric forms (at least a pentamer). Interestingly, coexpression of a large excess of N- or C-terminally deleted P with wild-type P had no effect on minigenome replication in vivo, notwithstanding the formation of heterooligomeric complexes. These data indicate that P protein with a deleted terminal domain can function normally within the P heterooligomeric complex to carry out transcription and replication in vivo.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0342757599&amp;doi=10.1128%2fJVI.74.13.5886-5895.2000&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=63a56e2dce896e41a58a4f49bc96b2d7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Duan, D.W.</author><author>O'Brien, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Peer-mediated social-skills training and generalization in group homes</title><secondary-title>Behavioral Interventions</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Behavioral Interventions</full-title></periodical><pages>235-247</pages><volume>13</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/(SICI)1099-078X(199811)13:4&lt;235::AID-BIN24&gt;3.0.CO;2-M</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A multiple baseline across subjects design was used to evaluate generalization effects of a peer-tutoring procedure to teach social skills for individuals with developmental disabilities.

This study examined the influence of these aberrations on general gene replication. The study group included three subgroups: (1) 15 CLL patients, (2) 4 CLL patients with trisomy 12, (3) 3 CLL patients with deletions in 13q14. Five healthy individuals served as a control group. Monocolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes for c-myc, HER-2/neu, and p53 was applied to lymphocyte nuclei for the evaluation of replication timing. Asynchronous replication (SD) rate was significantly higher in all CLL patients (P &lt; 0.01) when compared to the control group and was even higher in the group of CLL patients with trisomy 12 and 13q14 deletion (P &lt; 0.01). The asynchrony rate was significantly higher in cells with trisomy 12 for all three probes analyzed, compared to 'healthy' cells in the same patients (P &lt; 0.001). To conclude, in CLL patients with a chromosomal aberration such as trisomy 12 and 13q14 deletion we were able to demonstrate a high rate of asynchrony of replication. The high correlation between cells with trisomy 12 and SD pattern could reflect direct influence of the aberration on gene replication and cell cycle control.

Because intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility is highly relevant for application of DNA-microarray analysis in functional genomics and metabolic engineering, we designed a set of experiments to specifically address this issue. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D was grown under defined conditions in glucose-limited chemostats, followed by transcriptome analysis with Affymetrix Gene-Chip arrays. In each of the laboratories, three independent replicate cultures were grown aerobically as well as anaerobically. Although variations introduced by in vitro handling steps were small and unbiased, greater variation from replicate cultures underscored that, to obtain reliable information, experimental replication is essential. Under aerobic conditions, 86% of the most highly expressed yeast genes showed an average intralaboratory coefficient of variation of 0.23. This is significantly lower than previously reported for shake-flask-culture transcriptome analyses and probably reflects the strict control of growth conditions in chemostats. Using the triplicate data sets and appropriate statistical analysis, the change calls from anaerobic versus aerobic comparisons yielded an over 95% agreement between the laboratories for transcripts that changed by over 2-fold, leaving only a small fraction of genes that exhibited laboratory bias.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037020260&amp;doi=10.1074%2fjbc.M204490200&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5de1d924883f84d4733234baadedbfdc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mercader, M.</author><author>Nickoloff, B.J.</author><author>Foreman, K.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Induction of human immunodeficiency virus 1 replication by human herpesvirus 8</title><secondary-title>Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>785-789</pages><volume>125</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Background. - Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals are commonly infected with herpesviruses, including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8, also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [KSHV]). Previous studies have demonstrated that coinfection with herpesviruses can modulate HIV-1 replication. This can occur either through direct interaction between the 2 viruses or through secondary effects resulting from the release of cellular factors in response to infection. Objective. - To investigate HIV-1 replication in the presence and absence of HHV-8. Design and Methods. - HIV-1 replication was analyzed following culture of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells in the presence of HHV-8 infected B-cell lines or control, uninfected B-cell lines. To confirm and extend the results of these in vitro studies, HIV-1-infected T cells were injected into human skin transplanted onto severe combined immunodeficient mice. The human skin was also injected with purified HHV-8 or phosphate-buffered saline as a control and HIV replication measured in biopsy specimens taken 5 to 8 days later. Results and Conclusions. - The results demonstrated a significant increase in HIV-1 replication in the presence of HHV-8 in both the in vitro and in vivo model systems. Although the mechanism responsible for HHV-8 induction of HIV-1 replication remains to be identified, the results indicate that these 2 viruses may interact at the molecular level in coinfected patients, resulting in increased HIV-1 viral load.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034989525&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9d9ce3f7c4302a2497f63de65c428c5d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ishikawa, Masumi</author><author>Shimada, Hirohito</author><author>Amari, Shun-ichi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Iterative design of regularizers based on data by minimizing generalization errors</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks</secondary-title></titles><pages>3-8</pages><volume>1</volume><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The difficulties in the theoretical evaluation of generalization errors were solved by iteratively estimating the parameters and generalization errors from data.

Overall, no significant harvest effects were found on the ground beetle community except for a significantly higher abundance of the open habitat species P. assimilis in clear-cuts than in uncut control forests. Our results thus do not support suggestions of an increase in diversity following clear-cutting, but are consistent with previous findings regarding increased abundances of open habitat species and no changes in abundance of forest generalists in clear-cuts. In general, the carabid community in the selection loggings resembled that in the uncut control forest, indicating a low effect of this harvesting method. Based on our analysis, we suggest that future studies of forestry impacts on invertebrates attempt to increase the number of sites evaluated rather than increase the number of samples from a given area.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0040649371&amp;doi=10.33338%2fef.83917&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bb6b44c9b9964efc00950cb54c42376e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tao, S.</author><author>Chun-Yan, Z.</author><author>Fu-Tian, L.</author><author>Kun-Gai, S.</author><author>Shang-Yu, L.</author><author>Yi-Guang, W.</author><author>Wen-Zao, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Study on perinatal toxicity of shengjimycin in mice</title><secondary-title>Chinese Journal of Antibiotics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese Journal of Antibiotics</full-title></periodical><pages>49-51</pages><volume>26</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Perinatal female mice were orally administered with shengjimycin at doses of 20 and 500mg/kg. 0.5% CMC was used as negative control.

The main objects of this study were to quantify sexual reproduction and estimate sexual reproductive output of this hydroid. Sexual reproduction occurred from mid-October to mid-December 1991 along the Spanish Mediterranean coast. During this period, male and female colonies formed gonangia. Four oocytes mature in each female gonangium, and embryonic development starts probably after internal fertilization occurs. Planulae complete their development within a mucus sheath attached to the top of the gonotheca (acrocyst). Eight successive gonangia with a life-span of ≃ 1 wk each were formed over a 2 mo period. The fertile period was characterized by high initial production of gonangia followed by a progressive decline resulting from a decrease both in the number of fertile colonies and in the gonangia density of fertile colonies. Annual production was estimated at ≃ 42 000 gonangia m- 2, representing 83 000 oocytes m-2. The high fertilization rates observed (77 to 100%) yielded a minimum production of 64 000 planulae m- 2. Reproduction in C. everta is characterized by: (1) a high number of larvae produced m-2; (2) formation and gradual release of larvae throughout the sexual reproduction period; (3) direct formation of planulae with no intermediate medusa stage; (4) low dispersive ability of the planula. All these mechanisms are part of a reproductive strategy designed to ensure the permanence of the population in its habitat.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029664231&amp;doi=10.1007%2fBF00346317&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=94016fa2d2a2241b1785dbeb2dbb45ae</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Okuhara, K.</author><author>Ohta, K.</author><author>Seo, H.</author><author>Shioda, M.</author><author>Yamada, T.</author><author>Tanaka, Y.</author><author>Dohmae, N.</author><author>Seyama, Y.</author><author>Shibata, T.</author><author>Murofushi, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A DNA unwinding factor involved in DNA replication in cell-free extracts of Xenopus eggs</title><secondary-title>Current Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>341-351</pages><volume>9</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0960-9822(99)80160-2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Alteration of chromatin structure is a key step in various aspects of DNA metabolism. DNA unwinding factors such as the high mobility group (HMG) proteins are thought to play a general role in controlling chromatin structure and a specific role in controlling DNA replication. For instance, in the in vitro simian virus 40 replication system, minichromosomes containing HMG-17 replicate more efficiently than those without it, suggesting that HMG-17 enhances the rate of replication of a chromatin template by unfolding the higher-order chromatin structure. At present, however, only limited data suggest an involvement of DNA unwinding factors in DNA replication. Results: We purified from Xenopus eggs a novel heterodimeric factor, termed DNA unwinding factor (DUF), that consists of 87 kDa and 140 kDa polypeptides; DUF unwinds closed-circular duplex DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I, but it does not possess a DNA gyrase activity: it does not introduce negative supercoils into DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. Cloning and sequencing of the cDNAs encoding the two polypeptides revealed that the 87 kDa polypeptide is homologous to a mammalian HMG protein, T160/structure-specific recognition protein. The 140 kDa polypeptide is homologous to yeast Cdc68, a protein that controls the expression of several genes during the G1 phase of the cell cycle by modulating chromatin structure. Immunodepletion of DUF from Xenopus egg extracts drastically reduced the ability of the extract to replicate exogenously added sperm chromatin or plasmid DNA. Conclusions: We propose that DUF plays a role-in DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033535573&amp;doi=10.1016%2fS0960-9822%2899%2980160-2&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=007adec34b7267357d82642619eef5e9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morrisette, M.L.</author><author>Gierut, J.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lexical organization and phonological change in treatment</title><secondary-title>Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research</full-title></periodical><pages>143-159</pages><volume>45</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1044/1092-4388(2002/011)</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Word frequency and neighborhood density are properties of lexical organization that differentially influence spoken-word recognition.

The hypothesis was that differential generalization would be associated with a word's frequency and its neighborhood density when manipulated as input in phonological treatment. Using a multiple baseline across subjects design, 8 children (aged 3;10 to 5;4) were randomly enrolled in 1 of 4 experimental conditions targeting errored sounds in high-frequency, low-frequency, high-density, or low-density words. Dependent measures were generalization of treated sounds and untreated sounds within and across manner classes as measured during and following treatment. Results supported a hierarchy of phonological generalization by experimental condition. The clinical implications lie in planning for generalization through the input presented in treatment. Theoretically, the results demonstrate that lexical organization of words in the mental lexicon interacts with phonological structure in learning.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036162247&amp;doi=10.1044%2f1092-4388%282002%2f011%29&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7b28ea13bec3c45a0a7ef06ae495ac32</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bouma, A.</author><author>De Smit, A.J.</author><author>De Jong, M.C.M.</author><author>De Kluijver, E.P.</author><author>Moormann, R.J.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determination of the onset of the herd-immunity induced by the E2 sub- unit vaccine against classical swine fever virus</title><secondary-title>Vaccine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vaccine</full-title></periodical><pages>1374-1381</pages><volume>18</volume><number>14</number><issue>14</issue><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0264-410X(99)00398-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>For a recently developed E2 subunit vaccine against classical swine fever (CSF), the reduction in transmission, at different moments after vaccination, was assessed by animal experiments and statistical calculations. Two experiments were performed to estimate the reproduction ratio R. Experiment 1 consisted of three groups and experiment 2 of two groups each of 10 pigs. In four of these groups, all pigs were vaccinated intramuscularly with the vaccine. The pigs in the fifth group remained unvaccinated (control group). After treatment, half of each group was intranasally inoculated with the virulent CSFV strain Brescia. In the vaccine groups, the following vaccination-challenge intervals were applied: 14, 14, 10, and 7 days, respectively. The occurrence of (contact-) infection was determined using the E(rns) ELISA. In the 7-days interval group and in the control group, virus transmission to all contact pigs occurred, indicating R &gt; 1. Neither in the two 2-week interval groups nor in the 10-day interval group did contact- infections occur. Hence, the estimated R is less than one, which indicates that an epidemic would fade out. Therefore, the E2 subunit vaccine may be an efficacious tool in a control program during an outbreak of CSF as from 10 days after vaccination.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033957725&amp;doi=10.1016%2fS0264-410X%2899%2900398-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=71b0b8cc6e4685f98a40fb002e5a2210</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berkhout, B.</author><author>Klaver, B.</author><author>Das, A.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forced Evolution of a Regulatory RNA Helix in the HIV-1 Genome</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title></periodical><pages>940-947</pages><volume>25</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/25.5.940</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The 5′ and 3′ end of the HIV-1 RNA genome forms a repeat (R) element that encodes a double stem-loop structure (the TAR and polyA hairpins). Phylogenetic analysis of the polyA hairpin in different human and simian immunodeficiency viruses suggests that the thermodynamic stability of the helix is fine-tuned. We demonstrated previously that mutant HIV-1 genomes with a stabilized or destabilized hairpin are severely replication-impaired. In this study, we found that the mutant with a destabilized polyA hairpin structure is conditionally defective. Whereas reduced replication is measured in infections at the regular temperature (37°C), this mutant is more fit than the wild-type virus at reduced temperature (33°C). This observation of a temperature-dependent replication defect underscores that the stability of this RNA structure is critical for function. An extensive analysis of revertant viruses was performed to further improve the understanding of the critical sequence and structural features of the element under scrutiny. The virus mutants with a stabilized or destabilized hairpin were used as a starting point in multiple, independent selections for revertant viruses with compensatory mutations. Both mutants reverted to hairpins with wild-type stability along various pathways by acquisition of compensatory mutations. We identified 19 different revertant HIV-1 forms with improved replication characteristics, providing a first look at some of the peaks in the total sequence landscape that are compatible with virus replication. These experiments also highlight some general principles of RNA structure building. © 1997 Oxford University Press.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030842451&amp;doi=10.1093%2fnar%2f25.5.940&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=464543d0cadc17d8eb45a2d93f12478a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Petrie, C.S.</author><author>Walker, M.P.</author><author>O'Mahony, A.M.</author><author>Spencer, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dimensional accuracy and surface detail reproduction of two hydrophilic vinyl polysiloxane impression materials tested under dry, moist, and wet conditions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry</full-title></periodical><pages>365-372</pages><volume>90</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0022-3913(03)00515-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Statement of problem. A major limitation of vinyl polysiloxane (VPS) impression materials is their hydrophobicity. There are 2 aspects to this problem, the wettability of the polymerized impression by dental gypsum materials and the ability of the unpolymerized material to wet intraoral tissues. To address this problem, manufacturers have added surfactants and labeled the new products as hydrophilic vinyl polysiloxane. Purpose. The purpose of this investigation was to compare dimensional accuracy and surface detail reproduction of 2 hydrophilic VPS impression materials, when used under dry, moist, and wet conditions. Material and methods. A total of 102 impressions were made of stainless steel metal dies similar to those described in American Dental Association (ADA) specification 19. The dies had 2 vertical and 3 horizontal lines inscribed on their superior surfaces. Impressions were made under dry, moist, and wet conditions. Dimensional accuracy was measured by comparing the average length of the middle horizontal line in each impression to the same line on the metal die, by use of a measuring microscope with an accuracy of 0.001 mm. A 2-way analysis of variance and least significant difference post hoc test were used to compare mean dimensional changes (α=.05). Surface detail reproduction was evaluated in 2 ways: (1) by use of criteria similar to ADA specification 19 for detail reproduction, continuous replication of at least 2 of the 3 horizontal lines, and (2) by use of a method developed for this study that categorized the impressions as satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on their surface characteristics: presence of pits, voids, or roughness. Pearson χ2 (α=.05) was used to compare detail reproduction results. Results. Conditions (dry, moist, and wet) did not cause significant adverse effects on the dimensional accuracy of either material. The mean dimensional change and SD were 0.005% ± 0.002% or less. With both surface detail analyses, dry, moist, and wet conditions had a significant effect on the detail reproduction of both materials (P&lt;.05). Only under dry conditions did both impression materials continuously replicate at least 2 of the 3 horizontal lines 100% of the time. Under moist conditions, 82% of the Aquasil impressions and 100% of the Reprosil impressions were judged satisfactory, while under wet conditions, only 47% Aquasil and 11% Reprosil impressions were satisfactory. With the additional surface detail characterization, only under dry conditions were impressions produced with clinically acceptable surface quality (Aquasil 77% and Reprosil 100% satisfactory). Conclusions. Dimensional accuracy of both materials tested was well within ADA standards. Best surface detail results were obtained only under dry conditions for both materials.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141957583&amp;doi=10.1016%2fS0022-3913%2803%2900515-8&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d3ff2929f5799e06ce43f55d575bf793</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gay-Andrieu, F.</author><author>Cozon, G.J.N.</author><author>Ferrandiz, J.</author><author>Kahi, S.</author><author>Peyron, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Flow cytometric quantification of Toxoplasma Gondii cellular infection and replication</title><secondary-title>Journal of Parasitology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Parasitology</full-title></periodical><pages>545-549</pages><volume>85</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/3285793</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The invasion and replication of Toxoplasma gondii are usually analyzed through either optical microscopy or incorporation of tritiated uracil. A new method has been developed using flow cytometric analysis to examine the entry and replication of T. gondii RH strain in Saimiri brain endothelial cells. After cell fixation and permeabilization using saponin, intracellular T. gondii were labeled with a monoclonal antibody against T. gondii SAG-1 (P30; the major cell-surface antigen) followed by fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The percentage of infected cells obtained using flow cytometry correlated directly with that obtained by UV light microscopy (r = 0.97). The mean fluorescence intensity of infected cells reflects intracellular P30 and assesses intracellular replication. The distribution of fluorescence per infected cell, considered with the percentage of infected cells, also allows a qualitative analysis of replication.

In particular, the”RNA world” hypothesis equates the linear sequence of an RNA’s nucleotides with its genotype. Individual RNA molecules may fold into different 3- dimensional structures, or conformers. Each such folding of a given genotype specifies a different phenotype. These phenotypes exhibit chemical properties that may result in replication of the genotype. Each phenotype has a fitness dependingon replication rate, and so the phenotype distribution would be subject to natural selection. To model replication and extinction of prebiotic polymers, we combine computational and biological approaches. We consider a single genotype that can fold into two different phenotypes. Each phenotype’s capacity to replicate its genotype depends on abiotic and biotic factors in the physical environment, which may change as time advances. We begin with a spatially detailed, individual based model, required for accurate modelingof small populations where the variability caused by random events amongindividual replicators dominates population dynamics. For efficient modelingof large populations where mean behavior tends to dominate, we derive a corresponding mean-field model that aggregates large, well mixed populations of common phenotypes to compare its behavior to the individual based version. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29344447624&amp;doi=10.1007%2f3-540-48086-2_100&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4a318b777eca564bd90c456578e4dbbe</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lai, D.W.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring depression of elderly chinese americans: A replication study</title><secondary-title>Home Health Care Services Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Home Health Care Services Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>69-85</pages><volume>22</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1300/J027v22n02_05</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Research findings aimed at understanding depression in ethnic elderly Chinese are lacking.

In a previous paper (Goss-Custard et al. 1995), a demographic model suggested that different breeding subpopulations of a migrating shorebird, the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, that shared the same wintering area might be affected in different ways by the progressive reduction of their winter habitat. Initially, as winter habitat was removed in simulations, all subpopulations decreased in parallel. However, as habitat loss continued, the subpopulations with lower fledgling production began to be disproportionately affected. This paper explores what caused this difference in response between subpopulations. 2. A simplified version of the model was used in which two or four subpopulations wintered in one area. Two simple density-dependent functions were included, one for breeding territoriality and one for winter mortality, with density dependence starting only above a certain threshold density. Each pair that acquired a breeding territory reared a constant number of fledged young each year. 3. As winter habitat was reduced, the reduction in population size of the subpopulations with lower reproductive rates began to accelerate as soon as the point was reached when all adults were breeding. Before this point, breeding birds that had died in the winter had been replaced by non-breeders. After this point, the subpopulation reproductive output was not sufficient to replace birds dying in the winter. At the same time, winter mortality rates remained high as winter densities were sustained by birds from the other subpopulations. 4. The results suggest that, in order to detect the first effects of winter habitat loss, conservationists should pay special attention to monitoring breeding numbers in local subpopulations with below average rates of reproduction. The results also suggest that the cause of a decline in some local breeding subpopulations, when others remain stable, may need to be sought on the wintering grounds and not in the breeding localities themselves.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030727041&amp;doi=10.2307%2f2405228&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=550b610290f379a8c186afabefad7201</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Y.-L.</author><author>Liu, C.-C.</author><author>Lei, H.-Y.</author><author>Yeh, T.-M.</author><author>Lin, Y.-S.</author><author>Chen, R.M.-Y.</author><author>Liu, H.-S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Infection of five human liver cell lines by dengue-2 virus</title><secondary-title>Journal of Medical Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Medical Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>425-431</pages><volume>60</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/(SICI)1096-9071(200004)60:4&lt;425::AID-JMV10&gt;3.0.CO;2-A</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Elevated serum transaminase levels of dengue patients indicate the possible impact of dengue virus infection on liver function. To elucidate the action of dengue virus infection in liver cells, an in vitro cell line system was established that mimicked the liver status of diverse clinical patients. Briefly, four hepatoma cell lines (HA22T, Huh7, Hep3B, and PLC) and one nonmalignant hepatocyte cell line (Chang liver) were included, representing various levels of tumorigenicity and differentiation. Our data showed that in these five cell lines, dengue-2 virus attached to each cell type equally well; however, this virus had higher replication rates and levels of virion production in differentiated Huh7, PLC, Hep3B, and Chang liver cells. Likewise, a lower replication rate was observed in the de-differentiated HA22T cells. Differentiation-related factors seem to play an important role in dengue virus replication. Further study showed that sodium butyrate (NAB, a differentiation inducer) treatment enhanced dengue virus replication in HA22T cells. Moreover, we found that the severity of morphologic aberration and the increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels correlated with the virus replication rate in the four infected hepatoma cells. In conclusion, we showed that dengue virus can infect diverse liver cells with differing replication efficiency, which causes cytopathic effects (CPEs) of diverse severity. Among the CPEs, the increased AST levels correlated with the clinical results from 24 dengue fever patients, who showed increased AST levels at the onset of fever. In summary, we find that dengue-2 virus replicates actively and causes severe CPEs in differentiated hepatoma cells. Factors related to differentiation as well as tumorigenicity seem to play critical roles, though the mechanisms of action remain unclear.

Although the recent structural studies on polymerases have brought new insights on polymerase fidelity, the role of DNA sequence and structure is less well understood. Here, the analysis of the crystal structures of hotspots for polymerase slippage including (CA)(n) and (A)n tracts in different intermolecular contexts reveals that, in the B-form, these sequences share common structural alterations which may explain the high rate of replication errors. In particular, a two-faced 'Janus-like' structure with shifted base-pairs in the major groove but an apparent normal geometry in the minor groove constitutes a molecular decoy specifically suitable to mislead the polymerases. A model of the rat polymerase β bound to this structure suggests that an altered conformation of the nascent template-primer duplex can interfere with correct nucleotide incorporation by affecting the geometry of the active site and breaking the rules of base-pairing, while at the same time escaping enzymatic mechanisms of error discrimination which scan for the correct geometry of the minor groove. In contrast, by showing that the A-form greatly attenuates the sequence-dependent structural alterations in hotspots, this study suggests that the A-conformation of the nascent template-primer duplex at the vicinity of the polymerase active site will contribute to fidelity. The A-form may play the role of a structural buffer which preserves the correct geometry of the active site for all sequences. The detailed comparison of the conformation of the nascent template-primer duplex in the available crystal structures of DNA polymerase-DNA complexes shows that polymerase β, the least accurate enzyme, is unique in binding to a B-DNA duplex even close to its active site. This model leads to several predictions which are discussed in the light of published experimental data.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033527667&amp;doi=10.1006%2fjmbi.1999.3199&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=00b85f7efeaa5d6f66025adfad03ac20</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goebl, W.</author><author>Bresin, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measurement and reproduction accuracy of computer-controlled grand pianos</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</full-title></periodical><pages>2273-2283</pages><volume>114</volume><number>4 I</number><issue>4 I</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1121/1.1605387</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The recording and reproducing capabilities of a Yamaha Disklavier grand piano and a Bösendorfer SE290 computer-controlled grand piano were tested, with the goal of examining their reliability for performance research. An experimental setup consisting of accelerometers and a calibrated microphone was used to capture key and hammer movements, as well as the acoustic signal. Five selected keys were played by pianists with two types of touch ("staccato" and "legato"). Timing and dynamic differences between the original performance, the corresponding MIDI file recorded by the computer-controlled pianos, and its reproduction were analyzed. The two devices performed quite differently with respect to timing and dynamic accuracy. The Disklavier's onset capturing was slightly more precise (± 10 ms) than its reproduction (-20 to +30 ms); the Bösendorfer performed generally better, but its timing accuracy was slightly less precise for recording (-10 to 3 ms) than for reproduction (±2 ms). Both devices exhibited a systematic (linear) error in recording over time. In the dynamic dimension, the Bösendorfer showed higher consistency over the whole dynamic range, while the Disklavier performed well only in a wide middle range.

It is the most common parasitoid of the pepper weevil, Anthonomus eugenii Cano, in the United States, Mexico, and elsewhere, and was introduced from Guatemala to Hawaii for control of this pest. Studies were conducted to assess effects of temperature and host on life history parameters of C. hunteri as a step toward eventual mass rearing and inoculative release for pepper weevil control. Oviposition, postovipostion period and adult longevity were shorter at 30°C than at 20 or 25°C. Mean number of eggs oviposited per female was greater at the lower temperatures than at the highest temperature. Duration of all development stages was shorter at 30°C than at 20 and 25°C. Developmental period of C. hunteri was longer and adult longevity was shorter on boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis Boheman, than any other host. Female wasps laid most eggs on the cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.), larvae. Transferring of C. hunteri reared on C. maculatus to pepper weevil or boll weevil caused a reduction in the mean number of eggs/female. Age-specific life tables and age-specific fecundity for C. hunteri were analyzed using three constant temperature regimes and five sources of host. These tables were used to calculate the innate capacity of natural increase (rm), the finite rate of increase (λ), the mean generation time (T), the net reproduction rate (Ro), and the gross rate of reproduction. The results indicate that C. hunteri populations are capable of increasing in all of the environmental conditions tested in the current study. The optimum temperature for population increase for C. hunteri is 25°C. With respect to host suitability, greater numbers of C. hunteri female progeny were produced when this parasitoid was reared constantly and invariably on C. maculatus larvae than on any other host.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036557343&amp;doi=10.1603%2f0046-225X-31.2.354&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9b4f5a89c6c6c799cd14905ebaa5ce5f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Movassat, J.</author><author>Portha, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Beta-cell growth in the neonatal Goto-Kakisaki rat and regeneration after treatment with streptozotocin at birth</title><secondary-title>Diabetologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Diabetologia</full-title></periodical><pages>1098-1106</pages><volume>42</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s001250051277</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aims/hypothesis. In the Goto-Kakisaki rat, a genetic model of non- insulin dependent diabetes, we have recently reported that as early as fetal age, there is a restriction of the beta-cell mass which is maintained in the adult animal and is detectable before the onset of hyperglycaemia. It is therefore important to investigate the beta-cell growth potential in young Goto-Kakisaki rats. Methods. We have studied in 4 and 7-day-old Goto-Kakisaki neonates: 1. the in vivo replication rate of the beta cell; 2. the occurrence of beta-cell apoptosis; 3. the effectiveness of beta-cell regeneration after damage caused by neonatal treatment with streptozotocin. Results. The replication rate in vivo of beta cells and the beta-cell apoptosis were similar in untreated Wistar and Goto-Kakisaki neonates on days 4 and 7 whereas the total beta-cell masses were reduced to 50% in the Goto-Kakisaki groups. Treatment with streptozotocin reduced the total beta-cell mass to the same extent in both Wistar and Goto-Kakisaki rats on day 4 compared with the corresponding normal values in Wistar and Goto-Kakisaki neonates. From day 4 to day 7, spontaneous beta-cell regeneration was manifest in both groups. Compared with the Wistar streptozotocin group, the net value of the beta-cell mass added during this period was more limited in the Goto-Kakisaki streptozotocin group, despite the replication activity of the residual beta cells being increased in this group to the same extent as in the Wistar streptozotocin group. Conclusion/interpretation. We therefore suggest: 1. that the reduced beta-cell mass in the untreated neonatal Goto-Kakisaki rat does not appear to reflect a reduction in the rate of beta-cell replication or an increased beta-cell death by apoptosis but is potentially due to an impaired rate of beta-cell neogenesis, and 2. that beta-cell regeneration can be reactivated after streptozotocin insult in the neonatal Goto-Kakisaki rat, although to a lesser extent compared with that in streptozotocin-treated Wistar neonates.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032868293&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs001250051277&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a4e280db04b9fa316455a5a78c4db60f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grammatikaki, G.</author><author>Vovlas, N.</author><author>Kaltsikes, P.J.</author><author>Sonnino, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Response of potato gametoclones to infection of four root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne) species</title><secondary-title>Russian Journal of Nematology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Russian Journal of Nematology</full-title></periodical><pages>155-159</pages><volume>7</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Forty-six potato gametoclones were obtained from three anther donor genotypes (H2258, AH 78/8015.37a and F115). The response of the anther-derived clones to infection of four root-knot nematode species (Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica, M. arenaria and M. hapla) was evaluated in a glasshouse experiment. Nematode reproduction rates on different gametoclones was estimated by evaluating egg-masses and galling index for each nematode species. In resistant gametoclones, examined microscopically 21 and 60 days after inoculation, infection sites were absent, or when present exhibited necrotic tissues and giant cells, but were undersized resulting in suppression of nematode development. In the roots of susceptible gametoclones, the nematode completed its development and the egg-laying females fed on well developed giant cells that had numerous hypertrophied nuclei and granulated cytoplasm. Thirteen anther-derived lines (28%) were resistant to at least one species of root-knot nematode. The resistance to root-knot nematodes was retained through the anther culture process, even when the ploidy level was reduced, indicating that the resistance mechanism is not influenced by the number of alleles involved. Variation for resistance among the gametoclones may be explained by the induction of de novo variability during the regeneration process.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0347081739&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a2192a2f466cba99afa830ceacfa10df</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paoloni-Giacobino, A.</author><author>Rossier, C.</author><author>Papasavvas, M.P.</author><author>Antonarakis, S.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Frequency of replication/transcription errors in (A)/(T) runs of human genes</title><secondary-title>Human Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>40-47</pages><volume>109</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s004390100541</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To estimate the error rate of the gene expression machinery and its possible age-related increase, we compared the occurrence of polymerase errors during replication and transcription in (A)/(T) runs, in DNA and RNA of young and old individuals and of early- and late-passage cultured fibroblasts. We analyzed three human genes: TPRD, TGFBR2, and ATRX containing stretches of (A)8, (A)10, and (T)13, respectively. The error rate was determined by sequencing 100 cloned PCR or RT-PCR fragments from each DNA and RNA sample. The error rates in replication and transcription increased with the stretch length. The pooled error rates for genomic DNA were: TPRD (A)8, TGFBR2 (A)10, and ATRX (T)13: 1%±0.41, 15.8%±1.3, and 31.3%±2.9, while those for RNA were: 3.8%±0.5, 19.3%±2.1, and 54.3%±1.8, respectively. The deletions of one nucleotide were the most frequent errors. In the replication analysis, a significant difference was found in old versus young individuals for the ATRX (T)13. In the transcription analysis, significantly higher error rates were obtained in old versus young individuals for the TPRD (A)8 and TGFBR2 (A)10. For these genes, the error rate in RNA isolated from fibroblasts was significantly higher than that in blood. The data show a trend of age-related increase in replication/transcription errors; however further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis, since the sample size is small. This imperfect fidelity of the gene expression process may explain the evolutionary disadvantage of nucleotide repeats within coding sequences, and that these repeats are targets for mutations in human diseases.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034911001&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs004390100541&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ba9f30c5079e140a7b50fc98e407149d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Peter C.Y.</author><author>Mills, James K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neural network generalization and system sensitivity in feedback control systems</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control - Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><pages>233-238</pages><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>In this article, anew framework for quantifying and analyzing the generalization ability of neural networks in control systems is presented. Rigorous definitions to quantify the generalization ability of a neural network in the context of system control are given. Utilizing these definitions, it is proved that a successfully trained neural network always generalize `well' to some extent. This dual property of a trained neural network provides further justification for neuro-control approaches, because the added benefit of generalization is now analytically assured. In addition, a method for estimating the extent to which a trained neural network will generalize is presented. The results of this work provide new tools for performance analysis of neural-control systems, and represents a first step towards a rigorous framework for performance-oriented analysis and synthesis of neural networks for control.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030679380&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d5ce00c718ac7e3aa2e544e90c91cc27</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, X.</author><author>Srivastava, A.</author><author>Wang, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intrinsic generalization analysis of low dimensional representations</title><secondary-title>Neural Networks</secondary-title></titles><pages>537-545</pages><volume>16</volume><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0893-6080(03)00089-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Low dimensional representations of images impose equivalence relations in the image space; the induced equivalence class of an image is named as its intrinsic generalization. The intrinsic generalization of a representation provides a novel way to measure its generalization and leads to more fundamental insights than the commonly used recognition performance, which is heavily influenced by the choice of training and test data. We demonstrate the limitations of linear subspace representations by sampling their intrinsic generalization, and propose a nonlinear representation that overcomes these limitations. The proposed representation projects images nonlinearly into the marginal densities of their filter responses, followed by linear projections of the marginals. We use experiments on large datasets to show that the representations that have better intrinsic generalization also lead to better recognition performance. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In spite of week-to-week fluctuations, the population density for each of two common European Daphnia species was found to be remarkably similar within single lakes (from station to station on a single date, and from date to date at a single station) as well as from lake to lake, regardless of trophic state. All lakes on all dates revealed densities in the range 10-50 ind 1-1 for the smaller-bodied D. cucullata and 1-5 ind 1-1 for the larger-bodied D. hyalina, in spite of different intensity of reproduction resulting from different food levels (chlorophyll a between 0.2 and 4.2 μg/l). It can be asserted that the population density of each species remains far below the carrying capacity of the habitat K, and does not depend on food levels, which merely set the rate of population increase, while the population density reflects the species' vulnerability to predation by planktivorous fish. The reactive distance (the distance over which a foraging fish can see its prey) in 1+ roach, a dominant planktivore in the lakes studied, has been found to be twice as great for D. hyalina as for D. cucullata, whatever the light intensity. The relative reactive field volume was therefore an order of magnitude greater for the former than for the latter, showing that the densities of the two prey species would be assessed by a foraging roach as equal when, in reality, they differed by an order of magnitude, as they do in various lakes and in various seasons. The first of the two conclusions is that whatever the growth and reproduction in a population of a cladoceran such as Daphnia, its density would be fixed by mortality induced by fish predation. The second would be, that the difference between the bottom-up and top-down effects in freshwater is more than merely the upward or downward direction along the food web, since the bottom-up effects are about the flow control (the rate of net production, individual growth rate, rate of reproduction) and the top-down about the standing-crop control (biomass, individual body size, population density level).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035026791&amp;doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1017590207759&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=13d3fcfaef065e5a4166c09d75cd800e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCrae, R.R.</author><author>Zonderman, A.B.</author><author>Costa Jr., P.T.</author><author>Bond, M.H.</author><author>Paunonen, S.V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating Replicability of Factors in the Revised NEO Personality Inventory: Confirmatory Factor Analysis Versus Procrustes Rotation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>552-566</pages><volume>70</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.552</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Despite the empirical robustness of the 5-factor model of personality, recent confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) of NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) data suggest they do not fit the hypothesized model.

In typically developing children, this skill appears around age 4 years (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, &amp; Frith, 1985), but it is delayed or absent in children with autism. In the present study, video modeling was used to teach perspective taking to three children with autism. A multiple-baseline design across children and within child across tasks was used to assess learning. Generalization across untrained similar stimuli was also assessed. Video modeling was a fast and effective tool for teaching perspective-taking tasks to children with autism, resulting in both stimulus and response generalization. These results concurred with previous research that perspective taking can be taught. Unlike other studies, however, wider ranges of generalization were found. © 2003, Sage Publications.

Detailed investigation of V. cholerae interactions with its host and with other organisms in the environment suggests that cholera dynamics is much more complex than previously thought. Here, I formulate a mathematical model of cholera epidemiology that incorporates an environmental reservoir of V. cholerae. The objective is to explore the role of the aquatic reservoir on the persistence of endemic cholera as well as to define minimum conditions for the development of epidemic and endemic cholera. Results: The reproduction rate of cholera in a community is defined by the product of social and environmental factors. The importance of the aquatic reservoir depends on the sanitary conditions of the community. Seasonal variations of contact rates force a cyclical pattern of cholera outbreaks, as observed in some cholera-endemic communities. Conclusions: Further development on cholera modeling requires a better understanding of V. cholerae ecology and epidemiology. We need estimates of the prevalence of V. cholerae infection in endemic populations as well as a better description of the relationship between dose and virulence. © 2001 Codeço, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2942619997&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1471-2334-1-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4d45f94380d704b0c7c18c28780795bf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Breckenridge, J.N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validating cluster analysis: Consistent replication and symmetry</title><secondary-title>Multivariate Behavioral Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Multivariate Behavioral Research</full-title></periodical><pages>261-285</pages><volume>35</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1207/S15327906MBR3502_5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Two simulation studies evaluated a cross-validation approach for cluster analyses (CA).

Estimated annual survival rates were 0.946 ± 0.026 for adult females, 0.931 ± 0.038 for subadult females, 0.944 ± 0.039 for yearlings, and 0.867 ± 0.050 for cubs (rates for cubs and yearlings represented both sexes). The estimated annual reproduction rate and age at first parturition were 0.422 ± 0.042 female cubs per female and 6.44 ± 0.45 years, respectively. We found that uncertainty in λ was mostly attributable to uncertainty in survival rates (76.7%), with subadult (47.5%) and adult (21.9%) survival contributing the largest portions. These results indicated that to reduce uncertainty in λ, further research on grizzly bears in our study area should focus on improving estimates of adult and subadult female survivorship. Other demographic variables are not as important in estimating the grizzly bear population trend in the North Fork of the Flathead River drainage.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029659944&amp;doi=10.1139%2fz96-156&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6decb686db604086a4c6ab4600b16ab2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, J.</author><author>Wiesch, D.G.</author><author>Taylor, E.W.</author><author>Meyers, D.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of replication studies, combined data analysis, and analytical methods in complex diseases</title><secondary-title>Genetic Epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><pages>S773-S778</pages><volume>17</volume><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/gepi.13701707127</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Due to genetic heterogeneity, phenocopies, incomplete penetrance, misdiagnosis, and unknown mode of inheritance, linkage studies of most complex diseases are unlikely to provide conclusive findings with unambiguously high lod scores. Typically, several marginally significant lod scores or elevated lod scores are observed in a genome-wide screen. However, it is usually difficult to differentiate these findings from false positives (type I errors). Two approaches are commonly used to guard against false positives: replication studies in independent samples and combined data analysis. In the current paper, we evaluated these two common approaches using simulated data where data from multiple groups were available and locations of disease genes were known. We found replication studies and combined data analysis performed similarly in terms of their ability to identify true and false positive linkages. Both approaches confirmed two true linkages and did not confirm any false positive linkages. The results also indicated that it is not appropriate to apply the criteria proposed for confirming significant evidence for linkage to confirm regions with only suggestive evidence for linkage. The current results support previous findings that parametric analysis using an incorrect genetic model can still identify a true linkage.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032710595&amp;doi=10.1002%2fgepi.13701707127&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=de5edec276eec78b741e0bfa8c5507f5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arias, M.</author><author>Zabaleta, J.</author><author>Rodríguez, J.I.</author><author>Rojas, M.</author><author>París, S.C.</author><author>García, L.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Failure to induce nitric oxide production by human monocyte-derived macrophages.

In the present study, the ability of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MΦ) to produce NO- in response to MΦ modulators was tested. MΦ cultured for up to nine days and stimulated for 48 with different concentrations of LPS and/or IFN-γ failed to produce significant amounts of NO2- compared to unstimulated cultures. Inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway with indomethacin did not increase NO2- production by LPS stimulated MΦ. Since human MΦ lack biopterin, needed for NO- synthesis by murine MΦ, human MΦ stimulated with LPS plus IFN-γ were additionally cultured in the presence of neopterin or biopterin. These treatments did not induce NO2- production. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment with indomethacin and neopterin or biopterin also failed to induce NO2- production. However, human MΦ, stimulated with IFN-γ LPs, produced TNF-α suggesting that the lack of increment in NO2- production was not due to an absence of response of MΦto the stimuli used. As an indirect approach to explore the NO- production, human MΦ were infected with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and simultaneously treated with the competitive inhibitor NGmonomethyl-L-arginine (NGMMA). Mycobacterial intracellular replication was measured by 3H-uracil incorporation. NGMMA did not have any effect on mycobacterial replication. These results further suggest that human MΦ do not produce NO- at least by the inducible pathway.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031262732&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=80e1f93eae70001b4f7291f4bc7cdfb9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fernandez Redondo, Mercedes</author><author>Hernandez Espinosa, Carlos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization capability of one and two hidden layers</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks</secondary-title></titles><pages>1840-1843</pages><volume>3</volume><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>In this paper we present an experimental comparison of the generalization capability of one and two hidden layers Multilayer Feedforward neural networks.

This protein is a major component of the primosome, being essential for coordinated leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. Models suggest that such DNA helicases are loaded only onto DNA at origins of replication, and that they remain with the ensuing replication fork until replication is terminated. To test this idea, we have measured the extent of processivity of the 41 protein in the context of an in vitro DNA replication system composed of eight purified proteins (the gene 43, 44/62, 45, 32, 41, 59, and 61 proteins). After starting DNA replication in the presence of these proteins, we diluted the 41 helicase enough to prevent any association of new helicase molecules and analyzed the replication products. We measured an association half-life of 11 min, revealing that the 41 protein is processive enough to finish replicating the entire 169-kilobase T4 genome at the observed replication rate of ~400 nucleotides/s. This processivity of the 41 protein does not require the 59 protein, the protein that catalyzes 41 protein assembly onto 32 protein-covered single-stranded DNA. The stability we measure for the 41 protein as part of the replication fork is greater than estimated for it alone on single-stranded DNA. We suggest that the 41 protein interacts with the polymerase holoenzyme at the fork, both stabilizing the other protein components and being stabilized thereby.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029952339&amp;doi=10.1074%2fjbc.271.28.16678&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=78b2365ca679fc903fbe6eb6f58708f2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kakizaki, S.</author><author>Takagi, H.</author><author>Horiguchi, N.</author><author>Toyoda, M.</author><author>Takayama, H.</author><author>Nagamine, T.</author><author>Mori, M.</author><author>Kato, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Iron enhances hepatitis C virus replication in cultured human hepatocytes</title><secondary-title>Liver</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Liver</full-title></periodical><pages>125-128</pages><volume>20</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1034/j.1600-0676.2000.020002125.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Iron overload in the presence of increasing concentrations of iron is one of the indicators of poor response to interferon therapy in chronic hepatitis C. In order to analyze the effect of iron on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, we measured replication in an HCV-infected cell line. Methods and Results: Cells from a non-neoplastic HCV-infected human hepatocyte line (PH5CH8) susceptible to HCV infection and supportive of HCV replication were used in this study. The replication of HCV RNA was measured by reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested PCR). PH5CH8 cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. PH5CH8 cells were incubated with 0, 1, 10, 50, and 100 μM of FeSO4 at 37°C with 5% CO2. Forty-eight hours after iron supplementation, the quantity of HCV RNA in the cells incubated in 50 and 100 CIM of FeSO4 was approximately ten times that of the cells with no iron supplementation. Similar changes were observed beginning at 12 h from supplementation with FeSO4 and continued for at least 72 h after supplementation. MTT assay indicated that iron did not have cytotoxic effects on the PH5CH8 cells. Conclusion: Iron enhances HCV replication in a hepatocyte cell line. The results suggest that iron deposition in hepatocytes could facilitate HCV infection in the liver.

This hypothesis was investigated by assessing the performance of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae), an important pest on Crucifers, on the crop plant oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Aphid growth and reproduction was measured at three controlled air temperatures and four watering regimes to induce water deficits. Plant nutritional quality (soluble nitrogen) and microclimate (leaf temperature), both important for aphid growth and reproduction, were determined. With increasing water deficit both soluble nitrogen content (% dry weight) and leaf temperature (°C) increased. At all three temperatures development time of the aphid to reproductive age was faster with increasing plant water deficits. Mean relative growth rates and the intrinsic rate of natural increase significantly increased with increasing water deficit at 15°C and 20°C, and 15°, 20° and 25°C respectively. Air temperature, leaf temperature, and soluble nitrogen are important factors on aphid growth and reproduction. The results indicate that during periods of water deficit of oilseed rape plants, aspects of the growth and reproduction of B.brassicae are increased which may result in a faster rate of increase of aphid populations on this crop.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0040916651&amp;doi=10.17660%2factahortic.1996.407.63&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=654d099945d97c69cb8675d115a615c1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tails, D.A.</author><author>Schriver, S.D.</author><author>Unthank, J.L.</author><author>Prewitt, R.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Shear stress-mediated vascular growth</title><secondary-title>FASEB Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FASEB Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>A54</pages><volume>10</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>In order to characterize in vivo shear stress-mediated vascular growth, adjacent rat mesenteric ileal and second-order arterial branches were ligated to induce blood flow increases through the immediately adjacent ileal artery.

Arterial cross-sections were cut and stained with toluidine blue for morphological assessment, and immunocytochemistry (ICC) was performed for proliferating cell nuclear antigen to measure DNA replication. Results indicate that, while arterial pressures were not altered by the ligation, ileal artery blood flow and shear stress were increased approximately 200% initially after ligation. In arteries with elevated flow, mean lumen diameter and wall area increased significantly compared to same animal control vessels: ileal artery at seven days (255 ± 12 vs. 287 ± 12 μm; 11394 ± 1137 vs. 18016 ± 2648 um2, respectively), and second-order artery at three (188 ± 8 vs. 215 ± 9 μm; 7263 ± 591 vs. 11073 ± 1254 μm2, respectively) and seven (201 ± 22 vs. 277 ± 23 μm; 5883 ± 676 vs. 12936 ± 1684 μm2, respectively) days.

My estimates were contrasted with those calculated from a previously developed bioenergetics model for yellowfin tuna T. albacares and with those from an empirical regression model based on fish morphometrics. Based on observed growth rates and metabolic costs and calculated population size structure, the models predict annual consumption: biomass (Q:B) ratios of 32.4, 19.8, and 13.4 for skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna, and albacore, respectively. The models predict that skipjack and yellowfin tuna populations allocate 20-24% of consumed energy to somatic and gonad growth, compared with only 6% for albacore. The skipjack tuna model was fairly robust with respect to most parameter estimates, but the albacore model was sensitive to parameters describing swimming speed. Empirical regression models commonly used to predict Q:B ratios produced substantially lower estimates than those given above, possibly because those models are for ectothermic fishes and cannot predict the high metabolic demands of the active, endothermic fishes that I studied. The model results indicate that the different life history strategies of these fishes are manifest in their energy budgets and that contrasts in the population consumption rates are largely due to differences in the size structure of the populations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0041312500&amp;doi=10.1577%2fT02-094&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a7c373832ff2c46dcc617df5df453caa</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Der Goot, J.A.</author><author>Koch, G.</author><author>De Jong, M.C.M.</author><author>Van Boven, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transmission dynamics of low- and high-pathogenicity A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/83 avian influenza viruses</title><secondary-title>Avian Diseases</secondary-title></titles><pages>939-941</pages><volume>47</volume><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1637/0005-2086-47.s3.939</electronic-resource-num><abstract>High-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses emerged from low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses in Pennsylvania (1983-84), Mexico (1994-95), and Italy (1999-2000). Here we focus on the question of why the HPAI virus supersedes the LPAI virus, once it has appeared during the epidemic. To study this, we used an experimental model in chickens that enabled us to estimate the reproduction ratio (R0). Using this model, we determined the R0 of the A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/21525/83 (LPAI) and of the A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83 (HPAI). Comparing the R0 of both viruses, we concluded that the R0 of the HPAI virus is significantly higher than the R0 of the LPAI.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141454778&amp;doi=10.1637%2f0005-2086-47.s3.939&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=eb1a11c5ac6fef48f24657c99ce411c3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Demeret, C.</author><author>Le Moal, M.</author><author>Yaniv, M.</author><author>Thierry, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Control of HPV 18 DNA replication by cellular and viral transcription factors</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title></periodical><pages>4777-4784</pages><volume>23</volume><number>23</number><issue>23</issue><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/23.23.4777</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Papillomavirus replication in vivo requires the interaction of the virally encoded proteins E1 and E2 with the origin of replication which is localised in the regulatory region (long control region or LCR) of the viral genome. In genital human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the origin overlaps promoter elements of early transcription. In this study, we analysed the replication of HPV18 DNA using the complete LCR containing mutations in transcription regulatory elements. We found that each of the three E2 binding sites proximal to the AT-rich sequence of the origin contributes to the replication rate of DNA, although not identically. In addition, two sequences important for early transcription, an Sp1 binding site and the TATA box, were also found to play a role in replication. In contrast, two AP1 binding sites required for the enhancer-mediated activation of early transcription did not affect the replication, while other upstream sequences in the LCR did contribute to the replication efficiency. Our results indicate that besides a core origin of replication containing an AT-rich sequence and three E2 binding sites, auxiliary elements affect HPV18 DNA replication in the context of the full length LCR, some of which are important for transcription. © 1995 Oxford University Press.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028883781&amp;doi=10.1093%2fnar%2f23.23.4777&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=23e09a9cf5532b607cb8eb59cfb6e1d7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>BouHamdan, M.</author><author>Kulkosky, J.</author><author>Duan, L.-X.</author><author>Pomerantz, R.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibition of HIV-1 replication and infectivity by expression of a fusion protein, VPR-anti-integrase single-chain variable fragment (SFv): Intravirion molecular therapies</title><secondary-title>Journal of Human Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Human Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>6-15</pages><volume>3</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Objectives: To deliver antiretroviral agents or other foreign proteins into progeny virions and evaluate their inhibitory effect on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Study Design/Methods: HIV- 1 encodes proteins in addition to gag, pol, and env, some of which are packaged into virus particles. One essential retroviral enzyme is integrase (IN), which has been used as a target for developing agents that inhibit virus replication. In previous studies, we demonstrated that intracellular expression of single-chain variable antibody fragments (SFvs), which bind to IN, results in resistance to productive HIV-1 infection in T-lymphocytic cells. Because the highly conserved accessory HIV-1 Vpr protein can be packaged within virions in quantities similar to those of the major structural proteins, this primate lentiviral protein may be used as a fusion partner to deliver antiviral agents or other foreign proteins into progeny virions. In these studies, the fusion proteins Vpr-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) and Vpr-SFv-IN have been developed. Stable transfectants expressing these fusion proteins were generated from PA317 cells and SupT1 T- lymphocytic cells and analyzed using immunofluorescence microscopy. After challenge of SupT1 cells with HIV-1, p24 antigen expression was evaluated. The incorporation of these fusion proteins were evaluated by immunoprecipitation of virions using a Vpr antibody. Results: Expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining in PA317 cells transfected with the plasmids expressing Vpr-CAT and Vpr-SFv-IN proteins. Stable transfectants expressing these fusion proteins were generated from SupT 1 T-lymphocytic cells. When challenged, HIV-1 replication, as measured by HIV-1 p24 antigen expression, was inhibited in cells expressing Vpr-SFv-IN. It was demonstrated that Vpr-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (VprCAT and Vpr-SFv-IN proteins can be efficiently packaged into the virions and that Vpr-SFv-IN also decreases the infectivity of virions into which it is encapsidated. Conclusions: An anti-integrase single-chain variable fragment moiety can be delivered into HIV-1 virions by fusing it to Vpr. Vpr-SFv-IN decreases HIV-1 production in human T- lymphocytic cells. The benefits of 'intravirion' gene therapy include immunization of target cells as well as decreasing infectivity of HIV-1 virions harboring the fusion construct. Thus, this approach to anti-HIV-1 molecular therapies has the potential to increase inhibitory, effects against HIV-1 replication and virion spread.

By using previously published data of experiments with Classical Swine Fever Virus more extensively, we obtained smaller confidence intervals than the martingale method used in the original papers. Moreover, our method allows simultaneous estimation of a reproduction ratio within pens R0w and a modified reproduction ratio between pens R'0b. Resulting estimates of R0w and R'0b for weaner pigs were 100 (95% CI 54.4-186) and 7.77 (4.68-12.9), respectively. For slaughter pigs they were 15.5 (6.20-38.7) and 3.39 (1.54-7.45), respectively. We believe, because of the smaller confidence intervals we were able to obtain, that the method presented here is better suited for use in future experiments.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036227601&amp;doi=10.1017%2fS0950268801006537&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e8815e4cd2927b9bd7e3122fdb7cc28a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hiemstra, Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linear regression versus backpropagation networks to predict: Quarterly stock market excess returns</title><secondary-title>Computational Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computational Economics</full-title></periodical><pages>67-76</pages><volume>9</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00115692</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper compares a linear model to predict quarterly stock market excess returns to several backpropagation networks. Research findings suggest that quarterly stock market returns are to some extent predictable, but only marginal attention has been paid to possible nonlinearities in the return generating process. The paper discusses input selection, elaborates on how to generate out-of-sample predictions to estimate generalization performance, motivates the choice for a particular network, examines backpropagation training, and evaluates network performance. The out-of-sample predictions are used to calculate several performance metrics, and to determine added value when applying a straightforward tactical asset allocation policy. A nonparametric test is selected to evaluate generalization behavior, and sensitivity analysis examines the selected network's qualitative behavior. Strong nonlinear effects appear to be absent, but the proposed backpropagation network generates an asset allocation policy that outperforms the linear model. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0043266837&amp;doi=10.1007%2fBF00115692&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d57501a91313a5787b55032bbf3aeead</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tokunaga, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Function of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nef gene product in virus replication</title><secondary-title>[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science</full-title></periodical><pages>345-357</pages><volume>71</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>We comparatively analyzed the replication kinetics of wild-type (wt) and nef mutant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in several CD4-positive cell lines, in order to clarify the molecular function of Nef protein. The delayed growth of nef mutant virus was observed at the initial stage of replication in all cell lines examined. This phenomenon was greatly amplified in the absence of vpu gene. In order to determine the infection stage in viral replication cycle which is specifically affected on virus replication rate in the presence of the Nef protein, we first examined the difference between wt and nef mutant viruses in the virus production rate from transfected cells, and found that the both viruses were produced with equal efficiency. This result showed that Nef protein could be dispensable for virion production. Therefore, early infection stages were focused by single-round infection assay, and the nef mutant virus was found to be much less infectious than wt virus. This indicated that the effect of Nef protein was exhibited in the early phase of a virus replication cycle, during viral adsorption to integration. By entry assay using wt and nef mutant virions, it was revealed that the Nef protein was required for efficient viral entry. These data suggest that the Nef protein might play a role in efficient incorporation of the Env protein into the virions, leading to enhanced viral infectivity.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030144865&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bac2fd04a880a9c0203f53e1db1d4c46</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerstiaensa, A.N.J.A.</author><author>Benfekihb, L.</author><author>Zouitenc, H.</author><author>Verhaerta, P.</author><author>De Loofa, A.</author><author>Schoofsa, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Led-NPF-1 stimulates ovarian development in locusts</title><secondary-title>Peptides</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Peptides</full-title></periodical><pages>39-44</pages><volume>20</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0196-9781(98)00152-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>For more than a decade, immunohistochemical results on FMRFamide related peptides (FaRP's) have been reported extensively, suggesting many possible roles for these peptides associated with behavioural and physiological events as well as reproduction.

The effect of two neuropeptide F-related peptides from the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Led-NPF-1 and Led-NPF-2 as well as the locusts myotropins, Lom- PK-1, Lom-PK-2 and Lom-SK, was screened in an ovarian development assay in the African migratory locust and the grey fleshfly, Neobellieria bullata, Led-NPF-1 (Ala-Arg-Gly-Pro-Gln-Leu-Arg-Leu-Arg-Phe-NH2) was shown to be a potent gonadostimulin in Locusta migratoria, but not in Neobellieria bullata. A minimal dose of 0.05 μg of Led-NPF-1 per animal, every 12 h, during 5 consecutive injections into 6 day old virgin females, could accelerate egg development. Higher doses of prolonged injections were demonstrated to be even more potent in the ovarian development assay. Led-NPF-2 (Ala-Pro-Ser- Leu-Arg-Leu-Arg-Phe-NH2) was far less active. The other tested peptides scored no reproducible effect what so ever on ovarian growth, in locusts, nor in flies. The gonadotropic action of a NPF-like peptide on oocyte growth implies a complex regulation of oogenesis in the locust and adds to our knowledge of insect neuroendocrinology in general. The results also suggest that a peptide of similar sequence also resides in the locust.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032923421&amp;doi=10.1016%2fS0196-9781%2898%2900152-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=df831414f40cad02c25165999970684b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barnes, L.L.B.</author><author>Harp, D.</author><author>Jung, W.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reliability generalization of scores on the spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory</title><secondary-title>Educational and Psychological Measurement</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Educational and Psychological Measurement</full-title></periodical><pages>603-618</pages><volume>62</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0013164402062004005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A reliability generalization study for Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was conducted.

Articles in medically oriented journals were shorter and somewhat less likely to mention or compute reliability than nonmedically oriented articles, perhaps due to paradigm differences.

To determine the relative contributions of the Δ67 and T69G mutations on viral fitness, we performed a series of studies of HIV replication using recombinant variants. A high-level 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT)-resistant variant containing Δ67 plus T69G/K70R/L74I/K103N/T215F/ K219Q in RT replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus (Wt). In contrast, the construct without Δ67 exhibited impaired replication (23% of growth of Wt). A competitive fitness study failed to reveal any differences in replication rates between the Δ67+T69G/K70R/L74UK103N/T215F/K219Q mutant and Wt. Evaluation of proviral DNA sequences over a 3-year period in a patient harboring the multiresistant HIV revealed that the T69G mutation emerged in the context of a D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant backbone prior to appearance of the Δ67 deletion. To assess the impact of this stepwise accumulation of mutations on viral replication, a series of recombinant variants was constructed and analyzed for replication competence. The T69G mutation was found to confer 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine resistance at the expense of fitness. Subsequently, the development of the Δ67 deletion led to a virus with improved replication and high-level AZT resistance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034469498&amp;doi=10.1128%2fJVI.74.23.10958-10964.2000&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5290e1a0f4a7580f87b5b9035fedf440</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Møller, A.P.</author><author>Lindén, M.</author><author>Soler, J.J.</author><author>Soler, M.</author><author>Moreno, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Morphological adaptations to an extreme sexual display, stone-carrying in the black wheatear, Oenanthe leucura</title><secondary-title>Behavioral Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Behavioral Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>368-375</pages><volume>6</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/beheco/6.4.368</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Males of the black wheatear (Oenanthe leucura) carry on average almost 2 kg of stones to cavities inside caves before the laying of each clutch, a display involved in postmating sexual selection as determined from female adjustment of timing and rate of reproduction to experimentally manipulated numbers of stones carried. A large wing area in relation to body mass would allow males to carry many and heavy stones. The number and mass of stones carried were inversely related to wing loading, suggesting that a large wing area has evolved as an adaptation to stone carrying. We tested this functional hypothesis in a field experiment with three treatments: (1) two primaries removed from each wing (manipulation), (2) the tips of two primaries removed from each wing (sham-manipulation), and (3) the male just captured and handled (control). The number and mass of stones carried were inversely related to original wing area, as predicted by the hypothesis, and males with initially large wing areas were better able to cope with the experimental treatment than others. These results are consistent with stone carrying being a reliable signal of maximum working ability of males during short bursts of stone carrying, and intraspecific differences in wing morphology therefore allow males to display at different levels. © 1995 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028995565&amp;doi=10.1093%2fbeheco%2f6.4.368&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f95fe607e6859e4c4fb5d68bca813860</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, E.O.</author><author>Breslau, N.</author><author>Roth, T.</author><author>Roehrs, T.</author><author>Rosenthal, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Psychometric evaluation of daytime sleepiness and nocturnal sleep onset scales in a representative community sample</title><secondary-title>Biological Psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biological Psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>764-770</pages><volume>45</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0006-3223(98)00111-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: The public health importance of daytime sleepiness as a risk factor for accidents, interpersonal problems, and decreased productivity has been recognized. However, epidemiologic research on this topic has been limited by the reliance on laboratory measures (i.e., the Multiple Sleep Latency Test - MSLT). Two scales, daytime sleepiness and nocturnal sleep onset, have been identified from the self-report Sleep-Wake Activity Inventory (SWAI) in a clinic sample and validated against the MSLT. This study evaluates the replicability of the two scales in a population sample and assesses potential thresholds in scale scores that distinguish normal from pathologic levels of daytime sleepiness and difficulty falling asleep. Methods: The sample consisted of 2181 subjects 18-45 years old in the Detroit metropolitan area. All sleep characteristic information covered the 2 weeks prior to interview. Split-half sample factor analyses were conducted to assess replicability of the results. Distribution of Scale scores and their relation to construct validity variables were used to evaluate possible thresholds. Results: A two-factor model appeared to best account for the variation among the 12 items from the SWAI. The two factors accounted for 50% of the variance in both split-half sample analyses. The revised eight-item daytime sleepiness and two-item nocturnal sleep onset scales showed good and fair internal consistency respectively across both split-half samples. There appeared to be a 'natural break' in daytime sleepiness scale scores that was associated with a substantial and consistent change in number of hours slept. No breaks appeared in nocturnal sleep onset scores. Conclusions: This study replicated the results of the clinic-based study and suggested a potentially useful diagnostic threshold for self-report excessive daytime sleepiness. Epidemiology of sleep depends on the ability to move from the laboratory to population surveys in reliable and valid ways. Development of self-report is a step in that direction.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033559048&amp;doi=10.1016%2fS0006-3223%2898%2900111-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e1c851ead011f57f2e8d8d6665f01512</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, R.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization effects in coping skills training</title><secondary-title>Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>189-204</pages><volume>21</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1123/jsep.21.3.189</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An important consideration in coping skills training is the extent to which acquired skills generalize to other life domains. For example, sport-oriented performance enhancement skills are often regarded as "life skills" that can also facilitate adaptation in other areas of life. Moreover, task-specific increases in self-efficacy produced by coping skills training could generalize to broader self-referent cognitive domains and affect global personality traits such as self-esteem and locus of control. The concept of generalization is analyzed, and factors and procedures that influence the strength and breadth of generalization effects are discussed. Several coping skills studies that address generalization effects of stress management and self-defense training are described, and the author suggests that generalization assessment should be a focal rather than incidental consideration when evaluating coping skills interventions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033240683&amp;doi=10.1123%2fjsep.21.3.189&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c1fb91e510b7a3e03f9af76b9ff16af8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, K.-H.</author><author>Kuehnle, A.R.</author><author>Sipes, B.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vitro tolerance and resistance to burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis, in Anthurium species</title><secondary-title>Euphytica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Euphytica</full-title></periodical><pages>23-28</pages><volume>103</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1018384019938</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Five Anthurium species closely related to two of the cultivated ornamentals, A. andraeanum Lind. ex Andre and A. scherzerianum Schott, and one species of breeding interest, were screened in vitro for tolerance and resistance to the nematode Radopholus similis Cobb, 1893. Adjustment of the tolerance measurement to the initial and uninoculated treatment measurement improved the screening method. Use of a nematode strain with a relatively slow reproduction rate enabled concurrent screening for tolerance and resistance to R. similis in Anthurium. Based on a lower relative symptom index, A. pittieri Engl., A. ravenii Croat and Baker, A. antioquiense Engl. and A. aripoense N. E. Br. reduce nematode damage as compared to the reference standard, 'Midori'. However, A. antioquiense and A. aripoense had higher root damage than 'Midori'. Lower nematode damage in A. pittieri and A. ravenii is positively correlated with greater plant vigor or to fewer target roots for nematode infection. A. ravenii was among the most resistant species as measured by nematode reproduction. This is followed by A. aripoense and A. pittieri. Thus, strong plant vigor, fewer target roots for nematode infection, and/or lower nematode reproduction (higher nematode resistance) resulted in lower nematode damage in A. pittieri and A. ravenii. Combining the nematode damage and nematode reproduction results, A. pittieri and A. ravenii were identified as more tolerant than the reference standard 'Midori'.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031717010&amp;doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1018384019938&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5e1ec7c4e8ab0bf6030d22ee362d113a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Montes, L.</author><author>Crozzoli, R.</author><author>Vargas, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Response of sweet potato selections to the southern root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita in Venezuela</title><secondary-title>Nematropica</secondary-title><short-title>Respuesta de selecciones de batata al nematodo agallador meloidogyne incognita en Venezuela</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nematropica</full-title></periodical><pages>113-117</pages><volume>28</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Twenty-eight Ipomoea batatas selections in the Root and Tuber Germplasm Collection of the Agronomy Department of Central University of Venezuela, Maracay, Venezuela, were evaluated for reaction to the southern root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita race 2.

At the beginning of this study she had minimal meaningful spoken output and showed little awareness of her speech despite having relatively well- preserved auditory comprehension. Her spoken output had proved resistant to earlier periods of therapy. In contrast, R.M.M.'s written output showed some ability to access orthographic information and monitoring of this modality was shown by an acute awareness of her errors. A 3-stage therapy programme is described. This was designed to improve R.M.M.'s writing of single words and to encourage use of writing as an alternative means of communication. The initial stage of therapy aimed to increase R.M.M.'s access to written word forms by use of picture stimuli. She showed significant improvement in writing treated items in response to pictures both immediately after therapy and at re-assessment 6 weeks later. Despite the acquisition of these skills, R.M.M. failed to use them in communicative contexts. A second stage of therapy replicated the results of the first and sought to facilitate R.M.M.'s functional use of her written vocabulary by asking her to write words to spoken questions. She again showed improved written naming of the treated items and could now produce written names appropriately in a questionnaire- type assessment. Generalization of this ability extended to items that had not been trained in this way. Functional use of writing in everyday communication remained absent, however. The final stage of therapy made explicit the potential links between items which R.M.M. could now write and functional messages which they might convey. She again showed significant changes in the acquisition of new vocabulary and, encouragingly, progress was also seen in her use of the strategy in functional communication. R.M.M.'s speech is almost entirely incomprehensible. It has remained unchanged for 2 years and has not responded to therapy. Relatively well-preserved auditory comprehension and good monitoring of written output allowed therapy to effectively target a small written vocabulary. Despite significant progress in the acquisition of new items, transfer of this skill to functional communication was initially absent. Further therapy which specifically targeted the impairment causing this failure was needed before functional use was seen. The potential for treating written output in cases of jargon aphasia which have been resistant to therapy for spoken language is discussed.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031746511&amp;doi=10.1080%2f136828298247767&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=aa1dce97516689ac3824c9bba26545db</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ognjanovic, S.</author><author>Tashima, L.S.</author><author>Bryant-Greenwood, G.D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor on the human fetal membranes by microarray analysis</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</full-title></periodical><pages>1187-1195</pages><volume>189</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1067/S0002-9378(03)00591-X</electronic-resource-num><abstract>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to show the effects of pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor on the genes that are expressed by the human fetal membranes. STUDY DESIGN: Explants of fetal membranes (amnion, chorion, and decidua) from three term patients were treated with 100 ng/mL recombinant human pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor for 4 hours. RNAs were hybridized to gene chips that contained &gt;18,000 known genes. One experiment was done in triplicate to assess replication. Data were analyzed to quantitate the signal intensities of each complementary DNA on the array. Confirmation of the results was carried out on tissues from nine other patients by the measurement of the proteins or quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Replication gave &lt;92.6% identical results, which showed high method reproducibility. Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor treatment caused a significant increase in 103 genes and decrease in 139 genes. Only 8 genes were up-regulated consistently and significantly in all three patients (three key inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β], four important chemokines [macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, macrophage inflammatory protein-3α, and growth-related oncogene-γ], and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2). These data were confirmed by the measurement in the media with the use of specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, and macrophage inflammatory protein-3α and by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for growth-related oncogene-γ and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2. CONCLUSION: Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor appears to be at the proximal end of the pathway to labor initiation and may link sterile distention-induced labor with that of infection-induced labor.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0242677583&amp;doi=10.1067%2fS0002-9378%2803%2900591-X&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bb54fbc729f13d31641c2226d353bf9e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giannini, E.</author><author>Botta, F.</author><author>Borro, P.</author><author>Risso, D.</author><author>Romagnoli, P.</author><author>Fasoli, A.</author><author>Mele, M.R.</author><author>Testa, E.</author><author>Mansi, C.</author><author>Savarino, V.</author><author>Testa, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio: Proposal and validation of a non-invasive parameter to predict the presence of oesophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis</title><secondary-title>Gut</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gut</full-title></periodical><pages>1200-1205</pages><volume>52</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/gut.52.8.1200</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background and aims: Cirrhotic patients frequently undergo screening endoscopy for the presence of oesophageal varices (OV). In the future, this social and medical burden will increase due to the greater number of patients with chronic liver disease and their improved survival. In this study, our aims were (1) to identify clinical, biochemical, and ultrasonographic parameters which might non-invasively predict the presence of OV in patients with liver cirrhosis; (2) to evaluate the reproducibility of the obtained results in a different, although related, further group of patients; and (3) to assess the predictiveness of the identified rules in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Methods: In the first part of the study we retrospectively evaluated the presence of OV in 145 cirrhotic patients, and in the second part we evaluated the reproducibility of the study results in a subsequent group of 121 patients. Finally, we evaluated these parameters in a subgroup of 145 patients with compensated disease. All 266 patients underwent a complete biochemical workup, upper digestive endoscopy, and ultrasonographic measurement of spleen bipolar diameter. Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio was calculated for all patients. Results: The prevalence rates of OV were 61% and 58% in the first and second groups of patients, respectively. In the first part of the study, we found that platelet count, spleen diameter, platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, and Child- Pugh class were significantly different among patients with or without OV, although the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio was the only parameter which was independently associated with the presence of OV in a multivariate analysis. A platelet count/spleen diameter ratio cut off value of 909 had 100% negative predictive value for a diagnosis of OV. This result was reproduced in the second group of patients as well as in patients with compensated disease. In a cost-benefit analysis, screening cirrhotic patients according to the "platelet count/spleen diameter ratio strategy" was far more cost effective compared with the "scope all strategy". Conclusions: The platelet count/spleen diameter ratio is the only parameter which is independently associated with the presence of OV, and its negative predictive value is reproducible. Its use is of value even in the subgroup of patients with compensated disease, and it is also cost effective.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-20244368450&amp;doi=10.1136%2fgut.52.8.1200&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ce2ff14fcbbaebdca3a1d900cfc1ae8d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Z.S.</author><author>Hall, S.M.</author><author>Haworth, S.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Proliferation and apoptosis of lung smooth muscular cells in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in neonatal pigs</title><secondary-title>Hunan yi ke da xue xue bao = Hunan yike daxue xuebao = Bulletin of Hunan Medical University</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hunan yi ke da xue xue bao = Hunan yike daxue xuebao = Bulletin of Hunan Medical University</full-title></periodical><pages>211-214</pages><volume>27</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of the proliferation and apoptosis of smooth muscular cells (SMC) in small pulmonary arteries on the pulmonary vascular remodeling in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertensive neonatal pigs. METHODS: Forty-two pigs aged from the birthday to 14 days were divided into the normal developmental group and hypoxic hypertensive group. Twenty of them were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (50.8 kPa) for 3 or 11 days to establish a pulmonary hypertension model. The proliferation and apoptosis of SMC in the pulmonary small arteries were studied with the immunohistochemiscal method and terminal transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method. RESULTS: SMC replication rates were high (5%) at birth, and followed by a burst of replication during the early period after birth. The shorter period hypoxia did not cause the increase of SMC proliferation; and the longer hypoxia induced the pulmonary vascular wall remodeling with apparent SMC proliferation. No signal of cell apoptosis in the pulmonary vascular wall was found during the neonatal period under either the normal condition or the hypoxic condition. CONCLUSION: The pulmonary resistant vascular remodeling after birth is related to SMC proliferation and SMC proliferation plays a crucial role in the formation of severe pulmonary hypertension induced by hypoxia. The role of apoptosis in the pulmonary vascular remodeling needs further research.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038481715&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ae066afb7a384f80c3f8c0fe564b4973</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Willour, V.L.</author><author>Zandi, P.P.</author><author>Huo, Y.</author><author>Diggs, T.L.</author><author>Chellis, J.L.</author><author>MacKinnon, D.F.</author><author>Simpson, S.G.</author><author>McMahon, F.J.</author><author>Potash, J.B.</author><author>Gershon, E.S.</author><author>Reich, T.</author><author>Foroud, T.</author><author>Nurnberger Jr., J.I.</author><author>DePaulo Jr., J.R.</author><author>McInnis, M.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome scan of the fifty-six bipolar pedigrees from the NIMH genetics initiative replication sample: Chromosomes 4, 7, 9, 18, 19, 20, and 21</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Medical Genetics - Neuropsychiatric Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Medical Genetics - Neuropsychiatric Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>21-27</pages><volume>121 B</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ajmg.b.20051</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The NIMH genetics initiative on bipolar disorder was established to collect uniformly ascertained bipolar pedigrees for genetic studies. In 1997, the four participating sites published a genome scan on the initial set of 97 bipolar pedigrees. Fifty-six additional bipolar pedigrees have nowbeen ascertained and evaluated. This replication pedigree set contains 354 genotyped subjects, including 139 bipolar I (BPI) subjects, five schizoaffective bipolar type SA/BP subjects, 41 bipolar II (BPII) subjects, and 43 recurrent unipolar (RUP) depression subjects. Our site has recently genotyped the replication study bipolar pedigrees using 107 microsatellite markers from chromosomes 4, 7, 9, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We are now reporting parametric and nonparametric linkage results from this effort. Multipoint nonparametric linkage analysis produced three candidate regions with allele sharing LOD scores ≥ 1.0. The linkage signal on 4q35 peaked between markers D4S3335 and D4S2390 with an allele sharing LOD score of 2.49. This finding exceeds standard criteria for suggestive linkage. Two additional loci approach suggestive linkage levels: the 4q32 finding had its maximum near marker D4S1629 with an allele sharing LOD score of 2.16, and the 20p12 finding peaked at D20S162 with an allele sharing LOD score of 1.82. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis produced similar findings. When we combined the genotype data from the original and the replication pedigree sets, 20p12 yielded a nonparametric LOD score of 2.38, which exceeds standard criteria for suggestive linkage, and a corresponding parametric HLOD score of 2.98. The combined analysis did not provide further support for linkage to 4q32 and 4q35. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0042821693&amp;doi=10.1002%2fajmg.b.20051&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7d2c154bf9cfeba43c5ba65479bb1d75</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Codeço, C.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endemic and epidemic dynamics of cholera: the role of the aquatic reservoir.</title><secondary-title>BMC infectious diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC infectious diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><volume>1</volume><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2334-1-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>BACKGROUND: In the last decades, attention to cholera epidemiology increased, as cholera epidemics became a worldwide health problem. Detailed investigation of V. cholerae interactions with its host and with other organisms in the environment suggests that cholera dynamics is much more complex than previously thought. Here, I formulate a mathematical model of cholera epidemiology that incorporates an environmental reservoir of V. cholerae. The objective is to explore the role of the aquatic reservoir on the persistence of endemic cholera as well as to define minimum conditions for the development of epidemic and endemic cholera. RESULTS: The reproduction rate of cholera in a community is defined by the product of social and environmental factors. The importance of the aquatic reservoir depends on the sanitary conditions of the community. Seasonal variations of contact rates force a cyclical pattern of cholera outbreaks, as observed in some cholera-endemic communities. CONCLUSIONS: Further development on cholera modeling requires a better understanding of V. cholerae ecology and epidemiology. We need estimates of the prevalence of V. cholerae infection in endemic populations as well as a better description of the relationship between dose and virulence.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044705152&amp;doi=10.1186%2f1471-2334-1-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=59025a969e1e46f76f04cebea572bf43</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mackiewicz, P.</author><author>Gierlik, A.</author><author>Kowalczuk, M.</author><author>Dudek, M.R.</author><author>Cebrat, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How does replication-associated mutational pressure influence amino acid composition of proteins?</title><secondary-title>Genome Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Research</full-title></periodical><pages>409-416</pages><volume>9</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>We have performed detrended DNA walks on whole prokaryotic genomes, on noncoding sequences and separately, on each position in codons of coding sequences. Our method enables us to distinguish between the mutational pressure associated with replication and the mutational pressure associated with transcription and other mechanisms that introduce asymmetry into prokaryotic chromosomes. In many prokaryotic genomes, each component of mutational pressure affects coding sequences not only in silent positions but also in positions in which changes cause amino acid substitutions in coded proteins. Asymmetry in the silent positions of codons differentiates the rate of translation of mRNA produced from leading and lagging strands. Asymmetry in the amino acid composition of proteins resulting from replication-associated mutational pressure also corresponds to leading and lagging roles of DNA strands, whereas asymmetry connected with transcription and coding function corresponds to the distance of genes from the origin or terminus of chromosome replication.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032999415&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8819a2f885731a02ce9e6ca8e22763fa</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hooke, A.M.</author><author>Sordelli, D.O.</author><author>Cerquetti, M.C.</author><author>Vogt, A.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitative determination of bacterial replication in vivo</title><secondary-title>Infection and Immunity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection and Immunity</full-title></periodical><pages>424-427</pages><volume>49</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1985</year><pub-dates><date>1985</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/iai.49.2.424-427.1985</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A new methodology which permits the quantitative measurement of absolute bacterial replication in vivo is proposed. Mice were inoculated with mixtures of temperature-sensitive mutants and parental wild types, and the changes in the ratios of the two strains were measured. The number of wild-type generations was calculated from the declining ratios over time with the formula n = log [r(0)/r(t)]log2; n is the number of generations, and r(0) and r(t) are the ratio of temperature-sensitive mutants to the parental wild type at time zero and at the times sampled throughout the experiment. The replication rate was determined by regression analysis. A mathematical argument for the formula is presented.

Only after training with a set of shirts that sampled the range of stimulus and response variation for "putting on pullover shirts" was successful gernalization observed. Results suggest that the response variations taught during general case instruction played a major role in improved performance across the nontrained shirts. Implications of the results are discussed for instruction in applied settings, and for research methodology in the analysis of generalization. © 1986.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022994398&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0270-3092%2886%2990005-6&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7dd509f329d04c3e13d451d092ac45c6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Christensen, A.P.</author><author>Sanders, M.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>HABIT REVERSAL AND DIFFERENTIAL REINFORCEMENT OF OTHER BEHAVIOUR IN THE TREATMENT OF THUMB‐SUCKING: AN ANALYSIS OF GENERALIZATION AND SIDE‐EFFECTS</title><secondary-title>Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>281-295</pages><volume>28</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1987</year><pub-dates><date>1987</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1469-7610.1987.tb00211.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract This study evaluated the generalization, maintenance, and negative side‐effects of Habit Reversal (HR) and Differential Reinforcement of Other Behaviour (DRO) in the elimination of thumb‐suking. Thirty children who sucking their thumbs or fingers excessively were randomly assigned to a HR, DRO or wait‐list control group. Observation data were collected in three observation settings. Both procedures effectively reduced thumb‐sucking in both a training setting and in two generalization settings, and initial generalization effects maintained over time. However, both procedures resulted in some temporary increases in opppsitional behaviour and produced low elimination rates. Differences between HR and DRO were not statistically significant; however parents evaluated HR somewhat more favourably than DRO. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

Replicating DNA from T-lymphoma and myelomonocyte cell lines was density labeled with bromodeoxyuridine and extracted from cells which had been fractionated into different stages of S phase by centrifugal elutriation. The replicating DNA from each fraction of S phase was separated from nonreplicating DNA on density gradients, blotted, and hybridized with 34 specific MHC probes. The earliest replication occurred in the vicinity of transcribed genes K, HAM1 and HAM2, RD, B144, D, L, T18, and T3. The temporal order of replication of groups of DNA segments suggests the location of five or six replicons within the H-2 complex, some of which appear to be either unidirectional or markedly asymmetric. The rates of replication through each of these apparent replicons appear to be similar. The TL region of the S49.1 T-lymphoma cells, which contains at least three transcribed genes, replicates earlier than the inactive TL region of WEHI-3 myelomonocytic cells. These results provide further evidence of a relationship between transcription and the initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells. The mouse MHC examined in this study is the largest chromosomal region (&gt;2,000 kb) measured for timing of replication to date.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026687886&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c98d0e2e6938bb625cd5ef2c0647f1b7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pegtel, D.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Responses of plants to Al, Mn and Fe, with particular reference to Succisa pratensis moench</title><secondary-title>Plant and Soil</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant and Soil</full-title></periodical><pages>43-55</pages><volume>93</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1986</year><pub-dates><date>1986</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF02377144</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Succisa pratensis Moench is an ecologically wide-ranging hemicryptophytic plant species. The wide ecological amplitude is at least related to edaphic factors such as wide variation in soil pH from strongly acid to alkaline, and variation in soil wetness from aerobic to anaerobic. Al and Mn are generally considered important growth-limiting factors of many acid (sub) soils, whilst both reduced Mn and Fe are soluble and many reach phytotoxic concentrations when soil is oxygen-depleted after flooding. The growth of young individuals of two populations from contrasted ecology was compared: one from a dry heath vegetation on acid podzol, and one from a waterlogged fen meadow vegetation on non-ripened raw peat with ripened top. Seedlings raised from fruits were grown on a complete nutrient solution situated in a controlled environment. Various concentrations of the microelements Al, Mn and Fe at high acidity (pH 3.8) were used separately. It appeared that both populations showed the same response curve to concentrations of the three elements. Al did not differentiate between them, while the production of the waterlogged fen meadow population was less inhibited by either Mn or Fe compared to that of the dry heath population. These results may indicate that the wide ecological amplitude of this species is partly achieved by genetic differentiation into separate populations (edaphic ecotypes) as far as Mn and Fe are concerned. The study is used to evaluate generalization from experiments on genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity as adaptive responses to contrasting habitats. © 1986 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0347138088&amp;doi=10.1007%2fBF02377144&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e5ce6eb07d938dccb513cf8104ad14de</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Woodman, D.R.</author><author>Shultz, W.W.</author><author>Woodman, K.L.</author><author>Weiss, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Growth of Rickettsia typhi in irradiated L cells enhanced by lysosomal stabilization</title><secondary-title>Infection and Immunity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection and Immunity</full-title></periodical><pages>61-67</pages><volume>23</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1979</year><pub-dates><date>1979</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/iai.23.1.61-67.1979</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The growth of some obligate intracellular parasites is contingent upon avoidance of lysosomal activation during growth in their host cells. This is accomplished by the various parasites by different mechanisms and with different degrees of efficiency. The possibility was tested that the lysosomal stabilizer cortisone acetate might protect and thus enhance the growth of Rickettsia typhi in mouse L cells irradiated 6 days earlier. Beginning 2 days before infection of the L cells with a multiplicity of 10 rickettsiae, 20 μg of cortisone per ml was added in medium 199 containing 5% fetal calf serum. This concentration of cortisone was below the cytotoxic level, as determined by viability staining, but was sufficient to significantly alter the ratios of cellular and released acid phosphatase and β-glucuronidase in uninfected and infected cells, as shown by spectrophotometric analysis. Rickettsial replication, measured by hemolytic activity at 96 h and confirmed by microscopic observations at earlier stages of infection, was increased by the cortisone. Cortisone concentrations of 10 or 40 μg/ml were less effective and cortisone was ineffective when the rickettsial multiplicity per L cell was 2 or lower. These results indicate that amounts of cortisone that increase lysosomal stabilizlation in L cells favor rickettsial multiplication when the multiplicity of infection is relatively high.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0018317821&amp;doi=10.1128%2fiai.23.1.61-67.1979&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=561bc91002dd82137a0e8b910b409993</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fichter, M.M.</author><author>Keeser, W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Behavioral treatment of an anorexic male: Experimental analysis of generalization</title><secondary-title>Behavioural Analysis and Modification</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Behavioural Analysis and Modification</full-title></periodical><pages>152-168</pages><volume>4</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1980</year><pub-dates><date>1980</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>An 18 year old anorexic male who demonstrated bizarre eating behaviors and was 30% below ideal body weight received token reinforcement contingent upon carrying out four target behaviors: attendance at meals in the dining room; reduced speed of eating; proper sequencing of dishes, and not playing with food. The tokens could be exchanged for special privileges, such as access to musical instruments or books. Using a multiple baseline design the reinforcement contingency was sequentially applied to each of the four behaviors to evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure and to determine response generalization to five concomitant variables. These generalization measures were amount of food eaten; vomiting; gross motor activity during day and during night; body weight; and a 9-item Anorexia Self-rating Scale. Results indicate that the contingency was the effective element in increasing the patient's appropriate eating behavior and that there was response generalization following the intervention for speed of eating. A statistical analysis of the time-series based on an autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) model was performed to evaluate intervention and generalization effects. Follow-up data obtained 7 months after the patient's discharge from the hospital indicated that durability was good in all target behaviors, while deterioration was observed in all concomitant variables except body weight.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0019153704&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1d45bb4744a47b9d5c1dce0a250ae023</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vieillard, V.</author><author>Lauret, E.</author><author>Maguer, V.</author><author>Jacomett, C.</author><author>Rozenbaum, W.</author><author>Gazzolo, L.</author><author>De Maeyer, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Autocrine interferon-β synthesis for gene therapy of HIV infection: Increased resistance to HIV-1 in lymphocytes from healthy and HIV-infected individuals</title><secondary-title>AIDS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AIDS</full-title></periodical><pages>1221-1228</pages><volume>9</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/00002030-199511000-00002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objective: To explore the possibility of gene therapy of HIV infection based on the multiple antiretroviral activities of interferon (IFN)-β. Design: We introduced into HIV target cells an IFN-β gene placed under an expression control ensuring a low and constitutive expression, sufficient to confer a permanent antiviral state without impeding normal cell function. Methods: We transformed, with an efficacy ranging from 20-55%, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) derived from healthy, seronegative donors, and from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals by the HMB-KbHulFNβ retroviral vector carrying the human IFN-β coding sequence driven by a fragment of the murine H-2Kb gene promoter. Results: The replication rate of the IFN-β-expressing cells was no different from that of untransformed controls during the 21-day period of in vitro observation. When IFN-β-transformed, purified CD4+ lymphocytes from healthy donors were HIV-1(LAl)-infected, virus replication was inhibited and most of the cells survived, in contrast to untransformed CD4+ cells which were all destroyed 12 days after infection. Protection of CD4+ cells from the same donors was also observed in suspensions of IFN-β-transformed total PBL that were infected with HIV-1(LAl). In IFN-β-transformed PBL from four HIV-infected donors, endogenous HIV replication was decreased and 28-69% of the CD4+ cells survived at the end of the 21 days in culture. In the untransformed control PBL suspensions, all CD4+ cells were destroyed. In long-term experiments, HIV-infected, IFN-β-transformed cell populations of the lymphocytic CEM and the promonocytic U937 line were kept in culture for 60 days, during which time they remained resistant to HIV infection. Conclusion: These results indicate that further exploration of autocrine IFN-β production for somatic cell gene therapy of HIV infection is warranted.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028886470&amp;doi=10.1097%2f00002030-199511000-00002&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1c6bd58d523284b0f7233ab6a0a5733d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foxx, R.M.</author><author>Faw, G.D.</author><author>McMorrow, M.J.</author><author>Davis, L.</author><author>Bittle, R.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replacing maladaptive speech with verbal labeling responses: A case study promoting generalized responding</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Multihandicapped Person</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Multihandicapped Person</full-title></periodical><pages>93-103</pages><volume>1</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1988</year><pub-dates><date>1988</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF01098250</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We taught a mentally handicapped student to answer five questions with verbal labels and evaluated the generalized effects of this training on his echolalia and correct responding to five untrained questions.

This follows from the finding that replication rates reported for 17 RNA species (genome length, 77-370 nucleotides) correlate with the self-interaction free energy of these self-annealed strands. Formation of double-stranded molecules during replication conversely decreased with self-interaction free energy. H-bond formation between self-complementary segments of folded RNA molecules plainly produces a potential energy barrier opposing the transition to a double-stranded, non-replicating form. Melting point temperature and resistance of RNA synthesis to elevated salt levels among three variants also increased with strand configuration free energy. Genome-based estimates of fitness in other self-replicating RNA species were therefore possible. Once a link between the kinetic parameters of replication and base sequence of these RNA species is adequately established, estimates of fitness can be dissociated from survival rates following evolution, and Darwin's fundamental precept, 'survival of the fittest', could be appraised as an experimentally testable hypothesis.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028947021&amp;doi=10.1098%2frspb.1995.0056&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8dc2f3606dd70f86c52541d7d7f958d1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liapunova, N.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Organization of Replication Units and DNA Replication in Mammalian Cells as Studied by DNA Fiber Radioautography</title><secondary-title>International Review of Cytology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Review of Cytology</full-title></periodical><pages>261-308</pages><volume>154</volume><number>C</number><issue>C</issue><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0074-7696(08)62201-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This chapter focuses on a critical view of radioautographic analysis of replicating DNA molecules, and discusses the analysis of replication units functioning during DNA replication in warm-blooded animals. Thereafter the characteristics of replicons in mammalian chromosomes, their sizes, the replication fork rate (RFR), the methods of replicon termination, and the question of the existence of a replication fork barrier (RFB) are discussed on the basis of data obtained mainly by DNA fiber radioautography (DFR). At the beginning of this chapter, the current concepts of chromosome replication are briefly reviewed. At the end, the replicon model for DNA replication in mammalian chromosomes is proposed. A complete description of replication of genomic DNA should include a full characterization of replicons, such as their sizes and number, the rate of elongation, and the method of termination. It should also include known regularities of temporal and spatial organization of chromosome duplication and the parameters of the period of DNA synthesis (S phase) in the cell cycle. Data on mammalian DNA replicons are obtained by a variety of techniques. A number of hydrodynamic methods have been successfully used to estimate the rates of replication fork movement and the sizes of replicative intermediates both in normal cells and in cells where DNA synthesis is affected by various agents. © 1994, Academic Press Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028674505&amp;doi=10.1016%2fS0074-7696%2808%2962201-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=de25d50b3b3cb67a35ae58946a02ffef</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foxx, R.M.</author><author>Faw, G.D.</author><author>McMorrow, M.J.</author><author>Kyle, M.S.</author><author>Bittle, R.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>REPLACING MALADAPTIVE SPEECH WITH VERBAL LABELING RESPONSES: AN ANALYSIS OF GENERALIZED RESPONDING</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</full-title></periodical><pages>411-417</pages><volume>21</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1988</year><pub-dates><date>1988</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1901/jaba.1988.21-411</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We taught three mentally handicapped students to answer questions with verbal labels and evaluated the generalized effects of this training on their maladaptive speech (e.g., echolalia) and correct responding to untrained questions.

In Experiment 1, 16- and 20-month-old children enacted 6 event sequences. One week later they were tested for delayed recall. At delayed testing the props used to enact one half of the events were replaced by novel, functionally equivalent props. Children in both age groups used the new props to enact the events, thereby demonstrating spontaneous generalization. Experiments 2 and 3 tested whether generalization is accomplished through forgetting of the specific details of the original event. At Session 1, 16- (Experiments 2 and 3) and 20-month-olds (Experiment 2) enacted 4 events. One week later they selected from an array of props those used to enact the events at Session 1.

Monolayers of human lung fibroblast cell lines were exposed to DNA-damaging agents (methyl methanesulfonate [MMS], methyl methanethiosulfonate [MMTS], ultraviolet light [UV], or gamma radiation [GR]) at specific intervals, before or after inoculation with low levels of HSV-1. The ability of cell monolayers to support HSV-1 replication was measured by direct plaque assay and was compared with that of untreated control samples. In this system, monolayers of different cell lines infected with identical HSV-1 strains demonstrated dissimilar levels of recovery of the infectious virus. Exposure of DNA-repair-competent cell cultures to DNA-damaging agents produced time-dependent enhanced virus replication. Treatment with agent before virus inoculation significantly (p &lt; 0.025) increased the number of plaques by 10 to 68%, compared with untreated control cultures, while treatment with agent after virus adsorption significantly increased (p&lt;0.025) the number of plaques by 7 to 15%. In a parallel series of experiments, cells deficient in DNA repair (xeroderma pigmentosum) failed to support enhanced virus replication. These results suggest that after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, fibroblasts competent in DNA repair amplify the replication of HSV-1, and that DNA-repair mechanisms that act on a variety of chromosomal lesions may be involved in the repair and biological activation of HSV-1 eenomes. © 1991, SAGE Publications.

Significant variance components were detected between non‐acclimated and acclimated cultures for cell potencies, yields and reproduction rates. The resultant variance in acclimated potencies among clones was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001), indicating that potency can be used for genetic comparisons. However, cell potency differences for a clone of G. toxicus in the acclimated vs. non‐acclimated phases can exceed genetic differences between clones. This stresses the need for a rigorous acclimation process. Caribbean isolates of G. toxicus were inherently more toxic than isolates from other areas. One Caribbean clone yielded 55 × 10−4 mu (mouse units)·cell−1 whereas clones Bermuda, the Bahamas, and Florida ranged from only 1.8 × 10−4 mu·cell−1 to a maximum of 19.8 × 10−4 mu·cell−1. Toxicity decreased with increasing latitude (r =–0.819, P &lt; 0.01), indicating that environmental differences probably influenced the potencies. A comparison of acclimated reproduction rates at four light intensities also indicated that genetic differences among clones existed. The resulting reproduction rate/light slopes overlapped, indicating that the clones may be adapted to specific light regimes. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

Design and methods: The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine (formerly BI-RG-587) was tested in combination with the other antiretroviral agents. Assays were performed on stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes infected with HIV-1. Virus replication was assessed by the release of viral p24 antigen into culture supernatants. The median-effect principle was used to assess for synergistic interactions of the combined agents. Results: Zidovudine, IFN-α 2C and CD4 immunoadhesin, when used in combination with nevirapine, synergistically inhibited HIV-1 replication in human peripheral blood lymphocytes compared with each agent used alone. Some analyses were also consistent with additive effects, but antagonism was not noted. Conclusion: These in vitro findings provide a scientific basis for future trials with similar drug combinations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027214287&amp;doi=10.1097%2f00002030-199309000-00005&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=98b390b47324d2887cf16eb5512534e0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fox, C.A.</author><author>Loo, S.</author><author>Dillin, A.</author><author>Rine, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The origin recognition complex has essential functions in transcriptional silencing and chromosomal replication</title><secondary-title>Genes and Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes and Development</full-title></periodical><pages>911-924</pages><volume>9</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gad.9.8.911</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The role of the origin recognition complex (ORC) was investigated in replication initiation and in silencing. Temperature-sensitive mutations in ORC genes caused defects in replication initiation at chromosomal origins of replication, as measured by two-dimensional (2-D) origin-mapping gels, fork migration analysis, and plasmid replication studies. These data were consistent with ORC functioning as a eukaryotic replication initiator. Some origins displayed greater replication initiation deficiencies in orc mutants than did others, revealing functional differences between origins. Alleles of ORC5 were isolated that were defective for silencing but not replication, indicating that ORC's role in silencing could be separated from its role in replication. In temperature-sensitive orc mutants arrested in mitosis, temperature-shift experiments caused a loss of silencing, indicating both that ORC had functions outside of the S phase of the cell cycle and that ORC was required for the maintenance of the silenced state.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028897908&amp;doi=10.1101%2fgad.9.8.911&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a99f6eec0aa1d6a68a34bde5bf40617a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manch-Citron, J.N.</author><author>Gennaro, M.L.</author><author>Majumder, S.</author><author>Novick, R.P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RepC is rate limiting for pT181 plasmid replication</title><secondary-title>Plasmid</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plasmid</full-title></periodical><pages>108-115</pages><volume>16</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1986</year><pub-dates><date>1986</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0147-619X(86)90069-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The effect on pT181 plasmid replication of the concentration of the plasmid-coded initiator protein, RepC, has been analyzed. In one type of experiment, plasmid replication was found to stop immediately after the addition of an inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol (Cm) to growing cultures. Chromosomal replication showed the slow turnoff that is usual for Cm inhibition. Because plasmid replication rate is determined autogenously, no host factor can be rate limiting, suggesting that the specific factor affected is Rep C. In another type of experiment, we constructed a translational fusion between the repC coding sequence and a translationally inducible Cm-acetylase gene, cat-86, using pUB110 as the carrier replicon. The fusion plasmid showed an eightfold amplification of its own copy number and a similar amplification of a co-resident pT181 plasmid upon Cm induction. The amplified plasmids did not show autocatalytic runaway replication but rather established stable elevated copy numbers, indicating the existence of a secondary level of regulation. These results suggest that RepC is rate limiting for pT181 replication and support the hypothesis that pT181 replication is regulated at the level of RepC synthesis. The nature of the secondary regulation is unknown. © 1986.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022776726&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0147-619X%2886%2990069-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a8ed2f24870a11a0700e32a7b6b903fb</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foster, R.F.</author><author>Thompson, J.M.</author><author>Kaufman, S.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A laminin substrate promotes myogenesis in rat skeletal muscle cultures: Analysis of replication and development using antidesmin and anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibodies</title><secondary-title>Developmental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Developmental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>11-20</pages><volume>122</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1987</year><pub-dates><date>1987</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0012-1606(87)90327-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cells from newborn rat hindlimb show greatly enhanced myogenicity when grown on surfaces coated with poly-l-lysine followed by laminin (PLL/Lam) instead of the collagens routinely used. Coating with poly-l-lysine (PLL) alone or with PLL followed by collagen does not enhance myogenicity. Both myogenic and nonmyogenic cells, as distinguished by a monoclonal antibody specific for desmin, attach equally well to collagen- and laminin-coated surfaces, but there is a two- to five-fold increase in the number of myogenic cells on PLL/Lam by 72 hr, followed by increased myotube formation. To determine whether this increase in myogenic cells was a consequence of a selective increase in proliferation on PLL/Lam, incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine into DNA followed by labeling with anti-BrdUrd antibody was used as an index of cell proliferation. The results indicate that desmin is expressed in replicating rat myoblasts, and that replication of myogenic cells is greatly enhanced on laminin compared to collagen. The rate of replication of nonmyogenic cells is the same on both substrates. Addition of 10 μg/ml laminin to the medium of cells seeded on PLL or collagen has no effect on myogenicity. We conclude that a laminin substrate enhances skeletal myogenesis in vitro by promoting selectively the replication of myoblasts. Cultures prepared from fetuses at 17 and 19 days gestation also show enhanced myogenicity when grown on PLL/Lam, while those from 15-day fetuses do not. Growth and development of fetal myoblasts on collagen were very poor, whereas myoblasts from the newborn rat do proliferate and differentiate on this substrate. Thus myogenic cells at different stages of fetal and neonatal development may require and respond to different extracellular environments. Myotube formation in the E63 clone of L8 rat myoblasts is inhibited by PLL/Lam. © 1987.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023234520&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0012-1606%2887%2990327-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4220fedc47b6964f62b29b95c5c0c09e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shorkey, C.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Psychological characteristics of child abusers: Speculation and the need for research</title><secondary-title>Child Abuse and Neglect</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Child Abuse and Neglect</full-title></periodical><pages>69-76</pages><volume>2</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1978</year><pub-dates><date>1978</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0145-2134(78)90008-X</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Current information related to psychological characteristics of child abusers is very limited; it does not provide adequate knowledge for the development of treatment programs with a high degree of predicted effectiveness. Much more research will help to identify psychological measures related to hypothetical characteristics of individuals who abuse children. Preference should be given to personality scales that relate to basic characteristics of abusers identified in descriptive research studies. Tests such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Thematic Apperception Test and Rorschach should be avoided because both the lengthy testing required and scoring reliability problems reduce the likelihood that other researchers would use these measures in replication studies. Current priorities for use of available resources should be shifted from training, technical assistance and program planning to emphasizing basic research that will provide fundamental knowledge related to the individual, social and situation variables involved in the problem of child abuse. © 1978.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-50849153867&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0145-2134%2878%2990008-X&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5126e5055a5988c1964510fb588cb1b7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kirtland, J.</author><author>Harris, P.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes in adipose tissue of the rat due to early undernutrition followed by rehabilitation:3.

Well-nourished rats were injected with tritiated thymidine at 15, 22, 28 or 84 d of age. At 1, 6, 11 and 16 d after injection animals from each group were killed, samples of adipose tissue were removed from two subcutanecus sites (abdominal and scapular) and separated, using collagenase (EC 3.4.24.3), into ‘fat cell’ and ‘stromal cell’ fractions. The specific (radio)activity of DNA isolated from each fraction was measured. The specific activity of DNA isolated from two ‘deep body’ sites (perirenal and epididymal) was measured only in the animals injected at 84 d of age. 2. Animals undernourished from birth up to 84 d of age were injected with tritiated thymidine at 22, 28 or 84 d of age. Animals were killed 1 and 11 d after injection, adipose tissue removed, and the specific activity of DNA measured. Other undernourished animals were rehabilitated from 84 to 107 d and injected at 91 d of age with tritiated thymidine. The animals were killed 1, 6, 11 and 16 d after injection, adipose tissue was removed from the subcutaneous and deep body sites and the specific activity of DNA determined as before. 3. In well-nourished animals fat cell replication had largely ceased by 12 weeks of age in the subcutaneous depots. There were differences between the various sites of adipose tissue regarding the period of hyperplastic growth, its timing or rate of replication or both. 4. In undernourished animals replication was slow in the subcutaneous depots compared with well-nourished animals of the same age. Rehabilitation from undernutrition stimulated replication which resulted in higher rates in all four depots examined compared with those in well-nourished animals. 5. The findings are discussed in relation to the concept of a finite period of hyperplasia for adipose tissue. © 1980, The Nutrition Society.

The study was replicated and unselected control lines were maintained. Unspotted animals quickly disappeared from the lines under increased selection, and did not reappear when selection was reversed, indicating that presence of spots is due to a major gene. Spot size behaved as a quantitative polygenic trait; realized heritability estimates were 0.47 for increased, and 0.59 for reverse selection. Reproduction, measured as mice weaned per mated pair, decreased under increased selection, but returned to near control levels under reverse selection. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in litter size at birth and in preweaning survival. It could not be attributed to the effects of inbreeding. No correlation between reproduction and parental score, however, could be demonstrated within line and generation. The reason for the negative association of reproduction with spot size was not determinable with present data. © 1979 AMRICAN GENETIC ASSOCIATION.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0018562107&amp;doi=10.1093%2foxfordjournals.jhered.a109283&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7e611d1e975f7a3f5e9b24de5a0c8278</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, T.A.</author><author>Tees, D.</author><author>Thom, D.R.</author><author>Hurt Jr., H.H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation and replication of impact damage to bicycle helmets</title><secondary-title>Accident Analysis and Prevention</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Accident Analysis and Prevention</full-title></periodical><pages>795-802</pages><volume>26</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0001-4575(94)90055-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A group of 72 impacted bicycle helmets were collected, primarily from manufacturers with a crash replacement policy that encourages the return of damaged helmets.

We have found that 67 kb of telomere-adjacent DNA at the right end of chromosome V in S. cerevisiae is replicated late in S phase. An ARS element in this region, ARS501, was shown by two-dimensional gel analysis to be an active origin of replication. Kinetic analyses indicate that the rate of replication fork movement within this late region is similar to that in early replicating regions. Therefore, the delayed replication of the region is a consequence of late origin activation. The results also support the idea that the pattern of interspersed early and late replication along the chromosomes of higher eukaryotes is a consequence of the temporal regulation of origin activation. © 1991.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025756992&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0092-8674%2891%2990468-E&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7b5eff694be635b6bc171d7906383933</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chary, P.</author><author>Latham, G.J.</author><author>Robberson, D.L.</author><author>Kim, S.J.</author><author>Han, S.</author><author>Harris, C.M.</author><author>Harris, T.M.</author><author>Lloyd, R.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vivo and in vitro replication consequences of stereoisomeric benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxide adducts on adenine N6 at the second position of N-ras codon 61</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>4990-5000</pages><volume>270</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.270.10.4990</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxide (BPDE), a metabolite of the widespread environmental pollutant benzo[a]pyrene, is mutagenic in both bacterial and mammalian systems. Toward understanding the mutagenic effects of different stereoisomers of BPDE at specific sites in DNA, six stereochemically defined BPDE adducts were constructed on adenine N6 at position 2 of the human N-ras 61 codon within an 11-base oligonucleotide fragment. Both the nonadducted and BPDE-adducted N-ras 61 11-mers were inserted into a unique EcoRI site in single-stranded M13mp7L2 DNA and utilized for in vivo studies. The ligation efficiencies of BPDE-adducted 11- mers into the single-stranded vector were determined by Southern hybridization and confirmed by electron microscopy. Repair-deficient AB2480 E. coli cells were transformed with adducted and nonadducted DNA samples. The resultant plaque-forming abilities were used to evaluate the replication competence of the various BPDE adducts with respect to the nonadducted 11- mer. Point mutations due to aberrant replication at the adducted site were identified by the technique of differential DNA hybridization. All of the six BPDE adducts examined were mutagenic in vivo, generating exclusively A→G mutations at frequencies ranging from 0.26 to 1.20%. In vitro replication studies using these BPDE-adducted 11-mers involved primer extension assays with Klenow fragment. All of the BPDE-modified templates demonstrated distinct blockage at the adducted site and/or 1 base 3' to the adducted site, allowing essentially no translesion synthesis to form fully extended polymerization products in vitro.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028959993&amp;doi=10.1074%2fjbc.270.10.4990&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=df2d44c800f1012befd964ff0eefdf25</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thompson, J.K.</author><author>Psaltis, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiple aspects and correlates of body figure ratings: A replication and extension of Fallon and Rozin (1985)</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Eating Disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Eating Disorders</full-title></periodical><pages>813-817</pages><volume>7</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>1988</year><pub-dates><date>1988</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/1098-108X(198811)7:6&lt;813::AID-EAT2260070612&gt;3.0.CO;2-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>College females, using a set of nine figure drawings reflecting very thin to very heavy figures, rated their current figure (based on how they thought they looked versus how they felt), ideal figure, how they appeared to others, and the figure they deemed most attractive to men. A subsample of the 123 subjects also completed measures of body satisfaction, depression, eating disturbance, teasing, and noted the age of menarche. The results replicated and extended the findings of Fallon and Rozin (1985), who found that ideal figures were smaller than ratings of current size. Additionally, there was a significant difference between the two protocols for current size, indicating that subjects rated their size as larger when asked to rate based on affective instructions. Figure ratings based on cognitive/rational instructions did not differ from those based on how they conceptualized others' views of their bodies. Significant correlations were observed among figure ratings, body satisfaction, eating disturbance, depression, and teasing. The need to focus on etiological mechanisms of disturbed body image and eating behavior is addressed, and the role of teasing as a possible precipitant is examined.

The kinetics of copy number correction from low to steady-state levels (termed repopulation) were determined using two different methods of copy number reduction. Thermosensitive replication (Tsr) mutants of pT181 were grown at nonpermissive temperatures to lower copy number and then shifted to a permissive temperature to allow repopulation. After the downshift, both wild-type and copy mutant plasmids, with active inhibitors, exhibited a burst of exponential replication that resulted in a two- to threefold overshoot of normal steady-state copy numbers. This was followed by inhibition of replication and eventual reestablishment of the steady-state replication rate. Similar replication kinetics were observed when these plasmids were introduced into naive cells by high-frequency transduction. By contrast, a pT181 copy mutant with a nonfunctional inhibitor-target regulation did not overshoot its steady-state copy number, but instead repopulated asymptotically. These results suggest that at low copy numbers, pT181 and its derivatives replicate at near-maximal rates and overshoot prior to the establishment of an inhibitory concentration of repressor. The maximal replication rate is independent of the plasmid's cop genotype. As the copy number increases, inhibitor accumulates and eventually reduces the replication rate. In the absence of an active inhibitor, the steady-state copy number is established at a level that must be limited by some other invariant factor. © 1987.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023333355&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0147-619X%2887%2990029-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=474739675f14c2a5986eaee2b423acb3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pal-Ghosh, R.</author><author>Morrow, C.D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A poliovirus minireplicon containing an inactive 2A proteinase is expressed in vaccinia virus-infected cells</title><secondary-title>Journal of Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>4621-4629</pages><volume>67</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>It has been difficult to evaluate the role of individual viral proteins in poliovirus replication because a suitable complementation system has not yet been developed. To approach this problem, we constructed a chimeric human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2)-gag-poliovirus minireplicon in which regions of the gag gene of HFV-2 were inserted in the poliovirus genome between nucleotides 1174 and 2470. Transfection of this chimeric RNA into HeLa cells results in the replication of the minireplicon and expression of an HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein which can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to HIV-2-gag. Expression of the HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein was dependent on replication of the chimeric RNA genome. Although the chimeric HIV-2-gag-poliovirus RNA genome replicated in poliovirus-infected cells, transfection of the chimeric HIV-2-gag-poliovirus genome into vaccinia virus-infected cells resulted in increased replication as measured by analysis of chimeric RNA. The increase in replication correlated with an increase in the expression of the HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein in vaccinia virus-infected cells. To characterize this system, we constructed a mutation in the 2A gene to change a cysteine at amino acid 109 to a serine. Expression of the HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein was not detected when the HIV-2-gag-poliovirus genome containing the 2A mutation was transfected into HeLa cells, demonstrating the mutation was lethal for replication. When the chimeric genome was transfected into poliovirus-infected cells, no RNA replication or expression of the HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein was observed. In contrast, transfection of this genome into vaccinia virus-infected cells resulted in replication of the chimeric RNA and expression of two proteins with larger molecular masses than the HIV-2-gag-P1 proteins, possibly representing HIV-2-gag-P1-2A and HIV-2-gag-P1-2ABC fusion proteins. The transfection of the chimeric HIV-2-gag-poliovirus genome containing the 2A mutation into poliovirus-vaccinia virus coinfected cells resulted in the expression and partial processing of the two larger HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion proteins to give the correct molecular mass for the HIV-2-gag-P1 fusion protein. The 2A mutation was reconstructed back into the full-length infectious cDNA of poliovirus. Transfection of this cDNA into vaccinia virus-infected cells followed by immunoprecipitation with anticapsid antibodies demonstrated the presence of two proteins with molecular masses larger than P1, possibly P1-2A and P1-2ABC fusion proteins. The results of this study suggest the proteinase activity of 2Apro is not required for RNA replication in vaccinia virus-infected cells and demonstrate the use of poliovirus minireplicons as a means to study poliovirus RNA replication.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027181611&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=42a746fed2aff70389816029ef7af7f0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sannerud, C.A.</author><author>Young, A.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Environmental modification of tolerance to morphine discriminative stimulus properties in rats</title><secondary-title>Psychopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychopharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>59-68</pages><volume>93</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1987</year><pub-dates><date>1987</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF02439587</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The development of tolerance to the discriminative stimulus properties of morphine was examined in rats trained to discriminate saline and 3.2 mg/kg morphine under a multiple timeout 15 min, 5 min fixed-ratio 30 schedule of food delivery. Generalization gradients were generated by administering increasing doses of morphine before successive timeout periods within the experimental session. Over the course of the study, the minimal discriminable dose (MDD) of morphine under control conditions fluctuated but did not systematically increase or decrease. Acute pretreatments of 3.2-17.8 mg/kg morphine 4-24 h before a generalization test resulted in minor changes in the MDD. To examine development of tolerance, supplemental doses of morphine (17.8 mg/kg) or saline were administered twice daily while discrimination training was either suspended or continued. Tolerance was assessed by weekly generalization tests. Greater tolerance developed to the morphine stimulus when training was suspended than when training was continued. For both training conditions, response rates during generalization tests were markedly suppressed during supplemental morphine administration, and original generalization gradients were recaptured within 2 weeks after termination of supplemental morphine administration. Supplemental saline administration did not alter the discriminative or rate-altering effects of morphine under either training condition. Thus, the magnitude of tolerance to a morphine discriminative stimulus reflected an interaction of supplemental drug treatment with the training conditions imposed during that treatment. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023200742&amp;doi=10.1007%2fBF02439587&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e19299928985147a743e97b62423a0a7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schweighoffer, T.</author><author>Schweighoffer, E.</author><author>Apati, A.</author><author>Antoni, F.</author><author>Molnar, G.</author><author>Lapis, K.</author><author>Banfalvi, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytometric analysis of DNA replication inhibited by emetime and cyclosporin A</title><secondary-title>Histochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Histochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>93-97</pages><volume>96</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1991</year><pub-dates><date>1991</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00266767</electronic-resource-num><abstract>DNA staining methods based on aspecific interactions with dye molecules have been replaced by an immunofluorescent approach to measure DNA replication.

In the first method, subjects were taught composite symbols by paired association, while in the second method, they were taught both the composite meaning of each symbol as well as the meaning of the elements from which it is comprised. Mean scores for learning (trials to criterion) and for generalization to the identification of novel symbols were analyzed. Analysis of variance indicated significant differences for both age and teaching method on learning and generalization scores. Results demonstrated that regardless of age, subjects learned more quickly when the meanings of symbol elements were included in training. Furthermore, subjects who received training on symbol elements were better able to generalize their symbol knowledge to the identification of novel stimuli. When retested 8 weeks after the initial training, subjects taught the meanings of symbol elements still performed significantly better than subjects trained by paired association. Clinical implications are discussed with reference to the training of Blissymbols as a graphic communication system with individuals who have speech impairments. © 1995, Informa UK Ltd.

Generalizability was assessed across judges, situational items, and methods for two populations: male psychiatric inpatient/day hospital patients, and a control sample of National Guardsmen. Results indicated that the SSIT displayed a number of desirable properties consistently across both samples and replicated the findings of a generalizability study on earlier form of the SSIT with an outpatient sample. Judges displayed very high agreement in their ratings of anxiety and social skills. Subjects displayed individual differences in their patterns of ratings across situational items. Ratings of anxiety and social skills showed good discriminant validity. Finally, judges' ratings showed low convergence with self-ratings. It was concluded that the SSIT is a highly reliable approach for obtaining ratings of anxiety and social skills that may be employed with several different populations of subjects. © 1983.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0039436981&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=00a93386378cdf74ae543037ae344701</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marx, B.D.</author><author>Smith, E.P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Principal component estimation for generalized linear regression</title><secondary-title>Biometrika</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biometrika</full-title></periodical><pages>23-31</pages><volume>77</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/2336046</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The generalized linear model (Nelder &amp; Wedderburn, 1972) has become an elegant and practical option to classical least-squares linear model building.

It is the objective of this paper to develop and present an asymptotically biased principal component parameter estimation technique, as an option to traditional maximum likelihood estimation for generalized linear regression. Both iterative and one-step principal component estimators are developed, directly compared, and can be particularly useful with the presence of an ill-conditioned information matrix. The bias, variance and mean squared error of principal component estimation will be quantified. Generalizations for rules of deletion of components will be examined.

Carcinogens were selected to include those known to react with DNA and those for which there was apparently no previous evidence for reaction with DNA In vivo. The method used depends on the increase in nuclear size that occurs in replicating cells. Replicating and nonreplicating diploid and tetraploid nuclei were fractionated in a sucrose gradient in a zonal rotor. Incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into replicating nuclei measured de novo replication of DNA, and hydroxyurea-resistant incorporation into non replicating nuclei measured repair replication. Diethylnitrosamine, ethyl methanesulfonate, aflatoxin, and retrorsine were shown to induce DNA repair replication in vivo but not to alter de novo synthesis two hr after injection. Carbon tetrachloride and ethionine also induced repair replication but only after a delay period. This suggests that the repair was that of damage caused by an indirect mechanism, such as by deoxyribonuclease activity resulting from lysosomal damage (carbon tetrachloride) or from nonenzymic reaction of DNA with a metabolite of the carcinogen that is slow to accumulate in liver (S-adenosylethionine after ethionine). Thioacetamide did not cause detectable repair replication, a result that correlates with the lack of evidence for a reaction between thioacetamide and DNA. © 1978, American Association for Cancer Research.

(2) Females attained to sexual maturity at younger age and at lighter body weight than did males. All the youngest mature individuals were found in the low and the increase phases. Age and size at maturity became older and larger as the population went toward the peak phase. (3) Maturation rate was strongly associated with population phase and density; this component is an important and good parameter to predict population trend. Maturation rates were in the order, the low phase&gt;the increase phase&gt;the peak phase&gt;the decline phase; the differences in the rates among these phases were significant. Maturation rate was somewhat depressed when the population density exceeded about 40 individuals/ha. Changes in age at maturity and in maturation rate are interpreted as derivative phenomena related to the population density and the capacity of the number of mature voles per unit area. (4) The maximum number of mature individuals were 26 males/ha and 29 females/ha; there was almost no increase of the number of mature voles at higher population densities over about 40 individuals/ha. The number of exclusive home ranges per hectare calculated from the observed range lengths did not differ much from the maximum number of mature voles of either sex. (5) Length of breeding period was shorter in the high-density years than in the low-density years; the breeding started earlier and ended earlier in the former than that in the latter. In the increase phase a few voles reproduced in winter. (6) The percentage of pregnant females was significantly lower in the peak phase than those in the other phases. © 1989 Society of Population Ecology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024894540&amp;doi=10.1007%2fBF02513201&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=33ec994553dea06b4bc2469af3796f20</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barton, E.J.</author><author>Bevirt, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization of Sharing Across Groups: Assessment of Group Composition with Preschool Children</title><secondary-title>Behavior Modification</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Behavior Modification</full-title></periodical><pages>503-522</pages><volume>5</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1981</year><pub-dates><date>1981</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/014544558154004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this study, generalization of sharing across groups was investigated and the influence of group composition (trained and nontrained subjects) on generalization was assessed. Six groups of subjects were formed by using 12 preschool children. Each group (two boys and two girls) was observed daily during 1510-minute free play sessions. Two groups were trained to share during Sessions 6 through 10; two groups were trained to share during Sessions 11 through 15; and two groups did not receive training. The effects of training a group to share generalized to nontrained groups. Generalization of sharing across groups reflected an increase in sharing within trained pairs, within nontrained pairs, between trained pairs, and between trained and nontrained pairs of children. Subsequent training with groups composed of trained and nontrained pairs further facilitated frequency of sharing. Results collectively suggest that the presence of a trained pair of children facilitates generalized increases in sharing across groups of preschool children, but that the remaining group composition is not a variable functional in this generalization.

Six bilingual Chinese students were recruited and divided into three pairs, each of which was exposed to a different baseline. During the treatment phase, a procedure including stimulus fading, verbal reinforcement and feedback was used to train Ss to identify SO Chinese characters presented from a distance. The dependent measures included a Chinese Behavioral Acuity Test (BAT) and an English BAT. The training was effective in improving performances on both tests during treatment and follow-up but the change was more pronounced on the Chinese BAT whose stimuli were also used for training. Unlike the behavioral measures, refractive errors of both eyes assessed before and after treatment showed only slight changes in half of the Ss. Together, these results suggest that effects of visual training only partially generalized to untrained stimuli. Implications for the interpretation of existing data and the direction of future research are discussed. © 1987.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023278485&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0005-7967%2887%2990088-X&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=827a5f7c79f06dd455cac05073e0c1bf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roszkowski, M.J.</author><author>Bean, A.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Believe it or not! longer questionnaires have lower response rates</title><secondary-title>Journal of Business and Psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Business and Psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>495-509</pages><volume>4</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF01013611</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The effects of questionnaire length on response rate and response bias were examined by conducting a mail survey of 8534 persons taking "distance education" courses in insurance and financial planning.

Encapsulation would provide a microenvironment conducive to interaction of the molecular species involved, and would further serve to differentiate such systems according to their reproductive success. Boundary structures could also provide permeability properties useful for the directed transport of nutrient molecules required for growth and replication.

I studied survival, growth, and reproduction in a wild population of southern water skinks (Eulamprus tympanum) over 3 yr to measure costs of reproduction in females, to examine how the environment influences these costs, and to assess the extent to which females are able to reduce costs. The proportion of mature females that reproduced each year varied from 30-60%. Frequent reproduction appeared costly in terms of both survival rates and growth. Growth rates and survival rates were negatively correlated with reproduction during the 3-yr study. In the coolest and wettest year of the study, when food intake by females was relatively low, gravid females and females that had reproduced in the previous year survived less well than nonreproducing females. There was no evidence of a survival cost of reproduction in the other two years of the study. Reproduction also imposed a fecundity cost, as overall, mean growth rates of reproducing females were reduced relative to those of nonreproducing females of the same body size. Reduced growth rate translates to reduced litter size in these skinks, because fecundity increases with body size. These results suggest that reproduction can be costly in terms of both survival and future reproduction in these skinks, but that survival costs are not consistent from year to year and are mediated by environmental conditions. Females appear to adjust their frequency of reproduction to minimize these costs, as those females that skipped opportunities for reproduction were those expected to gain the greatest growth and fecundity benefit by skipping. © 1993 by the Ecological Society of America.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027800391&amp;doi=10.2307%2f1940840&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5f02773d1abff0f5b6269240ffc39079</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Some observations on the issue of line generalisation</title><secondary-title>Cartographic Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cartographic Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>68-71</pages><volume>30</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1179/caj.1993.30.1.68</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This short article addresses some of the problems in cartographic generalisation, especially the mis-use of data point reduction algorithms for generalisation purpose.

Given that each cell typically contains multiple copies of organelles, each of which in turn contains multiple copies of the organelle genome, processes akin to drift and selection in a population are responsible for producing homoplasmic cells. This paper examines the expected substitution rate of new mutants by obtaining the probability that a new mutant is fixed throughout a cell, allowing for arbitrary rates of genome turnover within an organelle and organelle turnover within the cell, as well as (possibly biased) gene conversion and genetic differences in genome and/or organelle replication rates. Analysis is based on a variation of Moran's model for drift in a haploid population. One interesting result is that if the rate of unbiased conversion is sufficiently strong, it creates enough intracellular drift to overcome even strong differences in the replication rates of wild-type and mutant genomes. Thus, organelles with very high conversion rates are more resistant to intracellular selection based on differences in genome replication and/or degradation rates. It is found that the amount of genetic exchange between organelles within the cell greatly influences the probability of fixation. In the absence of exchange, biased gene conversion and/or differences in genome replication rates do not influence the probability of fixation beyond the initial fixation within a single organelle. With exchange, both these processes influence the probability of fixation throughout the entire cell. Generally speaking, exchange between organelles accentuates the effects of directional intracellular forces. Provided there is exchange among organelles, biparental inheritance further strengthens the role of directional intracellular forces in fixing the mutant throughout a population.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026696160&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=007cb2686b51d4cbcf005e4f2fa0b788</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smigielski, Jozef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inductance of a Short Multilayer Coil.</title><secondary-title>Prace Instytutu Maszyn Przep ywowych</secondary-title><short-title>INDUKCYJNOSC CEWKI O GRUBYM UZWOJENIU I MALEJ DLUGOSCI.</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Prace Instytutu Maszyn Przep ywowych</full-title></periodical><pages>91-105</pages><number>87</number><issue>87</issue><dates><year>1984</year><pub-dates><date>1984</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The general dependence of the inductance of a coil on its inner-to-outer diameter ratio and on its length is derived. The linear radial distribution of the magnetic field intensity as well as its non-uniform axial distribution are taken into account. Expressing the inductance in nondimensional form made it possible to reduce the number of variables by two and display the dependence on geometrical parameters in a simple diagram. The general relation is simplified to an approximate form suitable for practical use in the process of coil design. The results of computations are compared with measurement results, indicating satisfactory agreement. The relation derived makes possible rational generalizations of experimental results and particularly estimation of the dependence of the inductance on the geometrical parameters of the coil. The relation may be useful for optimum design of electromagnetic float-type-flowmeters based on the similarity principle.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0021659916&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=212c4de9d7017e2a5ca69c49ccfc3f75</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nawar, M.S.</author><author>Shereef, G.M.</author><author>Ahmed, M.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of food on development, reproduction and survival of Chiropturopoda bakeri (Acarina: Uropodidae)</title><secondary-title>Experimental &amp; Applied Acarology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental &amp; Applied Acarology</full-title></periodical><pages>277-281</pages><volume>17</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF02337277</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Chiropturopoda bakeri Zaher and Afifi was found in organic manure on the farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University at Giza.

Lag time analysis showed that high affinity binding of RF-C to the primer terminus required PCNA and that this complex was recognized by the polymerase. The formation of stable complexes was investigated through their isolation by Bio-Gel A-5m filtration. A stable complex of RF-C and PCNA on primed single-stranded mp18 DNA was isolated when these factors were preincubated with the DNA and with ATP, or, less efficiently with ATPγS. These and additional experiments suggest that ATP binding promotes the formation of a labile complex of RF-C with PCNA at the primer terminus, whereas its hydrolysis is required to form a stable complex. Subsequently, DNA polymerase δ binds to either complex in a replication competent fashion without further energy requirement. DNA polymerase ε did not associate stably with RF-C and PCNA onto the DNA, but its transient participation with these cofactors into a holoenzyme-like initiation complex was inferred from its kinetic properties and replication product analysis. The kinetics of the elongation phase at 30°, 110 nucleotides/s by DNA polymerase δ holoenzyme and 50 nucleotides/s by DNA polymerase ε holoenzyme, are in agreement with in vivo rates of replication fork movement in yeast. A model for the eukaryotic replication fork involving both DNA polymerase δ and ε is proposed.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025889702&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6c8a4607ebed462aea3e4e755fccf75a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sibuet, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep-sea benthic ecosystems: dynamic aspects</title><secondary-title>Use and misuse of the seafloor.

Major topics concern energy sources, trophic relationships, organic matter transformation, growth and reproduction, recolonization, environmental influences on benthic communities, and major characteristics of vent and cold seep ecosystems. The abyssal benthos, except in hydrothermal vents and cold seepage environments, appears to have a basic energetic relationship with its ultimate food source, the primary productivity of surface water. While the downward flux of particles, total benthic community respiration data, and some studies on reproduction rate all indicate spatial and temporal patterns, a major outstanding question is that of the pathways by which organic matter enters and flows through the benthic ecosystem. A new view of the deep-sea biological production related to hydrothermal vent fluids and cold seeps appeared when, in 1980, it was discovered that the intense growth of chemoautotrophic bacteria supports colonies of large, fast-growing vent animals. These have developed symbiotic relationships with the chemoautotrophic bacteria. -from Author</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027072884&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4e28b59ba3c7613d7840de332593d513</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sutherland, S.</author><author>Vickery Jr., R.K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trade-offs between sexual and asexual reproduction in the genus Mimulus</title><secondary-title>Oecologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oecologia</full-title></periodical><pages>330-335</pages><volume>76</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1988</year><pub-dates><date>1988</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00377025</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Six estimates of resource allocation to sexual reproduction (nectar concentration, nectar volume, sugar production, pollinator visitation rates, fruit-set, and seed production) and a single estimate of resource allocation to asexual reproduction (the rate of rooted-branch production) were examined for five species of Mimulus.

In this paper, we investigate the clipped Hebb rule for learning different networks of non-overlapping binary perceptrons under uniform distribution. We calculate exactly its learning curves in the limit of a large number of inputs, where the average behaviour becomes the typical behaviour. This calculation is performed using only very simple counting arguments and the central limit theorem. The results indicate that the clipped Hebb rule does indeed learn this class of networks. In particular, the generalization rates converge extremely rapidly, often exponentially, to perfect generalization. These results are very encouraging given the simplicity of the learning rule. The analytic expression of the learning curves are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21344487733&amp;doi=10.1088%2f0305-4470%2f26%2f21%2f015&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5d24dbf58a4d49608f6293916d761abc</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fernandez-Larsson, R.</author><author>Srivastava, K.K.</author><author>Lu, S.</author><author>Robinson, H.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication of patient isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in T cells: A spectrum of rates and efficiencies of entry</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>2223-2226</pages><volume>89</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>1992</year><pub-dates><date>1992</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.89.6.2223</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) undergo many different rates of replication, with the time course of replication being determined by the host cell and the virus. Recently, we demonstrated that the permissiveness of four CD4+ T-cell lines for the laboratory strain NL4-3 correlated with the rate and efficiency of virus entry. In this study, we have analyzed the replication of a "slow/low" isolate from the pre-AIDS period of infection and two "rapid/high" isolates from the AIDS period of infection to determine which steps in the virus life cycle determine differences in the growth characteristics of patient isolates. Differences in the growth of the patient isolates correlated with differences in entry but not postentry steps of the virus life cycle. The two rapid/high patient isolates (SF33 and SF216) underwent 50% entry in ≤0.5 hr in C8166 cells, in ≤1 hr in mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in ≥2.5 hr in H9 cells. In contrast, a class 3 slow/low patient isolate required 1 hr for 50% entry into C8166 cells, 3 hr for 50% entry into peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and 5-6 hr for 50% entry into H9 cells. Entry efficiency correlated with entry rate, with the rapid/high viruses having a 2-fold higher titer and the slow/low virus having a 5-fold higher titer on C8166 than H9 cells. The laboratory strain NL4-3 displayed intermediate rates and efficiencies of entry. These data demonstrate that entry characteristics are major determinants of the pathogenic potential of patient isolates.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026538675&amp;doi=10.1073%2fpnas.89.6.2223&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=37e826aeb6bf4a76a8a5e559d7665464</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Armstrong, A.C.</author><author>Matthews, A.M.</author><author>Castle, D.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Drainage models to predict soil water regimes in drained soils: a UK perspective</title><secondary-title>Irrigation and Drainage Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Irrigation and Drainage Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>205-215</pages><volume>9</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00880864</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Drainage is an intervention in the natural hydrology of the soil to alter the duration of adverse (waterlogged) soil conditions. The effects of drainage can be investigated by models that predict the position of the water table at a site in the presence of drainage. An inter-related series of models, which include the van Schilfgaarde non-steady state model, that have been used in the UK for the evaluation of drainage design options, are described. A simplified form of the van Schilfgaarde equation is presented, equivalent to a standard time series model, allowing both the efficient implementation of the model, and the inverse use of the model to derive performance parameters from observational data using statistical methods. A sensitivity analysis is used to investigate the relative importance of the two soil parameters, drainable porosity and soil hydraulic conductivity, on the performance of the model. This shows a far greater effect due to the variation of hydraulic conductivity. The use of a similar model to predict water tables in non-homogeneous soils has also been explored, including the investigation of a two-phase model to describe water movement in soils which are dominated by macropores. More useful, however, is the prediction of water table fluctuations in soils in which the soil hydraulic conductivity is a continuous function of soil depth, using the drainage theory of Youngs (1965). Solutions are presented for the logarithm of the hydraulic conductivity varying linearly with depth. The improvement in model performance is however gained at the expense of an additional parameter that describes the variation of hydraulic conductivity with depth. Some methods for deriving this parameter are discussed. Results from the use of this model are compared with those derived from the simple uniform conductivity model, showing superior performance. Lastly, the issue of soil lateral heterogeneity and the replicability of measurements is discussed. A detailed study of the variation of water table levels from a replicated drainage experiment indicates that in a practical situation very real limits exist on the accurate measurement of water tables, and that these present limits on our ability to verify models. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029502873&amp;doi=10.1007%2fBF00880864&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5c28c992bf19a638f816b6825ad53c3d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rich, Y.</author><author>Kedem, P.</author><author>Shlesinger, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancing intergroup relations among children: A field test of the Miller-Brewer model</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Intercultural Relations</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Intercultural Relations</full-title></periodical><pages>539-553</pages><volume>19</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0147-1767(95)00035-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Miller and Brewer's theoretical model was tested in a field experiment intended to reduce intercultural conflict between religious and secular Jewish Israeli children. 74 religious and 69 secular children participated in a joint enrichment program for gifted youth. Contact between the two groups was arranged so as to manipulate decategorization, by teaching academic content with an Interpersonal or Task orientation. In addition, the small activity groups in the enrichment programs were established according to Cross-cutting (Gender × Religiousness) or Convergent boundaries. Social acceptance of outgroup children was measured at the first session and after 6 weeks. At the tenth session generalization was measured. Results comparing the sixth session to the first, showed an increase in social acceptance towards religious outgroup members among ingender persons only, and for task oriented classes only. Generalization results indicated that the religious ingroup bias, exhibited at the first session, was eliminated. These findings raise questions regarding the applicability of the Miller-Brewer model when the conflict is real and intense, and field study rather than laboratory analogue conditions prevail. © 1995.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000564453&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0147-1767%2895%2900035-6&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f0f2ac98a6995595dd5c745239e8df55</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Latham, G.J.</author><author>Zhou, L.</author><author>Harrisi, C.M.</author><author>Harris, T.M.</author><author>Lloyd, R.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The replication fate of A- and S-styrene oxide adducts on adenine N6 is dependent on both the chirality of the lesion and the local sequence context</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>23427-23434</pages><volume>268</volume><number>31</number><issue>31</issue><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>In order to deduce the biological fate of adducts formed by the reaction of styrene oxide, a suspected carcinogen, with DNA, four oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized which contained either R- or S-styrene oxide lesions on the N8 position of neighboring adenines within the human N-ras codon 61. When these adducted oligodeoxynucleotides were ligated into the single-stranded vector M13mp7L2 and the modified DNA used to transform repair-deficient Escherichia coli, the resultant plaque-forming abilities were found to vary as much as 300-fold, depending on the stereochemical configuration of the styrene oxide lesion and the sequence context in the vicinity of the damage. The frequency of mutations caused by the various styrene oxide adducts were similarly dependent on both their chirality and local sequence context. Oligodeoxynucleotide templates bearing these same four adducts were also constructed in order to evaluate their replication in vitro by the Klenow fragment. Three of the four styryl-modified templates yielded significant levels of fully extended primer upon polymerization. In contrast, the template containing R-styrene oxide at the second position of N-ras 61 was a very poor substrate for replication, a result which correlates well with the observed lethality of this lesion in vivo.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027431846&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ee986126a86fd9f282fcfd15d52da837</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raymer, A.M.</author><author>Jacobs, B.</author><author>Legrand, H.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phonological treatment of naming deficits in aphasia model-based generalization analysis</title><secondary-title>Aphasiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aphasiology</full-title></periodical><pages>27-53</pages><volume>7</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02687039308249498</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A phonologically based treatment was implemented to train oral picture naming in four aphasic subjects with severe word-retrieval deficits. An initial assessment based on current cognitive neuropsychological models of naming indicated different levels of phonological and/or semantic deficits underlying naming failure across the subjects. Using a single-subject multiple baseline design across behaviours and subjects, the effects of treatment were evaluated by daily probing of both trained and untrained items across lexical tasks: oral naming, oral reading, and written naming. Results indicated successful acquisition of trained naming targets for the four subjects, and varied patterns of response generalization to naming of untrained phonologically and semantically related pictures, and to oral reading and written naming for the same words. Baseline levels of oral reading performance were noted to predict success in oral naming treatment. Differences in generalization patterns across tasks are discussed with regard to the varying functional levels of breakdown noted across subjects. This investigation demonstrates the utility of cognitive models in guiding the development of appropriate treatment strategies and generalization measures, and the importance of incorporating single-subject experimental designs in documenting changes associated with treatment. 0268-7038/93 $3 •00. © 1993, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

Order must be made of the great variability in soils across the earth, and distinctions must be made between natural and anthropogenic soil changes at varying space and time scales and between reversible and irreversible changes, again at varying scales. Moreover, because of gaps in the data and the paucity of work of this kind, a global assessment requires generalization of a high order. A full analysis can be achieved only through a step-by-step approximation procedure. Many of the "data', especially at the global scale, are a product of estimation and not the result of actual measurement. At the present stage of our efforts, it is impossible to avoid the controversy that is inherent in providing global estimates and generalizations. Our effort, however, provides an initial assessment, and points to the areas in which future research is especially needed, including the development of estimation methods. -from Authors</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025666094&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e5039031d22e0bb32bcf74782895c2bf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foxx, R.M.</author><author>Faw, G.D.</author><author>Nisbeth, I.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social skills training for inpatient emotionally disturbed children: A analysis of generalization</title><secondary-title>Child and Family Behavior Therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Child and Family Behavior Therapy</full-title></periodical><pages>11-37</pages><volume>12</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1991</year><pub-dates><date>1991</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1300/J019v12n04_02</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The generalization of social skills was assessed in a training program for six inpatient emotionally disturbed boys. Generalization was assessed with tow different sets of untrained social situations that contained similar and dissimilar situations to those used in training. One set was assessed during probes (interviews) conducted throughout training and the other in pre/post simulations. Social validity was considered by assessing a contrast group of ten normal boys in the simulation. A multiple baseline design across groups (N = 3) showed that there were increases in the subjects' trained skills. The probes revealed evidence for generalization across both types of situations for five subjects whereas the post simulation did so for three. The post simulation scores of these three subjects compared favorably to those of the en normal peers. The three subjects who displayed little or no generalization were noncompliant and unresponsive during the assessments. They also were younger and had lower IQs than the three subjects who displayed generalized responding. The implications of these results and suggestions for future research are discussed. © 1991 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Cellular replication studies showed that low (0.01 μg/cm2/day) and medium (0.1 μg/cm2/day) concentrations of rhuIL- 1β were not effective extending replication in pressure ulcer fibroblasts, in vitro. Tissue culture measurements from pressure ulcer biopsies demonstrated that, after 29 days of a high level of rhuIL-1β treatment (1.0 μg/cm2/day), the cytokine was effective in extending the ability of pressure ulcer fibroblasts to replicate. Tissue culture and electron microscopy suggested that, although rhuIL-1β promoted increases in fibroblast numbers, the primary effect appeared to be development of the extracellular matrix.

Although past studies have shown that self-instructional training programs can be employed to improve the performance of mentally retarded individuals in work situations, research has not examined whether this training format is superior to external instruction. To test Whitman's theory, mentally retarded adults were taught to perform a complex sequencing task through one of two training formats: self-instruction or external instruction. Performance was evaluated through the examination of accuracy measures obtained during training, maintenance, and generalization assessments. Results indicated that participants receiving self-instructional training were able to achieve and sustain a higher level of performance than participants receiving external instruction. While self-instructionally trained subjects also showed superior performance on the generalization assessment, these results were not statistically significant. Secondary analyses revealed that higher ability participants, self-instructionally trained participants, and participants who reached criterion on the training and generalization tasks self-verbalized more frequently during the various assessments. In contrast to prediction, there was no significant difference in the length of time required to train individuals in the two instructional groups. © 1987.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023180059&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0891-4222%2887%2990020-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=983a1ac2a384810eebb735badec2fbae</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Patten, M.S.</author><author>Yarish, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Allocation of blade surface to reproduction in Laminaria longicruris of Long Island Sound (USA)</title><secondary-title>Hydrobiologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrobiologia</full-title></periodical><pages>173-181</pages><volume>260-261</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00049017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sorus formation in the kelp Laminaria longicruris de la Pylaie (Phaeophyta) was quantified for a biennial population in Long Island Sound (Connecticut, USA), at the southern limit of its biogeographical range in the Western Atlantic Ocean. The allocation of blade surface to reproduction was measured monthly during two years, with additional samples taken at times of peak growth and reproduction. Sporophytes produced sori year-round, with the highest percentages of fertile plants (75 to 95 percent) occurring from October to December. The mean percentage of sorus area to blade ranged from 1 to 37 percent, remaining low and fairly constant during the spring and summer, but reaching much higher levels in the fall (when growth is minimal) and early winter. The comparatively low mean annual allocation of blade surface to reproduction (5 percent), was postulated to be due to temperature stress on these plants at the southern limit of distribution, but may instead be typical of the species. Such a small allocation of resources to reproduction nevertheless results in billions of spores per m2 of substrate, making a major contribution of material potentially available to grazing food webs. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027869035&amp;doi=10.1007%2fBF00049017&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a5b4d286e68e4ec734930a107c66d17d</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jonsson, B.G.</author><author>Söderström, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Growth and reproduction in the leafy hepatic Ptilidium pulcherrimum (G.

As a secondary problem, the two identified measures of kinesthetic sensitivity were also studied in relation to the independent variables of extent of forearm angular movement, direction of movement (supination or pronation), and order that the discrimination and reproduction tests were administered (transfer effect of first test on the second). There was little statistical relationship between kinesthetic discrimination and reproduction sensitivity measures. Both measures of kinesthetic sensitivity were similar in their relationship to the independent variables of extent, direction, and transfer. In both cases, the only significant main effect was that of extent (short movements more accurate than long). Kinesthetic discrimination was observed to be a much more stable measurement of kinesthetic sensitivity than movement reproduction.

STUDY DESIGN: Synchronous progression of diploid human fetal lung cells through S phase was achieved by releasing from serum restriction with minimum essential medium alpha modification plus 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by hydroxyurea blockage at the G1/S boundary. Deoxyribonucleic acid replication was studied in permeabilized cells using mercurated nucleotides to label nascent deoxyribonucleic acid. RESULTS: A high degree of synchrony in traversal of S phase was indicated by flow cytometry and a well-defined 7-hour period of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. The replication of the topoisomerase II gene occurred in a narrow time span 3 hours after entry into S phase.

Simian virus 40 chromatin containing radiolabeled DNA was extracted by the hypotonic method of Su and DePamphilis and then fractionated by sucrose gradient sedimentation into replicating (90S) and mature (70S) chromosomes. Viral chromosomes containing T-Ag were isolated by immunoprecipitation with saturating amounts of either an anti-T-Ag monoclonal antibody or an anti-T-Ag hamster serum under conditions that specifically precipitated T-Ag protein from cytosol extracts. An average of 10% of the uniformly labeled DNA in the 90S pool and 7.5% in the 70S pool was specifically precipitated, demonstrating that under these conditions immunologically reactive T-Ag was tightly bound to only 8% of the total viral chromosomes. In contrast, simian virus 40 replicating intermediates (RI) represented only 1.2% of the viral DNA, but most of these molecules were associated with T-Ag. At the shortest pulse-labeling periods, an average of 72 ± 18% of the radiolabeled DNA in 90S chromosomes could be immunoprecipitated, and this value rapidly decreased as the labeling period was increased. Electron microscopic analysis of the DNA before and after precipitation revealed that about 55% of the 90S chromosomal RI and 72% of the total RI from both pools were specifically bound to T-Ag. Comparison of the extent of replication with the fraction of RI precipitated revealed a strong selection for early replicating DNA intermediates. Essentially all of the RI in the 70S chromosomes were less than 30% replicated and were precipitated with anti-T-Ag monoclonal antibody or hamster antiserum. An average of 88% of the 90S chromosomal RI which were from 5 to 75% replicated were immunoprecipitated, but the proportion of RI associated with T-Ag rapidly decreased as replication proceeded beyond 70% completion. By the time sibling chromosomes had separated, only 3% of the newly replicated catenated dimers in the 90S pool (&lt;1% of the dimers in both pools) were associated with T-Ag. Measurements of the fraction of radiolabeled DNA in each quarter of the genome confirmed that T-Ag was preferentially associated with newly initiated molecules in which the nascent DNA was nearest the origin of replication. These results are consistent with a specific requirement for the binding of T-Ag to viral chromosomes to initiate DNA replication, and they also demonstrate that T-Ag does not immediately dissociate from chromosomes once replication begins. The biphasic relationship between the fraction of T-Ag-containing RI and the extent of DNA replication suggests either that 1 or 2 molecules of T-Ag remain stably bound until replication is about 70% completed or that 4 to 6 molecules of T-Ag are randomly released from each RI at a uniform rate throughout replication.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020595183&amp;doi=10.1128%2fjvi.48.1.281-295.1983&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=aaf07d879888cd99be165c4b09651609</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, S.B.</author><author>Bailey, J.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A mathematical model for λdv plasmid replication: Analysis of wild-type plasmid</title><secondary-title>Plasmid</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plasmid</full-title></periodical><pages>151-165</pages><volume>11</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1984</year><pub-dates><date>1984</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0147-619X(84)90020-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A mathematical model for λdv plasmid replication in a growing single cell of Escherichia coli has been formulated and solved numerically. Quantitative description of the molecular control mechanism for initiation of λdv replication presumes regulatory functions of repressor and initiator proteins and transcriptional activation of the origin region. Random selection of a single plasmid for activation and replication is assumed, as is regular plasmid segregation to daughter cells. The model is capable of simulating the periodic changes in each regulatory element and the plasmid copy number during the cell cycle. The calculated average copy number, repressor concentration, and timing of plasmid replication agree well with experimental data. The simulated λdv plasmid replication rate is controlled primarily by transcription frequency. Initiation of plasmid replication is not related to variations in the levels of repressor or initiator proteins during the cell cycle. Simulation studies of perturbations in plasmid and repressor segregation indicate that replication regulation of the λdv plasmid compensates to readjust copy number to normal values in a few generations. Implications of these studies relative to the molecular mechanisms of replication control are discussed. © 1984.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0021341080&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0147-619X%2884%2990020-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=07c689061fc4fc9e601c25ddac6c8b84</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nedavnij, O.I.</author><author>Maksimenko, B.V.</author><author>Osipov, S.P.</author><author>Udod, V.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multichannel radiometrical systems of testing with semi-tone visualization of shade radiation images.

In this study, we used MCF-7 cells, a human epithelial cell line known as a target for steroids. The effect of steroid hormone addition on the virus replication rate after infection by adenovirus-5 has been investigated. Various methods have been used to appreciate the successive events due to viral infection, cytopathy, viral protein and DNA newly synthetized. The production of complete viral particles was titrated in a reference system using HeLa cells. All parameters which have been evaluated indicate that viral production by MCF-7 cells infected by adenovirus-5 is increased by estradiol addition at physiological concentration. This effect is virus dose-dependent: it is detectable when low infectious doses are applied and increases with the dose. It is hormone dose-dependent: it is detected in the presence of 10-9 M estradiol and it is maximum for 10-8 M estradiol. Similar results are observed in the presence of 10-8 M DES, not in the presence of 10-6 M tamoxifen and 10-8 M 17β-estradiol. Other steroids like 5α DHT and glucocorticoid have been tested in this system and viral production was increased in the same order than with 17β-estradiol. The increase of viral production may be observed even if estradiol is not present in the medium when the viral infectious dose is applied. But the steroid must have been present until less than 6 h before infection. The specificity of the effect of steroids was assessed by using other steroids and estrogenic compounds and similar experiments of viral infection were carried out on cells without steroid receptors (MDA-231). None of these steroids induce any modification of viral production by MDA-MB-231 cells infected by adenovirus 5. These results suggest that some interference exists between both processes, cellular action of estradiol and virus replication. Results observed with other steroids suggest a mechanism specific of target cells. © 1981.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0019721678&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0022-4731%2881%2990283-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ef151705d1135d061834cb24eca74be5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leoni, A.</author><author>Fadda, M.</author><author>Nieddu, A.M.</author><author>Pittau, M.</author><author>Sanna, E.</author><author>Pirino, S.</author><author>Contini, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dermatophilosis in sheep: first report in Italy, experimental reproduction and evaluation of immune response.</title><secondary-title>Bollettino della Società italiana di biologia sperimentale</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bollettino della Società italiana di biologia sperimentale</full-title></periodical><pages>775-782</pages><volume>69</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>A severe exudative-crustous and proliferous dermatitis in a 2 year old sheep caused by Dermatophilus congolensis (observed for the first time in Italy), is reported.

BrdUrd incorporation was measured asa function of cell-cycle position, using an antibody against bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and dual parameter flow cytometric analysis. After exposure to UV light, there was an immediate reduction (∼ 50%) of BrdUrd incorporation in S phase cells, with most of the cells of the population being affected to a similar degree. At 5 h after UV, a population of cells with increased BrdUrd appeared as cells that were in G1 phase at the time of irradiation entered S phase with apparently increased rates of DNA synthesis. For 8 h after UV exposure, incorporation of BrdUrd by the original S phase cells remained constant, whereas a significant portion of original G1 cells possessed rates of BrdUrd incorporation surpassing even those of control cells. Maturation rates of DNA synthesized immediately before or after exposure by alkaline elution, were similar. Therefore, DNA synthesis measured in the short pulse by anti-BrdUrd fluorescence after exposure to UV light was representative of genomic replication. Anti-BrdUrd measurements after DNA damage provide quantitative and qualitative information of cellular rates of DNA synthesis especially in instances where perturbation of cell-cycle progression is a dominant feature of the damage. In this study, striking differences of subsequent DNA synthesis rates between cells in G1 or S phase at the time of exposure were revealed. © 1993.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027489928&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0027-5107%2893%2990162-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=49518a65fea6b3cc0ab04b6924a065db</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goetz, E.M.</author><author>Etzel, B.C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preschool Children's Acquisition, Maintenance, and Generalization: A Study of Three Reading Procedures</title><secondary-title>Behavior Modification</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Behavior Modification</full-title></periodical><pages>159-190</pages><volume>10</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1986</year><pub-dates><date>1986</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/01454455860102002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study examined the three reading procedures of sight, syllable blending, and phonics blending to determine which was the most efficient one to teach words for acquisition, maintenance, and various types of generalization. Six typical preschool children who did not recall and recognize the training words were selected as subjects. An individual analysis design was used in which all the subjects were taught all words, counterbalanced across the three reading procedures. All reading procedures were tailored to allow for the same number of training responses while using the identical modeling, imitation, and reinforcement technique. Results showed the sight procedure took the fewest training sessions to acquisition with the smallest number of errors, in comparison with syllable and phonics. But all words, regardless of the type of training, were maintained equally well. Considering the generalization measures, however, each procedure had unique advantages. Therefore, it is speculated how the three procedures might be combined for the beginning reader. © 1986, SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.

Few investigators ever have reported a replication of their initial study results, let alone the crossvalidation of such initial results. This article provides results of a four-year replication study of a medical behavioral treatment approach. Comparisons of patients receiving a uniform treatment were made at yearly intervals. A few variables are identified to clarify who will or will not achieve and maintain follow-up sobriety, although it is admitted that our knowledge in this area is still rudimentary. These results affirm for the practitioner today that the alcoholic patient is treatable with a high probability of success. When the outcome of treatment is positive, the diagnosis and referral become crucial for alcoholism just as for other treatable diseases. © 1982, American Medical Association.

To determine if the central location of the SGS is obligatory for its function in Mu replication, we pursued two lines of investigation. First, fragments of Mu DNA containing the SGS were inserted into various locations in a Mu prophage lacking the central SGS. Replication following induction was restored in all of the lysogens constructed, but the observed rate of replication for different prophages decreased with increasing distance between the new location of the SGS and the center of the genome. We also deleted different lengths of DNA from within the right half of a wild-type prophage, retaining the SGS and displacing it from a central location. Replication rates of the deleted prophages were reduced, with larger deletions resulting in larger reductions. Pairing deletions in the right half of the prophage with a deletion in the left half resulted in substantially higher rates of replication than observed with the right half deletions alone. We conclude that the SGS must be located centrally between the Mu termini for optimal rates of Mu replication. These results are discussed in terms of a model that proposes that the SGS is involved in organizing the topology of supercoiled prophage DNA to assist in synapsis of the Mu termini.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028237042&amp;doi=10.1073%2fpnas.91.15.7056&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d4659279677da1143d7b7a1f0a72a7dd</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bullock, R.J.</author><author>Svyantek, D.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analyzing Meta-Analysis.

These general problems are discussed, and some solutions are offered. © 1985 American Psychological Association.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000871263&amp;doi=10.1037%2f0021-9010.70.1.108&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7cd8ec825762596e28997ab147a74ee4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dorfman, D.D.</author><author>Berbaum, K.S.</author><author>Metz, C.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Receiver operating characteristic rating analysis: Generalization to the population of readers and patients with the jackknife method</title><secondary-title>Investigative Radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Investigative Radiology</full-title></periodical><pages>723-731</pages><volume>27</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>1992</year><pub-dates><date>1992</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/00004424-199209000-00015</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026664983&amp;doi=10.1097%2f00004424-199209000-00015&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7efcb9525bdd79491256da66bf72e592</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cress, D.E.</author><author>Jackson, P.J.</author><author>Kadouri, A.</author><author>Chu, Y.E.</author><author>Lark, K.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DNA replication in soybean protoplasts and suspension-cultured cells: Comparison of exponential and fluorodeoxyuridine synchronized cultures</title><secondary-title>Planta</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Planta</full-title></periodical><pages>241-253</pages><volume>143</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1978</year><pub-dates><date>1978</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00391994</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cell-suspension cultures of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr., line SB-1) have been used to study DNA replication. Cells or protoplasts incorporate either radioactive thymidine or 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) into DNA. The DNA has been extracted as large molecules which can be visualized by autoradiography. Nuclei were isolated and lysed on slides thus avoiding degradation of DNA by a cytoplasmic endonuclease. The autoradiograms demonstrated that DNA synthesis occurs at several sites tandemly arranged on single DNA molecules separated by center to center distances ranging from 10 to 30 μm. Velocity sedimentations through alkaline gradients confirm the lengths of the replicated regions seen in autoradiograms. By using velocity sedimentation it also has been possible to demonstrate that replication proceeds by the synthesis of very small (4-6S) DNA intermediates which join to form the larger, replicon-size pieces seen in autoradiograms. Both small (4-6S) and large (20-30S) intermediates are observed in synchronized and exponential cultures. However, after synchronization with fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) the rate of DNA synthesis is reduced. Since the size of intermediates is not reduced by FUdR treatment, it is concluded that the slower rate of replication results from a reduction in the number of tandem replication units but not in the rate at which they are elongated. After FUdR treatment, the density analogue of thymidine, BUdR, can be substituted for almost all of the thymidine residue in DNA, resulting in a buoyant density increase (in CsCl) from 1.694 to 1.747 g/cm3. Using this density analogue it is possible to estimate the amount of template DNA attached to new replication sites. When this is done, it can be shown that synchronized cells initiate replication at about 5,000 different sites at the beginning of S. (Each such site will replicate to an average length of 20 μm.) Use of BUdR also substantiates that at early stages of replication, very small replicated regions (&lt;8S) exist which are separated by unreplicated segments of DNA which replicate at a later time. Most of these conclusions agree with the pattern of DNA replication established for animal cells. However, a major difference appears to be that after prolonged inhibition of soybean cell replication with FUdR, very small, as well as replicon-size intermediates accumulate when replication is restored. This indicates that regulation of replication in these cells may be different from animal cells. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34250277048&amp;doi=10.1007%2fBF00391994&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c07ca70bbb611d339e57c60a78c0c7f1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schlosser, R.W.</author><author>Braun, U.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficacy of AAC Interventions: Methodologic Issues in Evaluating Behavior Change, Generalization, and Effects</title><secondary-title>Augmentative and Alternative Communication</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Augmentative and Alternative Communication</full-title></periodical><pages>207-223</pages><volume>10</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07434619412331276920</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The purpose of this paper is to discuss selected methodologic issues related to the evaluation of the efficacy of interventions in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). Previous literature is summarized for the evaluation of the effectiveness of AAC intervention programs as an organizational framework. Efficacy is then defined as an umbrella term, comprising not only effectiveness, but also efficiency and effects. Two indices, previously insufficiently addressed, are discussed in detail: (1) causal behavior change and (2) generalization. It is emphasized that demonstrations of causal behavior change require experimental research methodology rather than case study methodology. Generalization is defined and distinguished into stimulus and response generalization as two broad dimensions of generalization. Researchers are encouraged to explore the wide range of stimulus generalization conceivable in AAC and to evaluate whether collateral effects correspond conceptually to response generalization. The following variables are considered crucial, and are therefore discussed as such, to an accurate evaluation of generalization effectiveness: (a) the strategies used to induce generalization; (b) the number and type of dimensions involved; and (c) the design options selected to assess generalization effectiveness. As a further conceptual clarification of efficacy, it is proposed that treatment effects, including intermediate, instrumental, and ultimate effects, be distinguished, based on their roles in the treatment process. To date, AAC efficacy evaluation has primarily been concerned with intermediate effects. The authors propose that the evaluation of instrumental and ultimate effects also be considered in the evaluation of AAC interventions. © 1994, Informa UK Ltd.

The subtypes compared were defined by Research Diagnostic Criteria and were endogenous/nonendogenous, primary/ secondary, and Winokur's family history classification. As an extension of the research, we evaluated the endogenous subtype more precisely by distinguishing those patients who met criteria for probable endogenous, comparing them to both endogenous and nonendogenous depressed patients. The findings of the replication study were consistent with our earlier report; the incidence of both dexamethasone nonsuppression and reduced rapid eye movement (REM) latency was higher in those with endogenous depression. Findings for each of the other subtypes revealed no differences. The probable endogenous depressed patients were comparable to the nonendogenous depressed patients in all variables measured. © 1987.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023272232&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0006-3223%2887%2990085-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=56fb12a0aa89ec0cceff025fa37ac27e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Legendre, M.</author><author>Teugels, G.G.</author><author>Cauty, C.</author><author>Jalabert, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparative study on morphology, growth rate and reproduction of Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822), Heterobranchus longifilis Valenciennes, 1840, and their reciprocal hybrids (Pisces, Clariidae)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Fish Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Fish Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>59-79</pages><volume>40</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1992</year><pub-dates><date>1992</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1095-8649.1992.tb02554.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A detailed study on reproduction indicated that female C. gariepinus mature earlier (5–7 months) than female H. longifilis (12–14 months). In the reciprocal hybrids, female first sexual maturity was attained at 20–21 months. Both reciprocal hybrids and parental species displayed an equilibrated sex ratio. Macroscopical and microscopical observations revealed numerous abnormalities in gonadal development of the hybrids. GSI and fecundity in female hybrids were considerably lower than those found in the parental species. Moreover, intra‐ovarian tumors occurred in 20% of the hybrids. In hybrid males, GSIs were generally higher than those found in the parental species, but the spermatozoa concentration in the semen was about 100 times less. Despite these abnormalities, viable larvae, resulting from F2 and backcross fertilizations, were obtained. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

Using the central limit theorem and very simple counting arguments, we calculate exactly its learning curves (i.e. the generalization rates as a function of the number of training examples) in the limit of a large number of inputs. We find that the learning curves converge exponentially rapidly to perfect generalization. These results are very encouraging given the simplicity of the learning rule. The analytic expressions of the learning curves are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations, even for moderate values of the number of inputs.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027866037&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=72d94a3fc908386dddaec2962f5b2550</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berndtson, W.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication requirements and number of ejaculates needed for assessing treatment effects on sperm output and seminal characteristics of electroejaculated Holstein bulls.</title><secondary-title>Journal of animal science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of animal science</full-title></periodical><pages>709-718</pages><volume>68</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2527/1990.683709x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Two ejaculates were harvested by electroejaculation on each of 3 d per week for 14 wk from 14, 12- to 24-mo-old Holstein bulls. Ejaculates during the first 2 wk served to stabilize sperm output. Data for the remaining ejaculates were used in a components of variance approach to determine the number of bulls per treatment and ejaculates per bull that would be needed to provide adequate sensitivity and precision for assessing treatment effects on seminal characteristics. The latter included the number of sperm (total and motile), volume and sperm concentrations of the sperm-rich fraction, and the percentage of progressively motile sperm in first and second ejaculates or per day. Replication requirements declined as the number of ejaculates per bull was increased to about 15 to 25 but declined minimally thereafter. The number of bulls needed per treatment varied in relation to the size of the treatment response to be detected but was much greater than the replication used in typical experiments. Replication for assessing sperm output in first ejaculates or per day was approximately one-half as great for experiments in which pretreatment information was used to adjust post-treatment data. Tables should be useful as a guide for designing efficient, cost-effective studies of known sensitivity and precision.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025391303&amp;doi=10.2527%2f1990.683709x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4bc8756c3282842b1fa4aeceeccb5928</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Griest, D.L.</author><author>Forehand, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How can i get any parent training done with all these other problems going on?: The role of family variables in child behavioral therapy</title><secondary-title>Child and Family Behavior Therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Child and Family Behavior Therapy</full-title></periodical><pages>73-80</pages><volume>4</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1983</year><pub-dates><date>1983</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1300/J019v04n01_08</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although parent training generally has been successful, sufficient data exist to indicate that treatment outcome is not always positive. Several investigators have suggested that problems in the family system may be responsible for the failures, which occur. The present paper reviews the relationship between three family problem variables (parental maladjustment, marital difficulties, and dysfunctional extra familial interactions) and child behavior problems and their treatment. The available data suggest that there is a positive relationship between child behavior problems and problems in each of the three types of family variables. Furthermore, although less conclusive, some data suggest that the outcome of parent training is affected adversely by poor parental personal, marital, and extra-familial adjustment. Assessment of generalization form parent training to family problems has yielded mixed results; generalization has occurred primarily to parental personal adjustment. Finally, comparisons of parent training alone to parent training plus treatment of family problems have not been undertaken, Areas for future investigation are discussed. © 1982 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

A single subject, multiple base line across subjects design was used. After a brief base-line probe phase, general case simulation instruction was introduced sequentially to three participants. Intermittent probes in three other untrained settings were conducted to assess generalization. Data from all three participants indicate that generalization did occur from general case training to the untrained probe settings. They showed an average increase of 45 percent for participant one after six training sessions, an average increase of 58 percent after four training sessions for participant two, and after only one training session, an average of 37 percent for participant three. Degree of generalization was inversely related to the severity and complexity of participant disability.

At the time of entrance into the study, the infants were 34 to 35 weeks old and were documented poor feeders. Treatment consisted of individual, multimodal sensory stimulation, with emphasis on proprioceptive and vestibular input, graded to the sensory needs of the infants. Movement components of the jaw and tongue during nutritive and nonnutritive sucking were measured during baseline and intervention phases to assess the infants' sucking ability. A comparison of testing results revealed that during intervention the total sucking scores improved significantly for two of the three infants and that rapid changes occurred in the oral-motor function of all three infants. The results of the study suggest that occupational therapy can improve the rate of development of sucking in the premature neonate. However, future research needs to be done to isolate the specific techniques of treatment that produce positive changes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024066836&amp;doi=10.5014%2fajot.42.8.499&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ca84c789d5beefb824e2f19fb93c1094</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schumaker, J.B.</author><author>Ellis, E.S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social skills training of LD adolescents: A generalization study</title><secondary-title>Learning Disability Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Learning Disability Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>409-414</pages><volume>5</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1982</year><pub-dates><date>1982</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/1510924</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of role playing as a device for assessing generalization of social skills training and to determine the extent to which LD adolescents generalize specific social skills to the natural setting following training. LD high-school students' social skills were observed in two types of situations before and after training: (a) contrived (but unobtrusive) situations in the subjects' natural environment, and (b) novel role-playing situations. Results suggested that LD adolescents do not automatically generalize recently learned social skills to novel role-playing situations and the natural environment. Also, high performance in a novel role-playing situation does not necessarily mean that a student will show a correspondingly high performance in the natural environment. Consequently, it appears that learning disabled adolescents must be trained to generalize newly learned social skills, and that generalization of newly learned social skills should be measured in the learner's natural environment. © 1982, Council for Learning Disabilities.

Replication errors were scored using two M13 DNA substrates having the replication origin on opposite sides of the lacZ α-complementation gene. The data suggest that the average rates for replication errors resulting from G(template), T·dGTP, and A·dGTP mispairs are 25 x 10-6, 12 x 10-6, and 3 x 10-6, respectively. The data also suggest that error rates for both the (+) and (-) strands differ by less than 2-fold when they are replicated either as the leading or lagging strand. This is in contrast to the 33- and 8-fold differences observed earlier for G·dTTP and C·dTTP mispairs on the (+) strand when replicated by the leading or lagging strand complex (Roberts, J. D., Izuta, S., Thomas, D.C., and Kunkel, T. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1711-1717). Thus, the relative fidelity of the leading and lagging strand replication proteins varies with the mispair and sequence considered. Misincorporation of dGTP preferentially occurs at template positions where dGTP is the next correct nucleotide to be incorporated. This 'next nucleotide' effect is characteristic of reduced exonucleolytic proofreading and suggests that these replication errors are normally proofread efficiently. Fidelity measurements performed in the absence or presence of dGMP, an inhibitor of proofreading exonuclease activity, suggest that the leading strand replication complex proofreads some mispairs more efficiently than does the lagging strand replication complex.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028869927&amp;doi=10.1074%2fjbc.270.6.2595&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f99a1889e4e8ad2314804fee21592e72</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Simerl, N.A.</author><author>Wilcox, C.J.</author><author>Thatcher, W.W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Postpartum Performance of Dairy Heifers Freshening at Young Ages</title><secondary-title>Journal of Dairy Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Dairy Science</full-title></periodical><pages>590-595</pages><volume>75</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1992</year><pub-dates><date>1992</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(92)77796-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Records from Florida Agricultural Experiment Station dairy herd for 1144 heifers freshening from 1959 to 1979 were studied to evaluate effects of age and problems at parturition on subsequent yield and reproduction. Statistical analysis was by method of ordinary least squares analysis of variance; five measures of reproduction, survival to second lactation, and 15 measures of yield were studied. Mean first parturition age was 25.8 mo with 40% of individuals ≤23 mo; survival to second parturition was 67%. No effects of age at first parturition were detected on survival, postpartum reproductive performance, or milk composition other than lactose-mineral, chloride, and acidity percentages; effects on yield were similar to previous reports. Stillbirth did not affect subsequent reproductive performance but was associated with decreased milk yield: 181 kg or 5.2% of overall mean. Milk yield was depressed by 239 kg for retained fetal membrane, 173 kg for dystocia, and 98 kg for metritis; milk composition essentially was unaltered. Heritability of postpartum days to first estrus was .14; estimates were 0 for days to first service, days open, and calving interval. Additional research is needed on interrelationships of gestation length with subsequent yield and reproduction and in alleviating detrimental effects of problems at parturition. © 1992, American Dairy Science Association.

Since replication rates are similar in both 'halves' of the chromosome, termination presumably occurs at the meeting point of the two replication forks. To investigate whether the DNA sequence of this region of the chromosome contributes to the termination event, the authors have determined the latest replicating region of a chromosome in which this DNA sequence is no longer symmetrically opposite to the origin. The merodiploid strain GSY1127 has a very large nontandem duplication (approximately 25% of the total chromosome length) in the left-hand half of the chromosome, so that size and symmetry of this chromosome are grossly different from those of normal strains. The authors have examined the replication order of genetic markers in this strain by measuring marker ratios during synchronous replication. The results show that a normal B. subtilis terminal marker for replication remains a terminal marker in the merodiploid, i.e., replicates later than a marker situated symmetrically opposite to the replication origin. These results were supported by replication orders determined by pulse-density transfer experiments during synchronous replication. The data obtained indicate that there is a preferred site for the termination of replication in the B. subtilis chromosome.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020319330&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=49249b6aa05ed2800b459e5200aa18d9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foxx, R.M.</author><author>McMorrow, M.J.</author><author>Mennemeier, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TEACHING SOCIAL/VOCATIONAL SKILLS TO RETARDED ADULTS WITH A MODIFIED TABLE GAME: AN ANALYSIS OF GENERALIZATION</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</full-title></periodical><pages>343-352</pages><volume>17</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1984</year><pub-dates><date>1984</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1901/jaba.1984.17-343</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this study, a social skills training program for institutionalized mildly or moderately retarded adults was extended to include skills relevant to vocational settings.

The factor structure is more clearly defined than in the original normative study, and a primary factor of hyperactivity emerged, accounting for 39% of the variance. Six factors that emerged, all with eigenvalues of 1.00 or more, accounted for 69% of the variance. Hyperactivity and conduct factors, which are consistent over multiple studies, emerged. Items consistent with inattentive, unsociable, and passive behavior also separated into discrete factors. This suggests that using a mixed clinical population produces a clearer delineation of factors, which may provide the basis for subtyping a clinical population. Use of the TBRS as the diagnostic measure in medication studies, and its relationship with the abbreviated Teacher Rating Scale (ATRS), are explored. © 1988 by Williams &amp; Wilkins.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024099569&amp;doi=10.1097%2f00004703-198810000-00005&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=393aa30932d044588e7be36511f02727</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nolen, G.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A reproduction/teratology study of brewed and instant decaffeinated coffees</title><secondary-title>Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health</full-title></periodical><pages>769-783</pages><volume>10</volume><number>4-5</number><issue>4-5</issue><dates><year>1982</year><pub-dates><date>1982</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/15287398209530294</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were given, in place of their drinking water, full-strength or 50 or 25% dilutions of either brewed or instant decaffeinated coffees for about 6 mo from weaning. These levels are equivalent to the human consumption of about 50, 25, or 12 cups of coffee per day. Controls were given either distilled water, or full-strength or a 25% solution of regular brewed coffee. The rats were bred twice after 91 d to assess reproduction and teratogenicity. The parent animats given decaffeinated coffees and 100% regular coffee drank less than the rats given water, while the rats given 25% regular coffee drank more. No effects on body weight gain or feed efficiency were seen, except that the group given 100% regular coffee gained significantly less weight than the water controls. None of the coffee treatments had a significant effect on reproductive characteristics such as conception rate, number born, or number weaned. During the second pregnancy, no significant effects from the coffee treatments were seen on early embryotoxicity measured in dams sacrificed on d 13 of pregnancy or fetal toxicity in dams sacrificed on d 21. No significant fetal abnormalities due to any of the coffee treatments were observed in either soft-tissue or skeletal examinations, although there was a significant increase in unossified sternebrae in the fetuses from dams given the full-strength regular coffee. © 1982 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020465405&amp;doi=10.1080%2f15287398209530294&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=29738c4a9acc3b6fffe78d0b68105d91</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iwan, L.G.</author><author>Jeffries, B.C.</author><author>Turner, H.N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of heterosis in Merino × Corriedale crosses with sheep</title><secondary-title>Australian Journal of Agricultural Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian Journal of Agricultural Research</full-title></periodical><pages>521-535</pages><volume>22</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1971</year><pub-dates><date>1971</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/AR9710521</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reproduction rate data (lambs born, lamb survival rate, and lamb body weight) are presented for purebred Merino and Corriedale ewes and their reciprocal crosses. The four breeds were born in each of two years (1961 and 1962) and mated in each of two years (1963 and 1964, 1964 and 1966) to Dorset Horn rams. Heterosis was estimated as the superiority of the mean of the crossbreds over the mean of the purebreds, expressed as a percentage of the latter. The heterotic effect for lambs born per ewe joined was 1.9 % in 2-year-old ewes and 5.3 % in adults, the corresponding figures for lamb survival being 3.5 and 1.4 % for single-born, 17.2 and 12.0% for twin-born lambs. For mean age-corrected lamb body weight, 2-year-old ewes showed a heterotic effect of 3.7 % and adult ewes 2.0 %, while for pounds of lamb weaned per ewe joined the figures were 11.3 and 10.2%. Although some heterosis was exhibited, the mean of the crossbreds seldom exceeded that of the superior parent (the Corriedale), and there were sometimes differences between the reciprocal crosses, the Corriedale × Merino cross being superior in performance to the other. The potential for exploiting this degree of heterosis in reproduction rate cannot be assessed until the corresponding wool data have been analysed. In reproduction rate, the Corriedale was superior to the Merino, but again a final conclusion about their merits must await results on wool data. © 1971, CSIRO.

The autoradiographic experiments were designed to show whether the larger amounts of nuclear DNA are correlated with more rapid rates of synthesis and/or with longer replication units. - The DNA replication rate was 2.5 μ/minute (corrected for two growing points) with 10 minutes 3H-thymidine label at 22° C, but decreased with longer labelling durations. The length of the replication unit (estimated by the distance from the center of one autoradiograph to the center of the next in sequence) was most commonly in the 10-25 μ range with a 30 minute label, in all four species. The average center-to-center distance was 8 μ at 10 minutes and increased with label duration, to over 45 μ with 24 hours label. Replication was predominantly but not exclusively bidirectional.

In both experiments college students guessed whether a slide having a dot on it would follow a slide presenting a word. Although several words were presented, the dot followed only one of the words, and then in accordance with a particular reinforcement (PR) schedule. In Experiment 1 five groups of Ss (total N = 234) responded, respectively, to a PR-0%, −25%, −50%, −75%, or −100% schedule. After acquiring a “yes” (a dot will follow) response to the reinforced word, generalization was assessed through differential resistance to extinction towards a synonym, a homonym, and two words unrelated to the conditioning word. A second experiment was conducted using only a PR−25% group (N = 105). In both experiments Ss' acquired rate of “yes” responses tended to match the probability of reinforcement involved in their PR schedule. In both studies generalization was greatest towards synonyms, less towards homonyms, and least towards irrelevant words. However, the differential magnitude of semantic generalization over homophonic generalization was slight, and diminished and disappeared rapidly as a function of extinction trials. © 1976 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84950893033&amp;doi=10.1080%2f00221309.1976.9711613&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=48465ab93298a21d0ecbdcc600d7e5e5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anderson, A.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Shape perception in the honey bee</title><secondary-title>Animal Behaviour</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal Behaviour</full-title></periodical><pages>67-79</pages><volume>25</volume><number>PART 1</number><issue>PART 1</issue><dates><year>1977</year><pub-dates><date>1977</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0003-3472(77)90068-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Data from a series of generalization experiments measured the degree of similarity, perceived by the honey bee, between a training shape and each of a set of test shapes.

Death rates have fallen dramatically in the past several decades, but annual birthrates remain at around 4 percent of population. Income per head is rising slowly. Enough is known about the main parameters that a demographic-economic computer model can be used to assess the effects of declining fertility rates on various indices of economic welfare in a typical less-developed country. Thus halving in 30 years a 3.025 gross rate of reproduction results in income per head increasing 3.0 percent a year instead of 1.7 percent a year with no fertility change. Halving fertility also results in a third more capital per worker after 30 years. A large birth-control program might directly cost about $5 a year per "acceptor." About 25 percent of the population aged 15 through 49 would have to practice contraception on an average to halve the gross reproduction rate in 30 years. During this period the total cost might be roughly $200 million for a less-developed country that started with a population of 10 million. Accumulated benefits could be $16 billion. The benefit to cost ratio is roughly 80 to 1.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0014680893&amp;doi=10.1126%2fscience.164.3881.798&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=04d9fccfa56315d523b322fd6fc1b502</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taguchi, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Reproduction Situation of Pacific Salmon (Oncorhynchus Spp.) in Alaska I.

But the reproduction situations of salmon resources which are the scientific basis of fishery management are not cleared with a little exception of the study for red salmon. In this paper, the reproduction situations of pink salmon resources both in Central Alaska and Southeastern Alaska are studied separately in odd year and even year class groups, using the Ricker's formula (R = aEe-bE). To estimate the reproduction curves for each stocks, numbers of escapements and returns are estimated from the catch statistics under the adequate assumption, for fishing rate. Following tables and figures resulted from above estimations show that the recent decrease of catches in Central Alaska and Southeastern Alaska may have been brought about by the decrease of escapement and the fall of reproduction rate respectively. © 1965, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Tests with various host-virus combinations suggest that these changes are specific for TYMV rather than the host species. We suggest that these changes are induced by the virus and are directly connected with the requirements of virus replication. The findings support the view that TYMV is primarily a parasite of the chloroplast. The following properties are permanently changed by TYMV infection, and the observed reductions occur only toward the end of the period of virus replication: (i) rate of carbon fixation, (ii) concentration of fraction I protein and ribulose diphosphate carboxylase activity. Previous work has shown that these changes also occur with other viruses. © 1973.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0015892778&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0042-6822%2873%2990467-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=69c25973802084ff6fecac62c4342ca8</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Müller, H.J.</author><author>Hennig, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Über die Ursachen der Unterschiedlichen Resistenz von Vicia faba L. gegenüber der Bohnenblattlaus, Aphis (Doralis) fabae Scop - VI.

To ensure a solid and inflexible connection between the partners to be grafted a glass capillary was fitted in the stem hollows of both the scion and the stock. In "pertelar" cages (Müller 1954) one young aptera of Aphis fabae could choose to infest a leaf of a grafted scion or a leaf of a normal plant. The percentage of initial colonies established by 740 such tested virginoparae decreased from 90,6 (S/R+S) to 78,5 (S/R+R), 76,7 (R/S+S) and 48,8% (R/S+R). In all cases, where a decision was possible at all, S-leafs were preferred to R-leafs, independently of whether they grew on a scion or on a normal plant (Table I): With reproduction rate experiments the percent of apterous virginoparae settling on grafts and controls dropped in a similar manner from 51,0 on S and 43,9 on S/R to 21,8 on R and 17,7 on R/S respectively (Table II). Also the reproductive rate (number of larvae born by an apterous virginopara in the time between the birth and maturity of its first born daughter decreased from S (33,6+-9,0) and S/R (31,8+-8,3) to R (27,2+-8,2) and R/S (26,7+-7,9)). There is no statistically significant difference between S and S/R on the one side and R and R/S on the other (Fig. 4). The diminution of numbers from S to S/R and from R to R/S respectively in all experiments is suggested to be an effect of grafting in itself rather than a mutual influence of the partners. The present results prove that both the preference-nonpreference-und the antibiosismechanism of the relative aphid resistance of R-and S-field beans are not altered by the stock after reciprocal grafting. In view of this and the findings of Harvey &amp; Hackerott (1958) on alfalfa resistance against Therioapbis maculata substances produced by the roots cannot be the cause of aphid resistance. © 1960 NORTH-HOLLAND PUBLISHING COMPANY, Amsterdam/Kluwer Academic Publishers.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34250606551&amp;doi=10.1111%2fj.1570-7458.1960.tb02122.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ff154f047d2ae5a4d2083b6da2f53a78</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Enquist, L.W.</author><author>Skalka, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication of bacteriophage λ DNA dependent on the function of host and viral genes.

Our results show that the rate of phage DNA replication is abnormally low in the absence of red function, in rec+ as well as rec- (A- and A-B-) bacteria. It appears that the virus general recombination proteins play some role in lambda replication that cannot be assumed by the general recombination proteins of its bacterial host. The red- defect in replication results in a decrease in the total amount of intracellular phage DNA. This DNA, nevertheless, seems normal in structure and is matured and packaged with good efficiency. In rec+ and recA- hosts infected with gam- mutants, the rate of lambda replication is also low, but in this case, abnormal DNA structures are produced at late times. The gam mutation seems to alter the program of replication such that circular molecules are produced not only at early times, but continuously, throughout the lytic cycle. This, and other facts, suggest that the gam protein is required for the transition from "early" to "late" replication. This requirement for gam function is not observed in recA-B- hosts, in which gam mutants replicate at a normal rate and produce DNA indistinguishable from that made by wild type phage. Thus, the gam requirement seems to involve an interaction of this phage protein with the product of the host's recB gene. Other evidence for such interaction comes from our finding that, in vivo, the gam protein does inhibit presumed action of the host's BC nuclease. In the gam- mutant infections, which are blocked in late replication, absence of a general recombination system seems to create a severe defect in maturation of intracellular phage DNA. This defect, unlike the one affecting λ replication rate, can be alleviated by either the red or rec functions and is correlated with the inability of the mutant phages to make DNA concatemers. Since other late functions (i.e. late messenger RNA production) appear to be normal, we conclude that concatemer formation, via replication or recombination, is an essential step in phage development. © 1973.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0015914828&amp;doi=10.1016%2f0022-2836%2873%2990016-8&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a150d47b6cb9b84b992450e99739718b</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klevecz, R.R.</author><author>Stubblefield, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RNA synthesis in relation to DNA replication in synchronized Chinese hamster cell cultures</title><secondary-title>Journal of Experimental Zoology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Experimental Zoology</full-title></periodical><pages>259-267</pages><volume>165</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1967</year><pub-dates><date>1967</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jez.1401650210</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Selection and reversal of Colcemid‐blocked mitotic cells yielded synchronous populations of 90% purity, representing 10% of the original culture. This system gave sufficient material to allow the isolation of RNA, pulse‐labelled with tritiated uridine, in various stages of the cell cycle. Sucrose gradient sedimentation of such isolations showed that incorporation of the isotope into the most rapidly sedimentating RNA fractions was greater in S and G2 than it was in G1. In addition, the total amount of labelled RNA in a given pulse was greater following the initiation of DNA synthesis. The rate of RNA synthesis increased following mitosis and reached an initial plateau after one hour. A second increase in rate was observed three hours later, or about one hour after the beginning of DNA synthesis. Several peaks in synthetic rate seemed to be superimposed on the overall increase. Short pulse times appeared to accentuate the discontinuous nature of the rate curve, while longer pulse times made the cyclic peaks more obvious. Inhibition of DNA synthesis with 1 mM thymidine prevented the change in RNA synthetic rate from occurring. The doubling in RNA synthetic rate is interpreted to be the result of replication of the functional DNA templates. The periodic fluctuations in rate suggest that, although the potential for RNA synthesis is doubled with DNA replication, the rate at any instant is not totally determined by the gene dosage.

Analysis of generalization (G) scores (abstraction) indicated that within the general context of normals exceeding good premorbid schizophrenics and goods exceeding poors, white noise had opposing effects on the good and poor premorbid schizophrenic Ss, especially under the no repetition condition. Good premorbids increased and poor premorbids decreased G scores under the white noise. Information (I) scores were significantly higher among normals than among the poor premorbid schizophrenics, with the good premorbid schizophrenics falling in between.
